<ArticleTitle>Intermediate and deep layers of the macaque <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion>: a Golgi study.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>We studied the intermediate and deep layers of the macaque <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion> by means of the Golgi technique in an attempt to better understand the structural features of this important oculomotor center. For this study, we examined the optic (<BrainRegion>stratum opticum</BrainRegion>, SO), intermediate gray (<BrainRegion>stratum griseum intermedium</BrainRegion>, SGI), intermediate white (<BrainRegion>stratum album intermedium</BrainRegion>, SAI), and deep gray (<BrainRegion>stratum griseum profundum</BrainRegion>, SGP) layers. These are the four layers in which neurons having saccade-related activity are localized. We identified eight neuronal types on the basis of differences in somatic and dendritic morphologies: large multipolar neurons (Type I); large pyramidal neurons (Type II); large fusiform neurons (Type III); medium fusiform neurons with spiny, radially oriented dendrites (Type IV); medium round neurons with fan-shaped dendritic trees (Type V); medium stellate neurons with varicose dendrites (Type VI); medium multipolar neurons with robust, spiny dendrites (Type VII); and local interneurons (Type VIII). Most neuronal types possessed features that are homologous to presynaptic dendritic features in other brain centers. With the exception of the medium stellate neurons (Type VI), which are aspinous, and the local interneurons (Type VIII), which are sparsely spinous, all other types had a moderate number of spines on their dendrites. Dendrites that terminated in the <BrainRegion>optic layer</BrainRegion> had specializations not observed elsewhere, suggesting that these tips may sample a tectal afferent that is not present in the more ventral layers. These eight types comprise all the neuronal morphologies observed in a large number of Golgi-impregnated macaque brains (n = 50). We suggest that they represent the full range of neuron types in the saccade-related layers of the macaque <BrainRegion>tectum</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Connections of the <BrainRegion>subthalamic nucleus</BrainRegion> with <BrainRegion>ventral striatopallidal parts of the basal ganglia</BrainRegion> in the rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The present study was undertaken to establish the precise anatomical relationship of the <BrainRegion>subthalamic nucleus</BrainRegion> (STh) with <BrainRegion>limbic lobe-afferented parts of the basal ganglia</BrainRegion> in the rat. The anterograde tracer Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin (PHA-L), injected in the <BrainRegion>subthalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>(STh) , the <BrainRegion>globus pallidus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>ventral pallidum</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>ventral striatum</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>parafascicular thalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>, and the retrograde tracers Fluoro-Gold (FG) and cholera toxin B (CTb), injected in the <BrainRegion>globus pallidus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>ventral pallidum</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>ventral striatum</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>ventral mesencephalon</BrainRegion>, were used for this purpose. The results of these tracing experiments confirm the general notion of reciprocal connections between the <BrainRegion>subthalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>(STh) and <BrainRegion>pallidal areas</BrainRegion>. Thus the <BrainRegion>dorsomedial part of the subthalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>(STh) is connected with the <BrainRegion>subcommisural ventral pallidum</BrainRegion>, whereas a more <BrainRegion>ventral and lateral part of the medial subthalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>(STh) is related to the <BrainRegion>medial globus pallidus</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>lateral hypothalamic area</BrainRegion>, directly adjacent to the <BrainRegion>subthalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>(STh) , containing neurons with a morphology quite similar to those in the <BrainRegion>subthalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>(STh) , projects to parts of the <BrainRegion>ventral pallidum</BrainRegion> related to the <BrainRegion>olfactory tubercle</BrainRegion>. The reciprocal projection from this <BrainRegion>pallidal area</BrainRegion> to <BrainRegion>subthalamic regions</BrainRegion> appears to be very sparse. The <BrainRegion>medial subthalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>(STh) sends strong projections to the <BrainRegion>medial part of the entopeduncular nucleus</BrainRegion> and the adjacent <BrainRegion>lateral hypothalamic area</BrainRegion>. Sparser projections from the <BrainRegion>medial subthalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>(STh) reach the <BrainRegion>rostral and medial part of the caudate-putamen</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>nucleus accumbens</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>nucleus accumbens</BrainRegion> sends a very sparse projection back to the <BrainRegion>medial subthalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>(STh) . The projections of the <BrainRegion>medial subthalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>(STh) to the <BrainRegion>ventral mesencephalon</BrainRegion> appear also to be topographically organized. The <BrainRegion>lateral hypothalamus</BrainRegion> and a few cells in the most <BrainRegion>medial part of the subthalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>(STh) project to the <BrainRegion>ventral tegmental area</BrainRegion>, whereas progressively more <BrainRegion>lateral parts of the ventral mesencephalon</BrainRegion>, in particular the <BrainRegion>substantia nigra</BrainRegion>, receive input from successively more <BrainRegion>lateral and caudal parts of the subthalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>(STh) . In addition, a number of <BrainRegion>subthalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>(STh) fibers reach the midbrain <BrainRegion>extrapyramidal area</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>lateral part of the parafascicular thalamic nucleus</BrainRegion> projects to the <BrainRegion>lateral part of the subthalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>(STh) , whereas parafascicular neurons medial to the fasciculus retroflexus project to the <BrainRegion>dorsomedial portion of the subthalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>(STh) . The medial part of the <BrainRegion>subthalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>(STh) and the adjacent <BrainRegion>lateral hypothalamus</BrainRegion> are intimately connected with <BrainRegion>limbic parts of the basal ganglia</BrainRegion> in a way similar and parallel to the connections of the <BrainRegion>lateral subthalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>(STh) with <BrainRegion>motor-related parts of the basal ganglia</BrainRegion>. These findings suggest a role for the <BrainRegion>subthalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>(STh) in nonmotor functions of the <BrainRegion>basal ganglia</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Serotoninergic and noradrenergic projections to the <BrainRegion>ventral posterolateral nucleus</BrainRegion> of the monkey <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>In the present study, serotoninergic and noradrenergic varicosities were identified in the <BrainRegion>ventral posterolateral nucleus</BrainRegion> of the macaque monkey. Monoaminergic neurons projecting to the <BrainRegion>ventral posterolateral nucleus of the thalamus</BrainRegion> were identified by using retrograde labeling with horseradish peroxidase combined with immunocytochemical staining for serotonin or dopamine-beta-hydroxylase. The midbrain <BrainRegion>nucleus raphe dorsalis</BrainRegion> was the major site of origin for neurons providing a serotoninergic projection to the <BrainRegion>ventral posterolateral nucleus</BrainRegion>. A few retrogradely labeled serotonin-containing neurons were also observed in the <BrainRegion>central superior and the raphe pontis nuclei</BrainRegion>. Noradrenergic cells with projections to the <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion> were primarily located in the <BrainRegion>nucleus locus coeruleus</BrainRegion> with some projection neurons in the <BrainRegion>nucleus subcoeruleus</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>A5 catecholamine cell group of the pons</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Afferent and efferent connections of the <BrainRegion>medial preoptic area</BrainRegion> in the rat: a WGA-HRP study.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Afferent and efferent connections of the <BrainRegion>medial preoptic area</BrainRegion> including <BrainRegion>medial preoptic nucleus</BrainRegion> (MP) and <BrainRegion>periventricular area at the medial preoptic nucleus</BrainRegion>(MP) level were examined using WGA-HRP as a marker. Injections were performed by insertion of micropipette containing (1) small amount of HRP powder or (2) dryed HRP solution for 24 to 48 hr until the fixation or for 5 min respectively. Dorsal and ventral approaches of injection micropipettes were performed and the results were compared. Previously reported reciprocal connections with <BrainRegion>lateral septum</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>bed nucleus of the stria terminalis</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>medial amygdaloid nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>lateral hypothalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>arcuate nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>supramammillary nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>central gray at the mesencephalon</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>raphe dorsalis</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>raphe medianus</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>lateral parabrachial nucleus</BrainRegion> have been confirmed. In addition, we found reciprocal connections with <BrainRegion>septo-hypothalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>amygdalo-hipocampal nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>subiculum</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>parafascicular thalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>posterior thalamic nucleus at the caudo-ventral subdivision</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>median preoptic nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>lateral preoptic nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>anterior hypothalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>periventricular area at the caudal hypothalamic level</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>posterior hypothalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>dorsal and ventral premammillary nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>lateral mammillary nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>peripeduncular nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>periventricular gray</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>ventral tegmental area</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>interpeduncular nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>nucleus raphe pontis</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>nucleus raphe magnus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>pedunculo-pontine tegmental nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>gigantocellular reticular nucleus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>solitary tract nucleus</BrainRegion>. The areas which had only efferent connections from <BrainRegion>medial preoptic nucleus</BrainRegion>(MP) were <BrainRegion>accumbens</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>caudate putamen</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>ventral pallidum</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>substantia innominata</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>lateral habenular nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>paratenial thalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>paraventricular thalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>mediodorsal thalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>reuniens thalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>median eminence</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>medial mammillary nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>subthalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>pars compacta of substantia nigra</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>oculomotor nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>red nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>laterodorsal tegmental nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>reticular tegmental nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>cuneiform nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>nucleus locus coeruleus</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>dorsal motor nucleus of vagus</BrainRegion> among which <BrainRegion>substantia innominata</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>median eminence</BrainRegion> were previously reported. Efferent connections to the <BrainRegion>nucleus of Darkschewitsch</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>interstitial nucleus of Cajal</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>dorsal tegmental nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>ventral tegmental nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>vestibular nuclei</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>nucleus raphe obsculus</BrainRegion> were very weak or abscent in the ventral approach while they were observed in dorsal approach. Previously reported afferent connections from <BrainRegion>dorsal tegmental nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>cuneiform nucleus</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>nucleus locus ceruleus</BrainRegion> were not detected in this study.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Cortical projections of the <BrainRegion>parvocellular laminae C of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion> in the cat: an anterograde wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase study.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The areal and laminar distributions of the projection from the <BrainRegion>parvocellular part of laminae C of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion> (Cparv) were studied in <BrainRegion>visual cortical areas</BrainRegion> of the cat with the anterograde tracing method by using wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. A particular objective of this study was to examine the central visual pathways of the W-cell system, the precise organization of which is still unknown. Because the <BrainRegion>Cparv</BrainRegion> in the cat is said to receive W-cell information exclusively from the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion>, the results obtained would provide an anatomical substrate for the W-cell system organization in mammals. The results show that the cortical targets of the <BrainRegion>Cparv</BrainRegion> are <BrainRegion>areas 17</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>18</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>19</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>20a</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>21a</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>posteromedial lateral suprasylvian</BrainRegion> (PMLS) and <BrainRegion>ventral lateral suprasylvian</BrainRegion>(VLS) areas. In <BrainRegion>area 17</BrainRegion>, the projection fibers terminate in the superficial half of layer I; the lower two-thirds of layer III, extending to the superficial part of layer IV; and the deep part of layer IV, involving layer Va. These terminations form triple bands in <BrainRegion>area 17</BrainRegion>. The projection terminals in layer I are continuous, whereas those in layers III, IV, and Va distribute periodically, exhibiting a patchy appearance. In <BrainRegion>areas 18</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>19</BrainRegion>, the projection fibers terminate in the superficial half of layer I and in the full portions of layers III and IV, forming double bands. In these areas, the terminals in layer I are continuous, whereas those in layers III and IV distribute periodically, exhibiting a patchy appearance. In <BrainRegion>area 20a</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>area 21a</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>posteromedial lateral suprasylvian</BrainRegion>(PMLS) , and <BrainRegion>VLS</BrainRegion>, projection fibers terminate in the superficial part of layer I, in part of layer III, and in the full portion of layer IV, although they are far fewer in number than those seen in <BrainRegion>areas 17</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>18</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>19</BrainRegion>. The present results demonstrate that the <BrainRegion>Cparv</BrainRegion> fibers terminate in a localized fashion in both the <BrainRegion>striate and the extrastriate cortical areas</BrainRegion> and that these W-cell projections are quite unique in their areal and laminar organization compared with the X- and Y-cell systems.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Synaptology of the direct projections from the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion> to <BrainRegion>pharyngeal motoneurons in the nucleus ambiguus</BrainRegion> of the rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>During the pharyngeal phase of the swallowing reflex, the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion> (NTS) receives peripheral inputs from the pharynx by means of the <BrainRegion>glossopharyngeal ganglion</BrainRegion> and is the location of premotor neurons for the pharyngeal (PH) motoneurons. The semicompact formation of the <BrainRegion>nucleus ambiguus</BrainRegion> (AmS) is composed of small and medium-sized neurons that do not project to the pharynx, and large pharyngeal(PH) motoneurons. We investigated whether the neurons in the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion>(NTS) projected directly to the pharyngeal(PH) motoneurons or to the other kinds of neurons in the <BrainRegion>ambiguus</BrainRegion>(AmS) by using the electron microscope. When wheat germ agglutinin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) was injected into the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion>(NTS) after cholera toxin subunit B-conjugated HRP (CT-HRP) injections into the pharyngeal muscles of male Sprague-Dawley rats, many nerve terminals anterogradely labeled with wheat germ agglutinin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase(WGA-HRP) were found to contact pharyngeal(PH) motoneurons retrogradely labeled with B-conjugated HRP(CT-HRP) . Most of the labeled axodendritic terminals (63%) contained pleomorphic vesicles with symmetric synaptic contacts (Gray&apos;s type II), and the remaining ones contained round vesicles with asymmetric synaptic contacts (Gray's type I). About 14% of the axosomatic terminals on pharyngeal(PH) motoneuron in a sectional plane were anterogradely labeled, and about 70% of the labeled axosomatic terminals were Gray's type II. Observations of serial ultrathin sections revealed that both the small and the medium-sized neurons received only a few labeled axosomatic terminals that were exclusively Gray's type I. These results indicate that the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion>(NTS) neurons may send mainly inhibitory as well as a few excitatory inputs  directly to the <BrainRegion>pharyngeal(PH) motoneurons in the ambiguus</BrainRegion>(AmS) .</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>The region of the <BrainRegion>pontine parabrachial nucleus</BrainRegion> is a major target of dehydration-sensitive CRH neurons in the rat <BrainRegion>lateral hypothalamic area</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Neurons in a restricted part of the <BrainRegion>lateral hypothalamic area</BrainRegion> (LHA) show increased expression of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) mRNA as a consequence of cellular dehydration. In the present study, we have investigated the organization of their efferent projections by using anterograde and retrograde tracing techniques. Additionally, we have compared the distribution of corticotropin-releasing hormone(CRH) mRNA-containing neurons after cellular dehydration and intraventricular (i.c.v.) colchicine injections. Our results show that cellular dehydration activates a more restricted neuronal population than does i.c.v. colchicine. Iontophoretic injections of Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PHAL) were placed in the <BrainRegion>lateral hypothalamic area</BrainRegion>(LHA) of animals drinking hypertonic saline and their proximity to activated corticotropin-releasing hormone(CRH) neurons determined by in situ hybridization for corticotropin-releasing hormone(CRH) mRNA. Although labelled fibers from these injections were seen throughout the brain, the region of the <BrainRegion>parabrachial nucleus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion> (NTS) were most conspicuous in also having corticotropin-releasing hormone(CRH) immunoreactive fibers. Injections of Fluoro-Gold placed in these two structures were used to confirm these findings in dehydrated animals. Significant numbers of neurons containing both Fluoro-Gold and corticotropin-releasing hormone(CRH) mRNA were seen in the <BrainRegion>lateral hypothalamus</BrainRegion> after injections in the <BrainRegion>lateral and medial parts of the parabrachial nucleus</BrainRegion>; far fewer were seen after injections in the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion>(NTS) . These results strongly suggest that the <BrainRegion>corticotropin-releasing hormone(CRH) neurons in the lateral hypothalamic area</BrainRegion>(LHA) activated by cellular dehydration provide an input to the region of the <BrainRegion>parabrachial nucleus</BrainRegion>. The altered biochemical composition of this pathway may well be able to modify sensory and motor patterns both during and after dehydration.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Striatal and central extended <BrainRegion>amygdala</BrainRegion> parts of the <BrainRegion>interstitial nucleus of the posterior limb of the anterior commissure</BrainRegion>: evidence from tract-tracing techniques in the rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The <BrainRegion>interstitial nucleus of the posterior limb of the anterior commissure</BrainRegion> (IPAC) lies at the junction of the striatopallidal system and the <BrainRegion>lateral bed nucleus of the stria terminalis-central amygdaloid nucleus continuum</BrainRegion> (i.e., the <BrainRegion>central extended amygdala</BrainRegion>; EAc). Its efferent connections were investigated in the rat with anterograde (Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin) and retrograde (Fluoro-Gold and cholera toxin B subunit) tracers and compared with those of the <BrainRegion>central amygdaloid nucleus</BrainRegion>. Our anterograde tracing experiments reveal that the projections of the <BrainRegion>medial IPAC</BrainRegion> largely reciprocate its afferent connections (Shammah-Lagnado et al. [1999] Neuroscience 94:1097-1123) and are very similar to those of the <BrainRegion>medial part of the central amygdaloid nucleus</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>lateral IPAC</BrainRegion>, on the other hand, innervates the <BrainRegion>pallidal complex</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>substantia nigra</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>retrorubral field</BrainRegion>. Local connections are found within <BrainRegion>medial IPAC</BrainRegion> and within <BrainRegion>lateral IPAC</BrainRegion>, but the two divisions are not interconnected. Our retrograde tracing experiments confirm that <BrainRegion>IPAC</BrainRegion> projections to <BrainRegion>EAc</BrainRegion> components, <BrainRegion>parabrachial area</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion> originate chiefly from the medial division, whereas both medial and lateral divisions innervate the <BrainRegion>retrorubral field</BrainRegion>. Moreover, in sections processed for choline acetyltransferase, the strong projections from <BrainRegion>caudal IPACm</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>posterior basolateral amygdaloid nucleus</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>amygdalopiriform transition area</BrainRegion> were found to arise chiefly from cholinergic cells. Overall, our results suggest that the <BrainRegion>medial IPAC</BrainRegion> is intimately related to the <BrainRegion>EAc</BrainRegion>, whereas the <BrainRegion>lateral IPAC</BrainRegion> represents a striatal territory.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Efferent <BrainRegion>subcortical</BrainRegion> projections of the <BrainRegion>laryngeal motorcortex</BrainRegion> in the rhesus monkey.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>In order to better understand the descending voluntary vocal control pathway, the efferent subcortical projections of the <BrainRegion>laryngeal motorcortex</BrainRegion> were studied in the rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta). For this purpose, the <BrainRegion>left motorcortex</BrainRegion> was exposed in three animals under narcosis. By electrical brain stimulation, sites were identified yielding vocal fold adduction. Effective sites were injected with the anterograde tracer biotin dextran amine. Subcortical projections could be traced within the <BrainRegion>forebrain</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>putamen</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>caudate nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>claustrum</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>zona incerta</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>field H of Forel</BrainRegion> and a number of <BrainRegion>thalamic nuclei</BrainRegion>, with the heaviest projections to the <BrainRegion>nuclei ventralis lateralis</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>ventralis posteromedialis</BrainRegion>, including its <BrainRegion>parvocellular part</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>medialis dorsalis</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>centralis medialis</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>centrum medianum</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>reuniens</BrainRegion>. In the <BrainRegion>midbrain</BrainRegion>, labeling was found in the <BrainRegion>deep mesencephalic nucleus</BrainRegion>. In the <BrainRegion>lower brainstem</BrainRegion>, fibers terminated in the <BrainRegion>pontine</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>medullary reticular formation</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>locus coeruleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>nucleus subcoeruleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>medial parabrachial nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>nucleus of the spinal trigeminal tract</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>solitary tract nucleus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>facial nucleus</BrainRegion>. No projections were found to the <BrainRegion>nucl. ambiguus</BrainRegion>. The fact that monkeys, in contrast to humans, lack a direct connection of the <BrainRegion>motorcortex</BrainRegion> with the <BrainRegion>laryngeal motoneurons</BrainRegion> suggests that this connection has evolved in the last few million years and might represent one of the factors that made speech evolution possible.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Amygdaloid</BrainRegion> inputs define a caudal component of the <BrainRegion>ventral striatum</BrainRegion> in primates.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The <BrainRegion>ventral striatum</BrainRegion> mediates goal-directed behavior through <BrainRegion>limbic</BrainRegion> afferents. One well-established afferent to the <BrainRegion>ventral striatum</BrainRegion> is the <BrainRegion>amygdaloid complex</BrainRegion>, which projects throughout the shell and core of the <BrainRegion>nucleus accumbens</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>rostral ventromedial caudate nucleus</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>rostral ventromedial putamen</BrainRegion>. However, <BrainRegion>striatal regions caudal to the anterior commissure</BrainRegion> also receive inputs from the <BrainRegion>amygdala</BrainRegion>. These caudal areas contain histochemical and cytoarchitectural features that resemble the shell and core, based on our recent studies. Specifically, there is a calcium binding protein (CaBP)-poor region in the <BrainRegion>lateral amygdalostriatal area</BrainRegion> that resembles the &quot;shell." To examine the idea that the <BrainRegion>caudal ventral striatum</BrainRegion> is part of the &quot;classic" <BrainRegion>ventral striatum</BrainRegion>, we placed small injections of retrograde tracers throughout the <BrainRegion>caudal ventral striatum/amygdalostriatal area</BrainRegion> and charted the distribution of specific <BrainRegion>amygdaloid</BrainRegion> inputs. <BrainRegion>Amygdaloid</BrainRegion> inputs to the calcium binding protein(CaBP) -poor zone in the <BrainRegion>lateral amygdalostriatal area</BrainRegion> arise from the <BrainRegion>basal nucleus</BrainRegion>, the magnocellular subdivision of the <BrainRegion>accessory basal nucleus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>periamygdaloid cortex</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>medial subdivision of the central nucleus</BrainRegion>, resembling that of the shell of the <BrainRegion>ventral striatum</BrainRegion> found in our previous studies. There are also <BrainRegion>amygdaloid</BrainRegion> inputs to calcium binding protein(CaBP) -positive areas outside the shell, which originate mainly in the <BrainRegion>basal nucleus</BrainRegion>. Taken together, the <BrainRegion>&quot;limbic-related" striatum</BrainRegion> forms a continuum from the <BrainRegion>rostral ventral striatum</BrainRegion> through the <BrainRegion>caudal ventral striatum/lateral amygdalostriatal area</BrainRegion> based on histochemical and cellular similarities, as well as inputs from the <BrainRegion>amygdala</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Role of the <BrainRegion>central nucleus of the amygdala</BrainRegion> in the control of blood pressure: descending pathways to <BrainRegion>medullary cardiovascular nuclei</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>1. One of the key areas that links psychologically induced stress with the blood pressure-regulatory system is the <BrainRegion>central nucleus of the amygdala</BrainRegion> (CeA). This is an integratory <BrainRegion>forebrain nucleus</BrainRegion> that receives input from higher centres in the <BrainRegion>forebrain</BrainRegion> and has extensive connections with the <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>medulla oblongata</BrainRegion>, areas involved in the regulation of the cardiovascular reflexes. 2. Based on studies using electrical or chemical stimulation or electrolytic lesions of the <BrainRegion>CeA</BrainRegion>, it has become clear that the <BrainRegion>CeA</BrainRegion> plays an important role in the regulation of blood pressure in response to stressful or fearful stimuli. 3. Two important <BrainRegion>medullary areas</BrainRegion> known to receive projections from the <BrainRegion>CeA</BrainRegion> are the <BrainRegion>nucleus tractus solitarius</BrainRegion> (NTS) and the <BrainRegion>rostral ventrolateral medulla</BrainRegion> (RVLM). The <BrainRegion>NTS</BrainRegion> is the site of the first synapse for afferent fibres originating from baroreceptors, chemoreceptors and the heart, whereas the <BrainRegion>RVLM</BrainRegion> contains neurons that maintain resting blood pressure and sympathetic nerve activity via projections to sympathetic preganglionic neurons in the <BrainRegion>intermediolateral cell column of the thoracolumbar spinal cord</BrainRegion>. 4. Electron microscopic studies using combined anterograde tracing and pre- and post-embedding immunogold labelling have shown that the pathways originating from the <BrainRegion>CeA</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>NTS</BrainRegion> are inhibitory and may use GABA as a neurotransmitter. The results of these studies suggest that blood pressure changes produced by activation of the <BrainRegion>CeA</BrainRegion> may be mediated by attenuation of baroreceptor reflexes through a GABAergic mechanism at the level of the <BrainRegion>NTS</BrainRegion>. 5. Neuronal tract tracing combined with neurofunctional studies using the Fos protein as a marker of activated neurons indicate that the <BrainRegion>CeA</BrainRegion> projects directly to baroreceptive neurons in the <BrainRegion>NTS</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>RVLM</BrainRegion> that are activated by changes in blood pressure. 6. In conclusion, studies that have examined the efferent pathways of the <BrainRegion>CeA</BrainRegion> suggest that <BrainRegion>CeA</BrainRegion> neurons with projections to medullary baroreceptive neurons may play a vital role in the reflex changes in sympathetic nerve activity that are involved in blood pressure regulation in response to stress or anxiety.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Descending projections of the hamster <BrainRegion>intergeniculate leaflet</BrainRegion>: relationship to the sleep/arousal and visuomotor systems.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The <BrainRegion>intergeniculate leaflet</BrainRegion> (IGL), homolog of the primate <BrainRegion>pregeniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>, modulates circadian rhythms. However, its extensive anatomical connections suggest that it may regulate other systems, particularly those for visuomotor function and sleep/arousal. Here, <BrainRegion>descending intergeniculate leaflet</BrainRegion>(IGL) -efferent pathways are identified with the anterograde tracer, Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin, with projections to over 50 <BrainRegion>brain stem nuclei</BrainRegion>. Projections of the <BrainRegion>ventral lateral geniculate</BrainRegion> are similar, but more limited. Many of the nuclei with <BrainRegion>intergeniculate leaflet</BrainRegion>(IGL) afferents contribute to circuitry governing visuomotor function. These include the <BrainRegion>oculomotor</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>trochlear</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>anterior pretectal</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>Edinger-Westphal</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>terminal nuclei</BrainRegion>; all layers of the <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>supraoculomotor periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>nucleus of the optic tract</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>inferior olive</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>raphe interpositus</BrainRegion>. Other target nuclei are known to be involved in the regulation of sleep, including the <BrainRegion>lateral dorsal and pedunculopontine tegmentum</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>dorsal raphe</BrainRegion> also receives projections from the <BrainRegion>intergeniculate leaflet</BrainRegion>(IGL) and may contribute to both sleep/arousal and visuomotor function. However, the <BrainRegion>locus coeruleus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>medial vestibular nucleus</BrainRegion>, which contribute to sleep and eye movement regulation and which send projections to the <BrainRegion>intergeniculate leaflet</BrainRegion>(IGL) , do not receive reciprocal projections from it. The potential involvement of the <BrainRegion>intergeniculate leaflet</BrainRegion>(IGL) with the sleep/arousal system is further buttressed by existing evidence showing <BrainRegion>intergeniculate leaflet</BrainRegion>(IGL) -efferent projections to the <BrainRegion>ventrolateral preoptic area</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>dorsomedial</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>medial tuberal hypothalamus</BrainRegion>. In addition, the great majority of all regions receiving <BrainRegion>intergeniculate leaflet</BrainRegion>(IGL) projections also receive input from the orexin/hypocretin system, suggesting that this system contributes not only to the regulation of sleep, but to eye movement control as well.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Medial vestibular</BrainRegion> connections with the hypocretin (orexin) system.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The mammalian <BrainRegion>medial vestibular nucleus</BrainRegion> (MVe) receives input from all <BrainRegion>vestibular endorgans</BrainRegion> and provides extensive projections to the central nervous system. Recent studies have demonstrated projections from the <BrainRegion>medial vestibular nucleus</BrainRegion>(MVe) to the circadian rhythm system. In addition, there are known projections from the <BrainRegion>medial vestibular nucleus</BrainRegion>(MVe) to regions considered to be involved in sleep and arousal. In this study, afferent and efferent subcortical connectivity of the <BrainRegion>medial vestibular nucleus</BrainRegion> of the golden hamster (Mesocricetus auratus) was evaluated using cholera toxin subunit-B (retrograde), Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (anterograde), and pseudorabies virus (transneuronal retrograde) tract-tracing techniques. The results demonstrate <BrainRegion>medial vestibular nucleus</BrainRegion>(MVe) connections with regions mediating visuomotor and postural control, as previously observed in other mammals. The data also identify extensive projections from the <BrainRegion>medial vestibular nucleus</BrainRegion>(MVe) to regions mediating arousal and sleep-related functions, most of which receive immunohistochemically identified projections from the lateral hypothalamic hypocretin (orexin) neurons. These include the <BrainRegion>locus coeruleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>dorsal and pedunculopontine tegmental nuclei</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>dorsal raphe</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>lateral preoptic area</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>medial vestibular nucleus</BrainRegion>(MVe) itself receives a projection from hypocretin cells. CTB tracing demonstrated reciprocal connections between the <BrainRegion>medial vestibular nucleus</BrainRegion>(MVe) and most brain areas receiving <BrainRegion>medial vestibular nucleus</BrainRegion>(MVe) efferents. Virus tracing confirmed and extended the <BrainRegion>medial vestibular nucleus</BrainRegion>(MVe) afferent connections identified with CTB and additionally demonstrated transneuronal connectivity with the <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>medial habenular nucleus</BrainRegion>. These anatomical data indicate that the vestibular system has access to a broad array of neural functions not typically associated with visuomotor, balance, or equilibrium, and that the <BrainRegion>medial vestibular nucleus</BrainRegion>(MVe) is likely to receive information from many of the same regions to which it projects.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion> in the rat: projections to <BrainRegion>subcortical autonomic, motor, and limbic centers</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>This paper describes the quantitative areal and laminar distribution of identified neuron populations projecting from areas of <BrainRegion>prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion> (PFC) to <BrainRegion>subcortical autonomic, motor, and limbic sites</BrainRegion> in the rat. Injections of the retrograde pathway tracer wheat germ agglutinin conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) were made into <BrainRegion>dorsal/ventral striatum</BrainRegion> (DS/VS), <BrainRegion>basolateral amygdala</BrainRegion> (BLA), <BrainRegion>mediodorsal thalamus</BrainRegion> (MD), <BrainRegion>lateral hypothalamus</BrainRegion> (LH), <BrainRegion>mediolateral septum</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>dorsolateral periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>dorsal raphe</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>ventral tegmental area</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>parabrachial nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>nucleus tractus solitarius</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>rostral/caudal ventrolateral medulla</BrainRegion>, or <BrainRegion>thoracic spinal cord</BrainRegion> (SC). High-resolution flat-map density distributions of retrogradely labelled neurons indicated that specific <BrainRegion>prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion>(PFC) regions were differentially involved in the projections studied, with <BrainRegion>medial (m) prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion>(PFC) divided into dorsal and ventral sectors. The percentages that wheat germ agglutinin conjugated with horseradish peroxidase(WGA-HRP) retrogradely labelled neurons composed of the projection neurons in individual layers of infralimbic (IL; <BrainRegion>area 25</BrainRegion>) <BrainRegion>prelimbic</BrainRegion> (PL; <BrainRegion>area 32</BrainRegion>), and <BrainRegion>dorsal anterior cingulate</BrainRegion> (ACd; <BrainRegion>area 24b</BrainRegion>) cortices were calculated. Among layer 5 pyramidal cells, approximately 27.4% in infralimbic(IL) / <BrainRegion>prelimbic</BrainRegion>(PL) /<BrainRegion>ACd</BrainRegion> <BrainRegion>cortices</BrainRegion> projected to <BrainRegion>lateral hypothalamus</BrainRegion>(LH) , 22.9% in infralimbic(IL) /<BrainRegion>ventral prelimbic</BrainRegion>(PL) to <BrainRegion>VS</BrainRegion>, 18.3% in <BrainRegion>ACd</BrainRegion>/<BrainRegion>dorsal prelimbic</BrainRegion>(PL) to <BrainRegion>DS</BrainRegion>, and 8.1% in areas infralimbic(IL) / <BrainRegion>prelimbic</BrainRegion>(PL) to <BrainRegion>basolateral amygdala</BrainRegion>(BLA) ; and 37% of layer 6 pyramidal cells in infralimbic(IL) / <BrainRegion>prelimbic</BrainRegion>(PL) /<BrainRegion>ACd</BrainRegion> projected to <BrainRegion>mediodorsal thalamus</BrainRegion>(MD) . Data for other projection pathways are given. Multiple dual retrograde fluorescent tracing studies indicated that moderate populations (&amp;lt;9%) of layer 5 m <BrainRegion>prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion>(PFC) neurons projected to <BrainRegion>lateral hypothalamus</BrainRegion>(LH) /<BrainRegion>VS</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>lateral hypothalamus</BrainRegion>(LH) / <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>(SC) , or <BrainRegion>VS</BrainRegion>/ <BrainRegion>basolateral amygdala</BrainRegion>(BLA) . The data provide new quantitative information concerning the density and distribution of neurons involved in identified projection pathways from defined areas of the rat <BrainRegion>prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion>(PFC) to specific subcortical targets involved in dynamic goal-directed behavior.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>The <BrainRegion>pretectum</BrainRegion>: connections and oculomotor-related roles.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Research over the past two decades in mammals, especially primates, has greatly improved our understanding of the afferent and efferent connections of two <BrainRegion>retinorecipient pretectal nuclei</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the optic tract</BrainRegion> (NOT) and the <BrainRegion>pretectal olivary nucleus</BrainRegion> (PON). Functional studies of these two nuclei have further elucidated some of the roles that they play both in oculomotor control and in relaying oculomotor-related signals to <BrainRegion>visual relay nuclei</BrainRegion>. Therefore, following a brief overview of the anatomy and <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> projections to the entire mammalian <BrainRegion>pretectum</BrainRegion>, the connections and potential roles of the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the optic tract</BrainRegion>(NOT) and the <BrainRegion>pretectal olivary nucleus</BrainRegion>(PON) are considered in detail. Data on the specific connections of the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the optic tract</BrainRegion>(NOT) are combined with data from single-unit recording, microstimulation, and lesion studies to show that this nucleus plays critical roles in optokinetic nystagmus, short-latency ocular following, smooth pursuit eye movements, and adaptation of the gain of the horizontal vestibulo-ocular reflex. Comparable data for the <BrainRegion>pretectal olivary nucleus</BrainRegion>(PON) show that this nucleus plays critical roles in the pupillary light reflex, light-evoked blinks, rapid eye movement sleep triggering, and modulating <BrainRegion>subcortical nuclei</BrainRegion> involved in circadian rhythms.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Single-axon tracing study of corticostriatal projections arising from <BrainRegion>primary motor cortex</BrainRegion> in primates.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The axonal projections arising from the <BrainRegion>forelimb area of the primary motor cortex</BrainRegion> (M1) in cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) were studied following microiontophoretic injections of biotinylated dextran amine under electrophysiological guidance. The microinjections were centered on layer V, and 42 anterogradely labeled corticofugal axons were reconstructed from serial frontal or sagittal sections with a camera lucida. Our investigation shows that the primate <BrainRegion>striatum</BrainRegion> receives both direct and indirect projections from <BrainRegion>M1</BrainRegion>. The direct corticostriatal projection is formed by axons that remain uniformly thin and unbranched throughout their sinuous trajectory to the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral striatum</BrainRegion>. They divide as they enter the <BrainRegion>dorsolateral sector of the post-commissural putamen</BrainRegion>, the so-called <BrainRegion>sensorimotor striatal territory</BrainRegion>. The indirect corticostriatal projection derives from a thin collateral emitted within the <BrainRegion>corona radiata</BrainRegion> by thick, long-range fibers that descend toward the <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion>. The collateral enters the <BrainRegion>putamen</BrainRegion> dorsomedially and remains unbranched until it reaches the <BrainRegion>dorsolateral sector of the putamen</BrainRegion>, where it breaks out into two to four axonal branches displaying small and equally spaced varicosities. Both direct and indirect corticostriatal axons branch moderately but occupy vast <BrainRegion>rostrocaudal striatal territories</BrainRegion>, where they appear to contact en passant several widely distributed <BrainRegion>striatal</BrainRegion> neurons. These findings reveal that, in contrast to current beliefs, the primate motor corticostriatal system is not exclusively formed by axons dedicated solely to the <BrainRegion>striatum</BrainRegion>. It also comprises collaterals from long-range corticofugal axons, which can thus provide to the <BrainRegion>striatum</BrainRegion> a copy of the neural information that is being conveyed to the <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion> and/or <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Aldosterone-sensitive neurons in the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion>: efferent projections.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The <BrainRegion>nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion> (NTS) contains a subpopulation of neurons that express the enzyme 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (HSD2), which makes them uniquely sensitive to aldosterone. These neurons may drive sodium appetite, which is enhanced by aldosterone. Anterograde and retrograde neural tracing techniques were used to reveal the efferent projections of the 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2(HSD2) neurons in the rat. First, the anterograde tracer Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin was used to label axonal projections from the <BrainRegion>medial nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion>(NTS) . Then, <BrainRegion>nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion>(NTS) -innervated brain regions were injected with a retrograde tracer, cholera toxin beta subunit, to determine which sites are innervated by the 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2(HSD2) neurons. The 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2(HSD2) neurons project mainly to the <BrainRegion>ventrolateral bed nucleus of the stria terminalis</BrainRegion> (BSTvl), the <BrainRegion>pre-locus coeruleus</BrainRegion> (pre-LC), and the inner division of the <BrainRegion>external lateral parabrachial nucleus</BrainRegion> (PBel). They also send minor axonal projections to the midbrain <BrainRegion>ventral tegmental area</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>lateral and paraventricular hypothalamic nuclei</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>central nucleus of the amygdala</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>periaqueductal gray matter</BrainRegion>. The 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2(HSD2) neurons do not innervate the <BrainRegion>ventrolateral medulla</BrainRegion>, a key <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion> autonomic site. Additionally, our tracing experiments confirmed that the <BrainRegion>BSTvl</BrainRegion> receives direct axonal projections from the neighboring A2 noradrenergic neurons in the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion>(NTS) , and from the same <BrainRegion>pontine</BrainRegion> sites that receive major inputs from the 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2(HSD2) neurons (<BrainRegion>PBel</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>pre-locus coeruleus</BrainRegion>(pre-LC) ). The efferent projections of the 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2(HSD2) neurons may provide new insights into the brain circuitry responsible for sodium appetite.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Ultrastructural organization of <BrainRegion>medial prefrontal</BrainRegion> inputs to the <BrainRegion>rhinal cortices</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Accumulating evidence suggests that the <BrainRegion>medial prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion> (mPFC) plays a critical role in the formation, retrieval and long-term storage of hippocampal-dependent memories. Consistent with this, there are direct <BrainRegion>hippocampal</BrainRegion> projections to the <BrainRegion>medial prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion>(mPFC) . Moreover, the <BrainRegion>medial prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion>(mPFC) sends robust projections to the <BrainRegion>perirhinal</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>entorhinal cortices</BrainRegion>, two interconnected cortical fields that funnel information into and out of the <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion>. However, the significance of the latter projection remains unclear because no data are available regarding the <BrainRegion>rhinal</BrainRegion> targets of <BrainRegion>medial prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion>(mPFC) axons. This question was examined in the present study using a combination of anterograde tracing with Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin and pre-embedding gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) immunocytochemistry in guinea pigs. Following Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin injections in the <BrainRegion>medial prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion>(mPFC) , anterogradely labeled axons were seen in the <BrainRegion>perirhinal</BrainRegion> (mainly superficial layers) and <BrainRegion>lateral entorhinal</BrainRegion> (mainly deep layers) cortices. In the electron microscope, the synaptic articulation of anterogradely labeled <BrainRegion>medial prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion>(mPFC) axon terminals with <BrainRegion>perirhinal</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>entorhinal</BrainRegion> neurons was found to be nearly identical. In these two <BrainRegion>rhinal fields</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>medial prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion>(mPFC) axon terminals only formed asymmetric synapses, typically with gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) -immunonegative spines ( approximately 70%) but occasionally with dendritic profiles ( approximately 30%), half of which were gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) immunopositive. In the light of earlier observations, these findings indicate that <BrainRegion>medial prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion>(mPFC) inputs exert mainly excitatory effects in the <BrainRegion>rhinal cortices</BrainRegion>, prevalently on principal neurons. Thus, these results suggest that the <BrainRegion>medial prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion>(mPFC) may affect hippocampal-dependent memories by enhancing impulse traffic into and out of the <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion> at the level of the <BrainRegion>rhinal cortices</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Relationship of presympathetic-premotor neurons to the serotonergic transmitter system in the rat <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Numerous physiological conditions and emotionally motivated behaviors require concomitant activation of somatomotor and sympathetic efferents. Using a virally mediated retrograde transsynaptic tract-tracing approach, we have previously determined locations of presympathetic-premotor neurons (PSPMNs) in the rat <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion>. These putative dual-function neurons send projections to somatomotor and sympathetic targets and likely participate in sympatho-somatomotor integration. A significant portion of these neurons is found within <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion> areas known to contain serotonergic neurons. Thus, we hypothesized that some of the presympathetic-premotor neurons(PSPMNs) utilize serotonin as their neurotransmitter. To test this hypothesis we first produced an antibody against TPH2, a brain-specific isoform of tryptophan hydroxylase (serotonin synthetic enzyme). We identified presympathetic-premotor neurons(PSPMNs) by using recombinant strains of the pseudorabies virus (PRV) for transsynaptic tract-tracing. pseudorabies virus(PRV) -152, a strain that expresses enhanced green fluorescent protein, was injected into sympathectomized gastrocnemius muscle, while pseudorabies virus(PRV) -BaBlu, which expresses beta-galactosidase, was injected into the <BrainRegion>adrenal gland</BrainRegion> in the same animals. Using immunofluorescent methods we determined whether coinfected neurons expressed TPH2. Our findings demonstrate that TPH2-positive presympathetic-premotor neurons(PSPMNs) are present at different <BrainRegion>rostrocaudal levels of the brainstem</BrainRegion>. Just over half of them are found at the <BrainRegion>pontomedullary junction</BrainRegion> within <BrainRegion>raphe obscurus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>raphe magnus</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>gigantocellular nucleus pars alpha</BrainRegion>. These cells may play a role in mediating responses to acute pain stimuli and/or participate in the central control of exercise. Overactivity of these serotonergic sympatho-somatomotor circuits may also play a role in the pathophysiology of serotonin syndrome.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Task-guided selection of the dual neural pathways for reading.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The visual perception of words is known to activate the auditory representation of their spoken forms automatically. We examined the neural mechanism for this phonological activation using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with a masked priming paradigm. The stimulation sites (<BrainRegion>left superior temporal gyrus</BrainRegion> [L-STG] and <BrainRegion>inferior parietal lobe</BrainRegion> [L-IPL]), modality of targets (visual and auditory), and task (pronunciation and lexical decision) were manipulated independently. For both within- and cross-modal conditions, the repetition priming during pronunciation was eliminated when transcranial magnetic stimulation(TMS) was applied to the <BrainRegion>L-IPL</BrainRegion>, but not when applied to the <BrainRegion>L-STG</BrainRegion>, whereas the priming during lexical decision was eliminated when the <BrainRegion>L-STG</BrainRegion>, but not the <BrainRegion>L-IPL</BrainRegion>, was stimulated. The observed double dissociation suggests that the conscious task instruction modulates the stimulus-driven activation of the <BrainRegion>lateral temporal cortex</BrainRegion> for lexico-phonological activation and the <BrainRegion>inferior parietal cortex</BrainRegion> for spoken word production, and thereby engages a different neural network for generating the appropriate behavioral response.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Top-down control of <BrainRegion>motor cortex</BrainRegion> ensembles by <BrainRegion>dorsomedial prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText><BrainRegion>Dorsomedial prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion> is critical for the temporal control of behavior. <BrainRegion>Dorsomedial prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion> might alter neuronal activity in areas such as <BrainRegion>motor cortex</BrainRegion> to inhibit temporally inappropriate responses. We tested this hypothesis by recording from neuronal ensembles in rodent <BrainRegion>dorsomedial prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion> during a delayed-response task. One-third of <BrainRegion>dorsomedial prefrontal</BrainRegion> neurons were significantly modulated during the delay period. The activity of many of these neurons was predictive of premature responding. We then reversibly inactivated <BrainRegion>dorsomedial prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion> while recording ensemble activity in <BrainRegion>motor cortex</BrainRegion>. Inactivation of <BrainRegion>dorsomedial prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion> reduced delay-related firing, but not response-related firing, in <BrainRegion>motor cortex</BrainRegion>. Finally, we made simultaneous recordings in <BrainRegion>dorsomedial prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>motor cortex</BrainRegion> and found strong delay-related temporal correlations between neurons in the two <BrainRegion>cortical areas</BrainRegion>. These data suggest that functional interactions between <BrainRegion>dorsomedial prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>motor cortex</BrainRegion> might serve as a top-down control signal that inhibits inappropriate responding.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Premotor</BrainRegion> circuits controlling eyelid movements in conjunction with vertical saccades in the cat: II. <BrainRegion>interstitial nucleus of Cajal</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Vertical saccadic eye movements are accompanied by concurrent eyelid movements in the same direction. The <BrainRegion>interstitial nucleus of Cajal</BrainRegion> (InC) controls eye position for vertical eye movements and may also control saccade-related lid position as well. This study investigates whether the <BrainRegion>interstitial nucleus of Cajal</BrainRegion>(InC) serves as a premotor center for eyelid saccades, by employing dual-tracer methods in cats to label both the projections of the <BrainRegion>interstitial nucleus of Cajal</BrainRegion>(InC) and the motoneurons supplying the <BrainRegion>levator palpebrae superioris</BrainRegion> (LPS) muscle, which lie in the <BrainRegion>caudal central subdivision</BrainRegion> (CCS) of the <BrainRegion>oculomotor complex</BrainRegion>. Injections of biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) into the <BrainRegion>interstitial nucleus of Cajal</BrainRegion>(InC) anterogradely labeled axons that terminated bilaterally throughout the <BrainRegion>caudal central subdivision</BrainRegion>(CCS) and in the <BrainRegion>oculomotor nuclei proper</BrainRegion>. Labeled terminals lay in close association with labeled <BrainRegion>levator palpebrae superioris</BrainRegion>(LPS) motoneurons, which were retrogradely labeled following injections of wheat germ agglutinin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) into the muscle. Ultrastructural investigation revealed that most terminals contained spherical vesicles and formed asymmetric synaptic contacts with the labeled motoneurons. These results strongly suggest that the <BrainRegion>interstitial nucleus of Cajal</BrainRegion>(InC) monosynaptically controls lid movements in conjunction with vertical eye movements, including saccades. To identify the neurons of origin for this pathway, wheat germ agglutinin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase(WGA-HRP) injections were centered in the <BrainRegion>caudal central subdivision</BrainRegion>(CCS) . These experiments indicate that lid and eye motoneurons may share a common source of <BrainRegion>bilateral interstitial nucleus of Cajal</BrainRegion>(InC) input. Thus, a common vertical position signal may be employed to maintain the lid and eye at appropriate elevations during fixation, such that the lid sits just above the <BrainRegion>pupil</BrainRegion>, allowing unobstructed vision, but at the ready to protect the cornea.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Localization and comparative analysis of acid-sensing ion channel (ASIC1, 2, and 3) mRNA expression in mouse colonic sensory neurons within <BrainRegion>thoracolumbar dorsal root ganglia</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Reducing colonic mechanosensitivity is an important potential strategy for reducing visceral pain. Mice lacking acid-sensing ion channels (ASIC) 1, 2, and 3 show altered colonic mechanosensory function, implicating acid-sensing ion channels(ASIC) s in the mechanotransduction process. Deletion of acid-sensing ion channels(ASIC) s affects mechanotransduction in visceral and cutaneous afferents differently, suggesting differential expression. We determined relative expression of acid-sensing ion channels(ASIC) 1, 2, and 3 in mouse <BrainRegion>thoracolumbar dorsal root ganglia</BrainRegion> (DRG) by quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis (QPCR) and specifically in retrogradely traced colonic neurons isolated via laser capture microdissection. Localization of acid-sensing ion channels(ASIC) expression in <BrainRegion>dorsal root ganglia</BrainRegion>(DRG) was determined with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and retrograde tracing. QPCR of whole <BrainRegion>thoracolumbar dorsal root ganglia</BrainRegion>(DRG) revealed and abundance of acid-sensing ion channels(ASIC) 2 &amp;gt; acid-sensing ion channels(ASIC) 1 &gt; acid-sensing ion channels(ASIC) 3. Similarly, fluorescence in situ hybridization(FISH) of all neurons in <BrainRegion>thoracolumbar dorsal root ganglia</BrainRegion>(DRG) demonstrated that acid-sensing ion channels(ASIC) 2 was expressed in the most (40 +/- 1%) neurons, followed by acid-sensing ion channels(ASIC) 3 (24 +/- 1%), then acid-sensing ion channels(ASIC) 1 (18 +/- 1%). Retrograde tracing from the distal colon labeled 4 +/- 1% of neurons in <BrainRegion>T10-L1 dorsal root ganglia</BrainRegion>(DRG) . In contrast to whole <BrainRegion>dorsal root ganglia</BrainRegion>(DRG) , fluorescence in situ hybridization(FISH) of colonic neurons showed acid-sensing ion channels(ASIC) 3 expression in 73 +/- 2%, acid-sensing ion channels(ASIC) 2 in 47 +/- 0.5%, and acid-sensing ion channels(ASIC) 1 in 30 +/- 2%. QPCR of laser captured colonic neurons revealed that acid-sensing ion channels(ASIC) 3 was the most abundant acid-sensing ion channels(ASIC) transcript, followed by acid-sensing ion channels(ASIC) 1, then acid-sensing ion channels(ASIC) 2. We conclude that acid-sensing ion channels(ASIC) 1, 2, and 3 are expressed preferentially in colonic neurons within <BrainRegion>thoracolumbar dorsal root ganglia</BrainRegion>(DRG) . In particular acid-sensing ion channels(ASIC) 3, the least abundant in the general population, is the most abundant acid-sensing ion channels(ASIC) transcript in colonic neurons. The prevalence of acid-sensing ion channels(ASIC) 3 in neurons innervating the colon supports electrophysiological data showing that it makes a major contribution to colonic mechanotransduction and therefore may be a target for the treatment of visceral pain.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Responses of <BrainRegion>trigeminal ganglion</BrainRegion> neurons during natural whisking behaviors in the awake rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Rats use their whiskers to locate and discriminate tactile features of their environment. Mechanoreceptors surrounding each whisker encode and transmit sensory information from the environment to the brain via afferents whose cell bodies lie in the <BrainRegion>trigeminal ganglion</BrainRegion> (Vg). These afferents are classified as rapidly (RA) or slowly (SA) adapting by their response to stimulation. The activity of these cells in the awake behaving rat is yet unknown. Therefore, we developed a method to chronically record <BrainRegion>Vg</BrainRegion> neurons during natural whisking behaviors and found that all cells exhibited (1) no neuronal activity when the whiskers were not in motion, (2) increased activity when the rat whisked, with activity correlated to whisk frequency, and (3) robust increases in activity when the whiskers contacted an object. Moreover, we observed distinct differences in the firing rates between rapidly(RA) and SA cells, suggesting that they encode distinct aspects of stimuli in the awake rat.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Cortical</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> connections of the representations of the teeth and tongue in <BrainRegion>somatosensory cortex</BrainRegion> of new world monkeys.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Connections of representations of the teeth and tongue in <BrainRegion>primary somatosensory cortex</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>area 3b</BrainRegion>) and adjoining <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion> were revealed in owl, squirrel, and marmoset monkeys with injections of fluorescent tracers. Injection sites were identified by microelectrode recordings from neurons responsive to touch on the teeth or tongue. Patterns of cortical label were related to myeloarchitecture in sections cut parallel to the surface of flattened <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion>, and to <BrainRegion>coronal sections of the thalamus</BrainRegion> processed for cytochrome oxidase (CO). <BrainRegion>Cortical sections</BrainRegion> revealed a caudorostral series of myelin dense ovals (O1-O4) in <BrainRegion>area 3b</BrainRegion> that represent the periodontal receptors of the contralateral teeth, the contralateral tongue, the ipsilateral teeth, and the ipsilateral tongue. The <BrainRegion>ventroposterior medial subnucleus</BrainRegion>, VPM, and the <BrainRegion>ventroposterior medial parvicellular nucleus</BrainRegion> for taste, VPMpc, were identified in the t<BrainRegion>halamic sections</BrainRegion>. Injections placed in the O1 oval representing teeth labeled neurons in <BrainRegion>VPM</BrainRegion>, while injections in O2 representing the tongue labeled neurons in both <BrainRegion>VPMpc</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>VPM</BrainRegion>. These injections also labeled adjacent part of <BrainRegion>areas 3a</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>1</BrainRegion>, and locations in the <BrainRegion>lateral sulcus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>frontal lobe</BrainRegion>. Callosally, connections of the ovals were most dense with corresponding ovals. Injections in the <BrainRegion>area 1</BrainRegion> representation of the tongue labeled neurons in <BrainRegion>VPMpc</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>VPM</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>ipsilateral area 3b ovals</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>area 3a</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>opercular cortex</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>cortex in the lateral sulcus</BrainRegion>.

<AbstractText>Activation of the <BrainRegion>horizontal segment of the intraparietal sulcus</BrainRegion> (hIPS) has been observed in various number-processing tasks, whether numbers were conveyed by symbolic numerals (digits, number words) or by nonsymbolic displays (dot patterns). This suggests an abstract coding of numerical magnitude. Here, we critically tested this hypothesis using fMRI adaptation to demonstrate notation-independent coding of numerical quantity in the <BrainRegion>horizontal segment of the intraparietal sulcus</BrainRegion>(hIPS) . Once subjects were adapted either to dot patterns or to Arabic digits, activation in the <BrainRegion>horizontal segment of the intraparietal sulcus</BrainRegion>(hIPS) and in frontal regions recovered in a distance-dependent fashion whenever a new number was presented, irrespective of notation changes. This remained unchanged when analyzing the <BrainRegion>horizontal segment of the intraparietal sulcus</BrainRegion>(hIPS) peaks from an independent localizer scan of mental calculation. These results suggest an abstract coding of approximate number common to dots, digits, and number words. They support the idea that symbols acquire meaning by linking neural populations coding symbol shapes to those holding nonsymbolic representations of quantities.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Aldosterone-sensitive neurons of the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion>: multisynaptic pathway to the <BrainRegion>nucleus accumbens</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The <BrainRegion>nucleus accumbens</BrainRegion> (NAc) is part of a <BrainRegion>forebrain</BrainRegion> system implicated in reward, motivation, and learning. <BrainRegion>nucleus accumbens</BrainRegion>(NAc) neurons become activated during various ingestive activities, including salt intake. A subset of neurons within the <BrainRegion>nucleus tractus solitarius</BrainRegion> (NTS) shows c-Fos activation during prolonged sodium deprivation in rats. These neurons express mineralocorticoid receptors and the enzyme 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (HSD2), which makes them selectively sensitive to aldosterone-an adrenal hormone that modulates sodium appetite. Here we tested whether these neurons project multisynaptically to the core or shell subregions of the <BrainRegion>nucleus accumbens</BrainRegion>(NAc) . Pseudorabies virus (PRV)-a retrograde transneuronal tracer-was injected into the <BrainRegion>nucleus accumbens</BrainRegion>(NAc) in rats and after 3-4 days Pseudorabies virus(PRV) -infected 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2(HSD2) neurons were identified. Pseudorabies virus(PRV) injections into the <BrainRegion>nucleus accumbens</BrainRegion>(NAc) core yielded greater numbers of Pseudorabies virus(PRV) -labeled 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2(HSD2) neurons than did comparable injections into the <BrainRegion>nucleus accumbens</BrainRegion>(NAc) shell. Transneuronal labeling was also found in <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion> sites that receive direct projections from 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2(HSD2) neurons, namely, <BrainRegion>lateral parabrachial</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>prelocus coeruleus nuclei</BrainRegion>. In other experiments a retrograde neural tracer (cholera toxin beta-subunit) was injected into the <BrainRegion>nucleus accumbens</BrainRegion>(NAc) . Extensive retrograde labeling was found in the <BrainRegion>midline thalamus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>frontal cortical regions</BrainRegion>, but no cells were labeled in the <BrainRegion>nucleus tractus solitarius</BrainRegion>(NTS) or <BrainRegion>parabrachial region</BrainRegion>. These findings indicate that the 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2(HSD2) neurons project via a multisynaptic pathway to the <BrainRegion>nucleus accumbens</BrainRegion>(NAc) , which may be relayed sequentially through two sites: the <BrainRegion>dorsolateral pons</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>paraventricular thalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>. 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2(HSD2) neurons may be part of an ascending pathway involved in the salt-seeking behavior of sodium-depleted rats.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Deficits in short-latency tracking eye movements after chemical lesions in monkey <BrainRegion>cortical areas MT</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>MST</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Past work has suggested that the <BrainRegion>medial superior temporal area</BrainRegion> (MST) is involved in the initiation of three kinds of eye movements at short latency by large-field visual stimuli. These eye movements consist of (1) version elicited by linear motion (the ocular following response), (2) vergence elicited by binocular parallax (the disparity vergence response), and (3) vergence elicited by global motion toward or away from the fovea (the radial-flow vergence response). We investigated this hypothesis by recording the effects of ibotenic acid injections in the <BrainRegion>superior temporal sulcus</BrainRegion> (STS) of both hemispheres in five monkeys. After the injections, all three kinds of eye movements were significantly impaired, with the magnitude of the impairments often showing a strong correlation with the extent of the morphological damage in the three subregions of the <BrainRegion>superior temporal sulcus</BrainRegion>(STS) : <BrainRegion>dorsal medial superior temporal area</BrainRegion>(MST) on the anterior bank, <BrainRegion>lateral medial superior temporal area</BrainRegion>(MST) and <BrainRegion>middle temporal area</BrainRegion> on the posterior bank. However, the extent of the lesions in the three subregions often covaried, rendering it difficult to assess their relative contributions to the various deficits. The effects of the lesions on other aspects of oculomotor behavior that are known to be important for the normal functioning of the three tracking mechanisms (e.g., ocular stability, fixation disparity) were judged to be generally minor and to contribute little to the impairments. We conclude that, insofar as <BrainRegion>medial superior temporal area</BrainRegion>(MST) sustained significant damage in all injected hemispheres, our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that <BrainRegion>medial superior temporal area</BrainRegion>(MST) is a primary site for initiating all three visual tracking eye movements at ultra-short latencies.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Ultrastructure of primary afferent terminals and synapses in the rat <BrainRegion>nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion>: Comparison among the greater superficial petrosal, chorda tympani, and glossopharyngeal nerves.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The greater superficial petrosal (GSP), chorda tympani (CT), and glossopharyngeal (IX) nerves terminate in overlapping patterns in the <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion> in the rat <BrainRegion>nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion> (NTS). There is one region, in particular, that receives overlapping inputs from all three nerves and is especially plastic during normal and experimentally altered development. To provide the requisite data necessary ultimately to delineate the circuitry in this region, we characterized the morphology of the synaptic inputs provided by the greater superficial petrosal(GSP) , chorda tympani(CT) , and IX nerves through transmission electron microscopy. Although all three nerves had features characteristic of excitatory nerve terminals, ultrastructural analysis revealed dimorphic morphologies differentiating IX terminals from greater superficial petrosal(GSP) and chorda tympani(CT) terminals. IX terminals had a larger area than greater superficial petrosal(GSP) and chorda tympani(CT) terminals, and more synapses were associated with IX terminals compared with greater superficial petrosal(GSP) and chorda tympani(CT) terminals. Additionally, IX terminals formed synapses most often with spines, as opposed to greater superficial petrosal(GSP) and chorda tympani(CT) terminals, which formed synapses more often with dendrites. IX terminals also exhibited morphological features often associated with synaptic plasticity more often than was seen for greater superficial petrosal(GSP) and chorda tympani(CT) terminals. These normative data form the basis for future studies of developmentally and environmentally induced plasticity in the rodent <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion>. J. Comp.

<ArticleTitle>Multisensory convergence in <BrainRegion>auditory cortex</BrainRegion>, I. Cortical connections of the c<BrainRegion>audal superior temporal plane</BrainRegion> in macaque monkeys.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The <BrainRegion>caudal medial auditory area</BrainRegion> (CM) has anatomical and physiological features consistent with its role as a first-stage (or &quot;belt") <BrainRegion>auditory association cortex</BrainRegion>. It is also a site of multisensory convergence, with robust somatosensory and auditory responses. In this study, we investigated the cerebral cortical sources of somatosensory and auditory inputs to <BrainRegion>caudal medial auditory area</BrainRegion>(CM) by injecting retrograde tracers in macaque monkeys. A companion paper describes the <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> connections of <BrainRegion>caudal medial auditory area</BrainRegion>(CM) (Hackett et al., J. Comp. Neurol. [this issue]). The likely <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> sources of somatosensory input to <BrainRegion>caudal medial auditory area</BrainRegion>(CM) were the adjacent <BrainRegion>retroinsular cortex</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>area Ri</BrainRegion>) and <BrainRegion>granular insula</BrainRegion> (Ig). In addition, <BrainRegion>caudal medial auditory area</BrainRegion>(CM) had reliable connections with <BrainRegion>areas Tpt</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>TPO</BrainRegion>, which are sites of multisensory integration. <BrainRegion>caudal medial auditory area</BrainRegion>(CM) also had topographic connections with other auditory areas. As expected, connections with adjacent <BrainRegion>caudal auditory areas</BrainRegion> were stronger than connections with <BrainRegion>rostral areas</BrainRegion>. Surprisingly, the connections with the core were concentrated along its medial side, suggesting that there may be a medial-lateral division of function within the core. Additional injections into <BrainRegion>caudal lateral auditory area</BrainRegion> (CL) and <BrainRegion>Tpt</BrainRegion> showed similar connections with <BrainRegion>Ri</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>Ig</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>TPO</BrainRegion>. In contrast to <BrainRegion>caudal medial auditory area</BrainRegion>(CM) injections, these lateral injections had inputs from <BrainRegion>parietal area 7a</BrainRegion> and had a preferential connection with the <BrainRegion>lateral (gyral) part of Tpt</BrainRegion>. Taken together, the findings indicate that <BrainRegion>caudal medial auditory area</BrainRegion>(CM) may receive somatosensory input from nearby areas along the <BrainRegion>fundus of the lateral sulcus</BrainRegion>. The differential connections of <BrainRegion>caudal medial auditory area</BrainRegion>(CM) compared with adjacent areas provide additional evidence for the functional specialization of the individual auditory belt areas.

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Subthalamic</BrainRegion> stimulation and neuronal activity in the <BrainRegion>substantia nigra</BrainRegion> in Parkinson&apos;s disease.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>High frequency stimulation of the <BrainRegion>subthalamic (STN) nucleus</BrainRegion> is an effective treatment for severe forms of Parkinson&apos;s disease (PD). To study the effects of high-frequency stimulation of the subthalamic(<BrainRegion>STN</BrainRegion>) stimulation on one of the main output pathways of the <BrainRegion>basal ganglia</BrainRegion>, single-unit recordings of the neuronal activity of the <BrainRegion>substantia nigra pars reticulata</BrainRegion> (SNr) were performed before, during and after the application of stimulation of the subthalamic(<BrainRegion>STN</BrainRegion>) electrical stimulation in 8 Parkinson&apos;s disease(PD) patients. During stimulation of the subthalamic(<BrainRegion>STN</BrainRegion>) stimulation at 14-Hz, no change in either the mean firing rate or the discharge pattern of <BrainRegion>substantia nigra pars reticulata</BrainRegion>(SNr) neurons was observed. stimulation of the subthalamic(<BrainRegion>STN</BrainRegion>) stimulation at 140-Hz decreased the mean firing rate by 64% and the mean duration of bursting mode activity of <BrainRegion>substantia nigra pars reticulata</BrainRegion>(SNr) neurons by 70%. The <BrainRegion>substantia nigra pars reticulata</BrainRegion>(SNr) residual neuronal activity during 140-Hz stimulation of the subthalamic(<BrainRegion>STN</BrainRegion>) stimulation was driven by the stimulation of the subthalamic(STN) stimulation. How the decrease in rate and modification of firing pattern with evoked neuronal activity of <BrainRegion>substantia nigra pars reticulata</BrainRegion>(SNr) neurons during high frequency stimulation of the subthalamic(<BrainRegion>STN</BrainRegion>) stimulation contribute to the improvement of Parkinsonian motor disability remains to be elucidated.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Neuronal degeneration and reorganization: a mutual principle in pathological and in healthy interactions of <BrainRegion>limbic</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>prefrontal circuits</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Based on developmental principles and insights from animal research about neuroplasticity in cell assemblies, this article is to propose a view of plasticity that promotes a link between <BrainRegion>hippocampal</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>prefrontal</BrainRegion> structure and function. Both the mitotic activity (counting of BrdU-labeled cells) in <BrainRegion>hippocampal dentatus</BrainRegion> and the maturation of dopamine fibres (quantitative immunochemistry of mesoprefrontal projection) in the <BrainRegion>prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion> proved to be a measurable combination for investigating the complex chain of events that relate activity dependent neuroplasticity to normal as well as to pathological maturational processes. With our animal model we demonstrate that both rearing conditions and neuroactive substances can effectively interfere with developmental plasticity and induce a malfunctional adaptation of <BrainRegion>prefrontal structures</BrainRegion> and neurotransmitter systems ( developmental plasticity and induce a malfunctional adaptation of prefrontal structures and neurotransmitter systems(dopamine) , GABA). In the <BrainRegion>hippocampal dentatus</BrainRegion>, where ontogenetic plasticity proved to be preserved by continued neuro- and synaptogenesis, serious damage can be internalized without simultaneous disruption of neural dynamics offering an approach to reverse dysfunctional reorganization in the <BrainRegion>prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Thalamic</BrainRegion> projections from the whisker-sensitive regions of the <BrainRegion>spinal trigeminal complex</BrainRegion> in the rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>This study investigated the axonal projections of whisker-sensitive cells of the <BrainRegion>spinal trigeminal subnuclei</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>SP5</BrainRegion>) in rat oral, interpolar, and caudal divisions (SP5o, SP5i, and SP5c, respectively). The labeling of small groups of trigeminothalamic axons with biotinylated dextran amine disclosed the following classes of axons. 1) Few SP5o cells project to the <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion>: They innervate the <BrainRegion>caudal part of the posterior group</BrainRegion> (Po) and the region intercalated between the <BrainRegion>anterior pretectal</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>medial geniculate nuclei</BrainRegion>. These fibers also branch profusely in the <BrainRegion>tectum</BrainRegion>. 2) Two types of ascending fibers arise from SP5i: Type I fibers are thick and distribute to the <BrainRegion>posterior group</BrainRegion>(Po) and to other regions of the <BrainRegion>midbrain</BrainRegion>, i.e., the <BrainRegion>prerubral field</BrainRegion>, the deep layers of the <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>anterior pretectal nucleus</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>ventral part of the zona incerta</BrainRegion>. Type II fibers are thin; branch sparsely in the <BrainRegion>tectum</BrainRegion>; and form small-sized, bushy arbors in the <BrainRegion>ventral posterior medial nucleus</BrainRegion> (VPM). Accordingly, a statistical analysis of the distribution of antidromic invasion latencies of 96 SP5i cells to <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> stimulation disclosed two populations of neurons: fast-conducting cells, which invaded at a mean latency of 1.23 +/- 0. 62 msec, and slow-conducting cells, which invaded at a mean latency of 2.97 +/- 0.62 msec. 3) The rostral part of SP5c contains cells with <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> projections similar to that of type II SP5i neurons, whereas the caudal part did not label <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> fibers in this study. A comparison of SP5i projections and PR5 projections in the <BrainRegion>ventral posterior medial nucleus</BrainRegion>(VPM) revealed that the former are restricted to ventral-lateral tier of the nucleus, whereas the latter terminate principally in the upper two tiers of the <BrainRegion>ventral posterior medial nucleus</BrainRegion>(VPM) . These results suggest a functional compartmentation of <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> barreloids that is defined by the topographic distribution of PR5 and type II SP5i afferents.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Corticofugal connections between the <BrainRegion>cerebral cortex</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>vestibular nuclei</BrainRegion> in the rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The distribution of <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> efferent connections to the <BrainRegion>vestibular nuclei</BrainRegion> was quantitatively analyzed by means of retrograde axonal transport of horseradish peroxidase, wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase, and Fast Blue in rats. The tracer substances were injected into the <BrainRegion>spinal vestibular nucleus</BrainRegion> (SpVe), the <BrainRegion>caudal part of the medial vestibular nucleus</BrainRegion> (MVe), and <BrainRegion>nucleus X</BrainRegion> of Brown Norwegian rats. Projections to the <BrainRegion>vestibular nuclei</BrainRegion> were revealed bilaterally, but predominantly contralaterally from five cortical areas: (1) the <BrainRegion>parietotemporal region</BrainRegion> (PT) which occupied the <BrainRegion>caudal two-thirds of the secondary somatosensory area</BrainRegion> and spread over the <BrainRegion>caudal part of the primary somatosensory area</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>visceral cortex</BrainRegion>; (2) the <BrainRegion>anterior forelimb</BrainRegion> (AF) overlapping the <BrainRegion>anterior part of the forelimb area</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>transitional zone</BrainRegion>; (3) the <BrainRegion>anterior hindlimb</BrainRegion> (AH) overlapping the <BrainRegion>anterior part of the hindlimb area</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>transitional zone</BrainRegion>; (4) the <BrainRegion>lateral forelimb</BrainRegion> (LF) centered in the <BrainRegion>intercalated zone lateral to the forelimb area</BrainRegion>; and (5) the <BrainRegion>ventrotemporal region</BrainRegion> (VT) located at the <BrainRegion>ventral part of the temporal cortex</BrainRegion>. In addition to these <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> fields, the <BrainRegion>frontal cortex</BrainRegion> was found to project directly to the <BrainRegion>vestibular nuclei</BrainRegion>. These corticofugal projections were verified in experiments in which biocytin was injected into the rat <BrainRegion>parietotemporal region</BrainRegion>(PT) . Anterogradely labelled fibers were traced predominantly contralaterally to the <BrainRegion>spinal vestibular nucleus</BrainRegion>(SpVe) , <BrainRegion>caudal part of the medial vestibular nucleus</BrainRegion>(MVe) , and <BrainRegion>nucleus X</BrainRegion>. It is suggested that the rat corticofugal projections to the <BrainRegion>caudal vestibular nuclei</BrainRegion> modify vestibular reflexes to assist in coordinating eye, head and body movements during locomotion.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Efferent projections of the <BrainRegion>intergeniculate leaflet</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>ventral lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion> in the rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The <BrainRegion>intergeniculate leaflet</BrainRegion> (IGL) and the <BrainRegion>ventral lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion> (VLG) are <BrainRegion>ventral thalamic</BrainRegion> derivatives within the <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate complex</BrainRegion>. In this study, <BrainRegion>intergeniculate leaflet</BrainRegion>(IGL) and <BrainRegion>ventral lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(VLG) efferent projections were compared by using anterograde transport of Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin and retrograde transport of FluoroGold. Projections from the <BrainRegion>intergeniculate leaflet</BrainRegion>(IGL) and <BrainRegion>ventral lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(VLG) leave the <BrainRegion>geniculate</BrainRegion> in four pathways. A dorsal pathway innervates the <BrainRegion>thalamic lateral dorsal nucleus</BrainRegion> ( <BrainRegion>ventral lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(VLG) ), the <BrainRegion>reuniens</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>rhomboid nuclei</BrainRegion> ( <BrainRegion>ventral lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(VLG) and <BrainRegion>intergeniculate leaflet</BrainRegion>(IGL) ), and the <BrainRegion>paraventricular nucleus</BrainRegion> ( <BrainRegion>intergeniculate leaflet</BrainRegion>(IGL) ). A ventral pathway runs through the geniculohypothalamic tract to the <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>anterior hypothalamus</BrainRegion> ( <BrainRegion>intergeniculate leaflet</BrainRegion>(IGL) ). A medial pathway innervates the <BrainRegion>zona incerta</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>dorsal hypothalamus</BrainRegion> ( <BrainRegion>ventral lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(VLG) and <BrainRegion>intergeniculate leaflet</BrainRegion>(IGL) ); the <BrainRegion>lateral hypothalamus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>perifornical area</BrainRegion> ( <BrainRegion>ventral lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(VLG) ); and the <BrainRegion>retrochiasmatic area</BrainRegion> (RCA), <BrainRegion>dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>subparaventricular zone</BrainRegion> ( <BrainRegion>intergeniculate leaflet</BrainRegion>(IGL) ). A caudal pathway projects medially to the <BrainRegion>posterior hypothalamic area</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion> and caudally along the brachium of the <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>medial pretectal area</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the optic tract</BrainRegion> ( <BrainRegion>intergeniculate leaflet</BrainRegion>(IGL) and <BrainRegion>ventral lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(VLG) ). <BrainRegion>Caudal intergeniculate leaflet</BrainRegion>(IGL) axons also terminate in the <BrainRegion>olivary pretectal nucleus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>superficial gray of the superior colliculus</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>lateral and dorsal terminal nuclei of the accessory optic system</BrainRegion>. <BrainRegion>Caudal ventral lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(VLG) projections innervate the <BrainRegion>lateral posterior nucleus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>anterior pretectal nucleus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>intermediate and deep gray of the superior colliculus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>dorsal terminal nucleus</BrainRegion>, the midbrain <BrainRegion>lateral tegmental field</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>interpeduncular nucleus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>ventral pontine reticular formation</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>medial and lateral pontine gray</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>parabrachial region</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>accessory inferior olive</BrainRegion>. This pattern of <BrainRegion>intergeniculate leaflet</BrainRegion>(IGL) and <BrainRegion>ventral lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(VLG) projections is consistent with our understanding of the distinct functions of each of these <BrainRegion>ventral thalamic</BrainRegion> derivatives.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Topographic organization of <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> inputs to the lateral nucleus of the macaque monkey <BrainRegion>amygdala</BrainRegion>: a retrograde tracing study.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The objective of this study was to identify <BrainRegion>cortical areas</BrainRegion> that project to the <BrainRegion>lateral nucleus</BrainRegion> of the macaque monkey <BrainRegion>amygdaloid complex</BrainRegion>. Discrete injections of the fluorescent retrograde tracers Fast blue and Diamidino yellow were placed into different locations within the <BrainRegion>lateral nucleus</BrainRegion>. Retrogradely labeled cells were mapped using a computer-aided digitizing system. In the <BrainRegion>frontal cortex</BrainRegion>, low numbers of retrogradely labeled cells were observed in medial and orbitofrontal regions (<BrainRegion>areas 10</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>11</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>12</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>13</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>13a</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>14</BrainRegion>). In the <BrainRegion>anterior cingulate cortex</BrainRegion>, low to moderate numbers of retrogradely labeled cells were located in <BrainRegion>areas 25</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>24</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>32</BrainRegion>. In the <BrainRegion>insula</BrainRegion>, there were moderate to high numbers of retrogradely labeled cells in agranular and dysgranular regions. The <BrainRegion>parainsula cortex</BrainRegion> also demonstrated a moderate to high number of retrogradely labeled cells. In the <BrainRegion>temporal lobe</BrainRegion>, retrogradely labeled cells were most numerous in the rostral (polar) portion of the <BrainRegion>perirhinal cortex</BrainRegion>. Large numbers of labeled cells were also located throughout more <BrainRegion>caudal portions of the perirhinal regions</BrainRegion> as well as in the <BrainRegion>entorhinal cortex</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>area TE</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>superior temporal gyrus</BrainRegion>. Fewer retrogradely labeled cells were observed in the <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion> along the dorsal bank of the <BrainRegion>superior temporal sulcus</BrainRegion>, in the <BrainRegion>parahippocampal cortex</BrainRegion>, and in <BrainRegion>area TEO</BrainRegion>. Although retrograde tracers can provide only limited evidence for topography, we nonetheless noted that the density of retrogradely labeled cells in a <BrainRegion>cortical area</BrainRegion> reliably depended on the location of the tracer injection in the <BrainRegion>lateral nucleus</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Topographic projection from the <BrainRegion>optic tectum</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>auditory space map in the inferior colliculus</BrainRegion> of the barn owl.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>In the barn owl (Tyto alba), the <BrainRegion>external nucleus of the inferior colliculus</BrainRegion> (ICX) contains a map of auditory space that is calibrated by visual experience. The source of the visually based instructive signal to the <BrainRegion>ICX</BrainRegion> is unknown. Injections of biotinylated dextran amine and Fluoro-Gold in the <BrainRegion>ICX</BrainRegion> retrogradely labelled neurons in layers 8-15 of the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral optic tectum</BrainRegion> (OT) that could carry this instructive signal. This projection was point-to-point and in register with the feed-forward, auditory projection from the <BrainRegion>ICX</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>optic tectum</BrainRegion>(OT) . Most labelled neurons were in layers 10-11, and most were bipolar. Tripolar, multipolar, and unipolar neurons were also observed. Multipolar neurons had dendrites that were oriented parallel to the <BrainRegion>tectal laminae</BrainRegion>. In contrast, most labelled bipolar and tripolar neurons had dendrites oriented perpendicular to the <BrainRegion>tectal laminae</BrainRegion>, extending superficially into the <BrainRegion>retino-recipient laminae</BrainRegion> and deep into the <BrainRegion>auditory recipient</BrainRegion> laminae. Therefore, these neurons were positioned to receive both visual and auditory information from particular locations in space. Biocytin injected into the superficial layers of the <BrainRegion>optic tectum</BrainRegion>(OT) labelled bouton-laden axons in the <BrainRegion>ICX</BrainRegion>. These axons were generally finer than, but had similar bouton densities as, feed-forward auditory fibers in the <BrainRegion>ICX</BrainRegion>, labelled by injections of biocytin into the <BrainRegion>central nucleus of the inferior colliculus</BrainRegion> (ICC). These data demonstrate a point-to-point projection from the <BrainRegion>optic tectum</BrainRegion>(OT) to the <BrainRegion>ICX</BrainRegion> that could provide a spatial template for calibrating the auditory space map in the <BrainRegion>ICX</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Subcortical projections of <BrainRegion>area 25</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>subgenual cortex</BrainRegion>) of the macaque monkey.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>In several species, including primates, stimulation studies indicate that the <BrainRegion>infralimbic cortex</BrainRegion>, the most caudal part of the <BrainRegion>ventromedial prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion>, functions as a visceral motor region. In addition, recent positron emission tomography studies implicate the <BrainRegion>subgenual region</BrainRegion> in depression and mania. To determine the <BrainRegion>subcortical</BrainRegion> projections of this region in primates, injections of Phaseolus vulgaris leukoagglutinin, biotinylated dextran amine, or rhodamine-labeled dextran amine were placed in <BrainRegion>area 25</BrainRegion> in three monkeys. In contrast to the efferents from <BrainRegion>area 25</BrainRegion> previously described in the rat, there were no projections to <BrainRegion>autonomic effector regions</BrainRegion>, such as the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion>, magnocellular neurosecretory cell groups in the <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>ventrolateral medulla</BrainRegion>, or <BrainRegion>intermediolateral column of the spinal cord</BrainRegion>. However, projections were shown to a number of structures with probable roles in autonomic function and direct connections to some of the abovementioned autonomic effector regions, including <BrainRegion>bed nucleus of the stria terminalis</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>perifornical and anterior hypothalamus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>lateral parabrachial nucleus</BrainRegion>. In addition, there were projections to several <BrainRegion>forebrain</BrainRegion> structures that receive projections from other components of the <BrainRegion>medial prefrontal network</BrainRegion> including the <BrainRegion>medial part of the caudate nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>lateral septum</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>midline and mediodorsal thalamic nuclei</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>lateral parvocellular part of the basal accessory amygdaloid nucleus</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>magnocellular part of the basal amygdaloid</BrainRegion>. None of the injections resulted in labeling in the <BrainRegion>medulla</BrainRegion>. These connections support the idea of a role for <BrainRegion>cortical area 25</BrainRegion> in emotional and autonomic responses, albeit less direct than that described in rodents.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Thalamic</BrainRegion> terminal fields of individual axons from the <BrainRegion>ventral part of the dentate nucleus of the cerebellum</BrainRegion> in Macaca mulatta.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>This study examined organization of the projection from the <BrainRegion>dentate nucleus of the cerebellum</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>ventral lateral nucleus (VL) of the thalamus</BrainRegion> in Macaca mulatta. Small injections of biotinylated dextran amine were placed in the <BrainRegion>ventral parts of dentate nuclei</BrainRegion>. The distribution of all contralateral terminal fields in the <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion> was charted, and representative individual axons that terminated in the <BrainRegion>ventral lateral nucleus</BrainRegion>(VL) were traced in serial sections under the light microscope. These axons were reconstructed with all their branches and terminal fields in the <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion>. The geometry and size of the terminal fields as well as the number and distribution of boutons and neurons in them were analyzed. The terminal fields of all labeled axons were distributed widely over the <BrainRegion>ventral lateral nucleus</BrainRegion>(VL) either singly or in clusters. Two types of axons were found: simple axons formed only one terminal field and complex axons formed multiple terminal fields at a distance. Individual terminal fields were focal, had the form of flattened discs, and generated up to 200 boutons distributed between 10 and 29 nerve cell bodies. These findings suggest that a simple axon activates a small group of neurons at one site. The complex axons, in turn, influence similar size cell groups at different <BrainRegion>ventral lateral nucleus</BrainRegion>(VL) locations. The total number of boutons generated by a single complex axon was up to 300. Future studies should determine whether simple axons could be branches of complex axons that took off below the <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion>. The results reveal a complex organization of the input from the <BrainRegion>ventral dentate</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>ventral lateral nucleus</BrainRegion>(VL) that only partially fits into the traditional concept of somatotopic organization of the nucleus.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Forebrain</BrainRegion> projections to the <BrainRegion>rostral nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion> in the hamster.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The <BrainRegion>rostral nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion> (NST) is the first central site of taste information processing. Specific anatomical subdivisions of the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion>(NST) receive taste afferent input and contain interneurons and projection neurons that engage ascending or <BrainRegion>premotor</BrainRegion> taste pathways. The <BrainRegion>forebrain</BrainRegion> projects to the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion>(NST) and can influence taste responses, but the anatomical relationship between <BrainRegion>forebrain</BrainRegion> inputs and the subdivisions of the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion>(NST) and their cellular elements is not understood. To evaluate this, in this study, we used cholera toxin B (CTb) as a retrograde and anterograde marker. cholera toxin B(CTb) was injected into the <BrainRegion>rostral nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion>(NST) to label, by retrograde transport, the sources of <BrainRegion>forebrain</BrainRegion> inputs. Cells were labeled bilaterally in the <BrainRegion>lateral and paraventricular hypothalamic nuclei</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>bed nucleus of the stria terminalis</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>central nuclei of the amygdala</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>agranular and dysgranular divisions of insular cortex</BrainRegion>. Within the <BrainRegion>medulla</BrainRegion>, labeled cells were located in the <BrainRegion>parvicellular reticular formation</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>spinal trigeminal nuclei</BrainRegion>. In addition, labeled cells and anterograde axonal labeling were present in the <BrainRegion>rostral nucleus of the solitary tract(NST) contralateral</BrainRegion> to the injections. Injections of cholera toxin B(CTb) centered in the <BrainRegion>dysgranular insular cortex</BrainRegion>, the site of most <BrainRegion>forebrain</BrainRegion>- <BrainRegion>nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion>(NST) cells, labeled axon endings confined to the <BrainRegion>rostral nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion>(NST) . These endings were concentrated in the rostral central and ventral subdivisions. Corticofugal endings in the rostral central subdivision are positioned to influence microcircuits that include taste afferent synapses, presumed inhibitory interneurons, and neurons that project to the <BrainRegion>parabrachial nucleus</BrainRegion>. The many corticofugal endings in the ventral subdivision synapse among <BrainRegion>premotor</BrainRegion> neurons that ultimately influence salivatory and oromotor outflow. Intramedullary cholera toxin B(CTb) labeling after <BrainRegion>nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion>(NST) injection indicates that the rostral central subdivision also receives projections from the <BrainRegion>contralateral rostral nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion>(NST) .</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Orbitomedial prefrontal cortical</BrainRegion> projections to distinct longitudinal columns of the <BrainRegion>periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion> in the rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>We utilised retrograde and anterograde tracing procedures to study the origin and termination of <BrainRegion>prefrontal cortical</BrainRegion> (PFC) projections to the <BrainRegion>periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion> (PAG) in the rat. A previous study, in the primate, had demonstrated that distinct subgroups of <BrainRegion>prefrontal cortical</BrainRegion>(PFC) areas project to specific <BrainRegion>periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion>(PAG) columns. Retrograde tracing experiments revealed that projections to <BrainRegion>dorsolateral (dl periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion>(PAG) ) and ventrolateral (<BrainRegion>vl periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion>(PAG) ) <BrainRegion>periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion> columns arose from <BrainRegion>medial prefrontal cortical</BrainRegion>(PFC) , specifically <BrainRegion>prelimbic</BrainRegion>, infralimbic, and <BrainRegion>anterior cingulate cortices</BrainRegion>. Injections made in the <BrainRegion>vl periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion>(PAG) also labeled cells in <BrainRegion>medial, ventral, and dorsolateral orbital cortex</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>dorsal and posterior agranular insular cortex</BrainRegion>. Other <BrainRegion>orbital and insular regions</BrainRegion>, including <BrainRegion>lateral and ventrolateral orbital</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>ventral agranular insular</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>dysgranular and granular insular cortex</BrainRegion> did not give rise to appreciable projections to the <BrainRegion>periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion>(PAG) . Anterograde tracing experiments revealed that the projections to different <BrainRegion>periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion>(PAG) columns arose from specific <BrainRegion>prefrontal cortical</BrainRegion>(PFC) areas. Projections from the <BrainRegion>caudodorsal medial prefrontal cortical</BrainRegion>(PFC) (<BrainRegion>caudal prelimbic</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>anterior cingulate cortices</BrainRegion>) terminated predominantly in <BrainRegion>dl periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion>(PAG) , whereas projections from the <BrainRegion>rostroventral medial prefrontal cortical</BrainRegion>(PFC) (<BrainRegion>rostral prelimbic cortex</BrainRegion>) innervated predominantly the <BrainRegion>vl periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion>(PAG) . As well, consistent with the retrograde data, projections arising from select <BrainRegion>orbital and agranular insular cortical areas</BrainRegion> terminated selectively in the <BrainRegion>vl periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion>(PAG) . The results indicate: (1) that rat <BrainRegion>orbital and medial prefrontal cortical</BrainRegion>(PFC) possesses an organisation broadly similar to that of the primate; and (2) that subdivisions within the rat <BrainRegion>orbital and medial prefrontal cortical</BrainRegion>(PFC) can be recognised on the basis of projections to distinct <BrainRegion>periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion>(PAG) columns.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Afferent connections of the <BrainRegion>dorsal premammillary nucleus</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The <BrainRegion>dorsal premammillary nucleus</BrainRegion> (PMd) is thought to play a critical role for the expression of fear responses to environmental threats. We have reported previously that during an encounter with a predator the <BrainRegion>PMd</BrainRegion> presents an impressive increase in Fos levels and cell body-specific chemical lesions therein virtually eliminate the expression of escape and freezing responses. In the present study, we carried out a systematic analysis of <BrainRegion>PMd</BrainRegion> afferent connections combining anterograde and retrograde tracing methods in the rat. We show that the nucleus receives inputs from several widely distributed areas in the <BrainRegion>forebrain</BrainRegion> and, to a much lesser extent, from the <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion> as well. From this information, it seems that the major <BrainRegion>telencephalic</BrainRegion> source of input to the <BrainRegion>PMd</BrainRegion> is the <BrainRegion>interfascicular nucleus of the bed nuclei of the stria terminalis</BrainRegion>. In addition, substantial <BrainRegion>telencephalic</BrainRegion> inputs to the nucleus seem to arise from the <BrainRegion>infralimbic and prelimbic areas</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>lateral septal nucleus</BrainRegion>. In the <BrainRegion>diencephalon</BrainRegion>, massive inputs to the <BrainRegion>PMd</BrainRegion> arise from the <BrainRegion>anterior hypothalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>, specific parts of the <BrainRegion>perifornical region</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>retinoceptive region of the lateral hypothalamic area</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>anterior and dorsomedial parts of the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>. In contrast, the <BrainRegion>ventral tegmental nucleus</BrainRegion> seems to be the only <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion> site that provides substantial inputs to the <BrainRegion>PMd</BrainRegion>. Overall, the present analysis helps to delineate <BrainRegion>prosencephalic</BrainRegion> circuits seemingly critical for the organization of innate fear responses to environmental threats, where the <BrainRegion>PMd</BrainRegion> presents a major associative role. Furthermore, by means of massive inputs from the <BrainRegion>ventral tegmental nucleus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>PMd</BrainRegion> is in a position to integrate information from a neural system involved in spatial working memory, which may be of particular relevance for an effect of attentional mechanisms on the selection of appropriate escape strategies.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Macaque <BrainRegion>red nucleus</BrainRegion>: origins of <BrainRegion>spinal</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>olivary</BrainRegion> projections and terminations of <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> inputs.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The <BrainRegion>cerebellar</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>spinal</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>bulbar</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> connections of the mammalian <BrainRegion>red nucleus</BrainRegion> imply a motor role. However, what information the <BrainRegion>red nucleus</BrainRegion> receives, processes, and distributes is poorly understood, partly because the rubral microcircuitry, especially in primates, remains incompletely defined. Multiple retrogradely transported fluorescent tracers were injected into the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>inferior olive</BrainRegion> of the macaque to label rubrospinal and <BrainRegion>rubroolivary</BrainRegion> neuron populations, respectively. Anterograde dextran amines were used to label the terminals of corticorubral neurons. These data provided the topographic framework for examining the morphology of rubral neurons in the accompanying paper (Burman et al. [2000]). Soma profiles of rubrospinal and <BrainRegion>rubro-olivary</BrainRegion> neurons were respectively segregated in the <BrainRegion>magnocellular</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>parvocellular nuclei</BrainRegion>. A subpopulation of neurons (DL-spinal cells) with their somas immediately dorsolateral to the <BrainRegion>rostral magnocellular nucleus</BrainRegion> and its capsule, also projected to the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>, as did clusters of neurons in the <BrainRegion>periaqueductal grey matter</BrainRegion>. Terminals of corticorubral axons originating from <BrainRegion>ipsilateral primary motor area 4</BrainRegion> (the densest projection), the <BrainRegion>supplementary motor area</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>cingulate area 24</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>area 8</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>posterior parietal area 5</BrainRegion>, were each mapped in the <BrainRegion>parvocellular red nucleus</BrainRegion>. Only <BrainRegion>area 4</BrainRegion> projected to the <BrainRegion>magnocellular red nucleus</BrainRegion>, and this projection as small. DL-spinal neurons had no <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> input. The somatotopic organization of rubral connections was examined only in (a) the corticorubral input from <BrainRegion>motor area 4</BrainRegion>, and (b) the rubrospinal and DL-spinal projections. These connections and their somatotopic alignment, were mapped in a 3-dimensional reconstruction of the <BrainRegion>red nucleus</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Connections between the <BrainRegion>medial temporal cortex</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>CA1 subfield of the hippocampal formation</BrainRegion> in the Japanese monkey (Macaca fuscata).</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The connections between the <BrainRegion>medial temporal cortical areas</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>CA1 of the hippocampus</BrainRegion> were examined in the Japanese monkey (Macaca fuscata) by means of retrograde and anterograde tract-tracing methods with wheat germ agglutinin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) and fluorescent dyes (Fast Blue and Diamidino Yellow). The <BrainRegion>posterior parahippocampal</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>areas TF1</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>TF2</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>TH</BrainRegion>), <BrainRegion>perirhinal</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>areas 35</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>36</BrainRegion>), and <BrainRegion>ventral inferotemporal areas</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>areas TEav</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>TEpv</BrainRegion>) were reciprocally connected with <BrainRegion>CA1</BrainRegion>. Projection fibers from <BrainRegion>CA1</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>medial temporal cortical areas</BrainRegion> originated in the pyramidal cell layer, whereas those from the <BrainRegion>medial temporal cortical areas</BrainRegion> to <BrainRegion>CA1</BrainRegion> terminated in the molecular layer. Each of these <BrainRegion>cortical areas</BrainRegion> was reciprocally connected with the entire rostrocaudal extent of <BrainRegion>CA1</BrainRegion>. However, the intensity of the connections varied along the rostrocaudal axis of <BrainRegion>CA1</BrainRegion>: <BrainRegion>areas TH</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>TF2</BrainRegion> were connected most markedly with the <BrainRegion>anterior and middle parts of CA1</BrainRegion>, respectively. <BrainRegion>Areas TF</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>35</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>36</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>TEav</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>TEpv</BrainRegion> were connected predominantly with the <BrainRegion>posterior part of CA1</BrainRegion>. In the <BrainRegion>coronal plane of CA1</BrainRegion>, labeled cells were located in <BrainRegion>proximal CA1</BrainRegion> (i. e., near the <BrainRegion>prosubiculum</BrainRegion>), but not in <BrainRegion>distal CA1</BrainRegion> (i.e., near <BrainRegion>CA2</BrainRegion>). The <BrainRegion>medial temporal cortical areas</BrainRegion> in direct reciprocal connection with <BrainRegion>CA1</BrainRegion> were presumed to be involved in the memory system, especially in the system for declarative memory.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Basal telencephalic regions</BrainRegion> connected with the <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> in a Madagascan hedgehog tenrec.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>In an attempt to gain insight into the organization and evolution of the <BrainRegion>basal forebrain</BrainRegion>, the region was analysed cytoarchitecturally, chemoarchitecturally, and hodologically in a lower placental mammal, the lesser hedgehog tenrec. Particular emphasis was laid on the subdivision of the <BrainRegion>olfactory tubercle</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>nuclear complex of the diagonal band</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>cortical amygdala</BrainRegion>. The proper tubercule and the rostrolateral tubercular seam differed from each other with regard to their immunoreactivity to calbindin and calretinin, as well as their afferents from the <BrainRegion>piriform cortex</BrainRegion>. Interestingly, the tubercular seam showed similar properties to the dwarf cell compartment, located immediately adjacent to the <BrainRegion>islands of Calleja</BrainRegion>. The most prominent input to the <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> (OfB) originated from the <BrainRegion>diagonal nuclear complex</BrainRegion>. This projection was ipsilateral, whereas the <BrainRegion>bulbar</BrainRegion> afferents from the <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>mesopontine tegmentum</BrainRegion> were bilateral. The <BrainRegion>amygdala</BrainRegion> projected only sparsely to the <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>(OfB) , but received a prominent <BrainRegion>bulbar</BrainRegion> projection. An exception was the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract</BrainRegion>, which was poorly connected with the <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>(OfB) . Unlike other species with an <BrainRegion>accessory olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>(OfB) , the projections from the tenrec&apos;s <BrainRegion>main olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>(OfB) did not show a topographic organization upon the <BrainRegion>lateral and medial olfactory amygdala</BrainRegion>. However, there was an <BrainRegion>accessory amygdala</BrainRegion>, which could be differentiated from the <BrainRegion>lateral nuclei</BrainRegion> by its intense reaction to NADPh-diaphorase. This reaction was poor in the <BrainRegion>diagonal nuclear complex</BrainRegion> as in monkey but unlike in rat. The variability of cell populations and <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> connections shown here may help to clarify both phylogenetic relationships and the significance of individual basal <BrainRegion>telencephalic</BrainRegion> subdivisions.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Light and electron microscopic evidence for projections from the <BrainRegion>thalamic nucleus rotundus</BrainRegion> to targets in the <BrainRegion>basal ganglia</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>dorsal ventricular ridge</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>amygdaloid complex</BrainRegion> in a lizard.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>To elucidate the organization and evolution of the tectorotundotelencephalic pathways in birds and reptiles, we reinvestigated at both light and electron microscopic levels the efferent projections of <BrainRegion>nucleus rotundus</BrainRegion> in a lizard, using the sensitive tracer biotinylated dextran amine. Our results indicate that <BrainRegion>nucleus rotundus</BrainRegion> projects to targets in the <BrainRegion>basal ganglia</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>lateral parts of striatum</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>olfactory tubercle</BrainRegion> and possibly the <BrainRegion>globus pallidus</BrainRegion>), the <BrainRegion>anterior dorsal ventricular ridge</BrainRegion> (ADVR), and the <BrainRegion>amygdaloid complex</BrainRegion> (the <BrainRegion>central and possibly lateral amygdaloid nuclei</BrainRegion>). In these targets, the <BrainRegion>rotundal</BrainRegion> axon terminals establish asymmetric, presumably excitatory synaptic contacts, usually with dendrites of local cells. In the <BrainRegion>anterior dorsal ventricular ridge</BrainRegion>(ADVR) , the <BrainRegion>rotundal</BrainRegion> projection terminates in two separate radial regions showing distinct cytoarchitecture: 1) a dorsolateral region that extends radially from the <BrainRegion>dorsolateral anterior dorsal ventricular ridge</BrainRegion>(ADVR) ventricular surface to the <BrainRegion>ventral part of the lateral cortex</BrainRegion> and 2) the <BrainRegion>lateral part of a ventromedial region</BrainRegion> that extends radially from the <BrainRegion>dorsomedial and medial anterior dorsal ventricular ridge</BrainRegion>(ADVR) ventricle to a superficial area interposed between the <BrainRegion>dorsolateral anterior dorsal ventricular ridge</BrainRegion>(ADVR) and the <BrainRegion>striatum</BrainRegion>. These two <BrainRegion>anterior dorsal ventricular ridge</BrainRegion>(ADVR) regions have different connections with the <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>telencephalon</BrainRegion>, which suggests that they may be involved in different degrees of integration. Our study also suggests that the <BrainRegion>rotundal</BrainRegion> projection to the <BrainRegion>ventromedial anterior dorsal ventricular ridge</BrainRegion>(ADVR) field of lizards may be comparable to the <BrainRegion>rotundoectostriatal</BrainRegion>/<BrainRegion>periectostriatal</BrainRegion> projection of birds. The connections and pathways involving <BrainRegion>nucleus rotundus</BrainRegion> suggest that this nucleus conveys visual information which may play a role in visuomotor, emotional, and visceral functions.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Monosynaptic projections from the <BrainRegion>lateral periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>nucleus retroambiguus</BrainRegion> in the rhesus monkey: implications for vocalization and reproductive behavior.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The <BrainRegion>periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion> (PAG) is known to be essential for vocalization and reproductive behavior. The <BrainRegion>periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion>(PAG) controls components of these behaviors by means of projections to the <BrainRegion>nucleus retroambiguus</BrainRegion> (NRA), a group of premotor neurons in the <BrainRegion>caudal medulla oblongata</BrainRegion>. In the accompanying study (VanderHorst et al., 2000 [accompanying study]), the <BrainRegion>nucleus retroambiguus</BrainRegion>(NRA) and its <BrainRegion>lumbosacral</BrainRegion> projections have been identified in the rhesus monkey. The present light and electron microscopical tracing study describes the <BrainRegion>periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion>(PAG) - <BrainRegion>nucleus retroambiguus</BrainRegion>(NRA) pathway in primates. To locate <BrainRegion>midbrain</BrainRegion> neurons projecting to the <BrainRegion>nucleus retroambiguus</BrainRegion>(NRA) , wheat germ agglutinin horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) was injected into the <BrainRegion>nucleus retroambiguus</BrainRegion>(NRA) in six monkeys. To determine the distribution pattern of <BrainRegion>periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion>(PAG) axons in the <BrainRegion>medulla oblongata</BrainRegion>, wheat germ agglutinin horseradish peroxidase(WGA-HRP) was injected into the <BrainRegion>periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion>(PAG) and adjacent <BrainRegion>tegmentum</BrainRegion> in three additional monkeys. In one of these three monkeys, biotinylated dextran amine and cholera toxin subunit b were injected into the <BrainRegion>lumbosacral cord</BrainRegion> to retrogradely identify <BrainRegion>nucleus retroambiguus</BrainRegion>(NRA) neurons. The results show that a compact group of neurons in the <BrainRegion>medial part of the lateral periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion>(PAG) at the intercollicular level sends a dense projection to the <BrainRegion>nucleus retroambiguus</BrainRegion>(NRA) . The projection is bilateral with a clear ipsilateral predominance. At the ultrastructural level, there are monosynaptic contacts between <BrainRegion>periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion>(PAG) fibers and <BrainRegion>nucleus retroambiguus</BrainRegion>(NRA) neurons, including <BrainRegion>nucleus retroambiguus</BrainRegion>(NRA) neurons that project to the <BrainRegion>lumbosacral cord</BrainRegion>. The synaptic contacts were primarily asymmetrical and the labeled terminal profiles contained spherical and dense core vesicles. It is concluded that there exists a strong and direct <BrainRegion>periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion>(PAG) - <BrainRegion>nucleus retroambiguus</BrainRegion>(NRA) pathway in the rhesus monkey. Because <BrainRegion>nucleus retroambiguus</BrainRegion>(NRA) neurons projecting to the <BrainRegion>lower lumbar cord</BrainRegion> are included, the <BrainRegion>periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion>(PAG) - <BrainRegion>nucleus retroambiguus</BrainRegion>(NRA) projection is likely to be involved not only in vocalization but also in other behaviors, such as receptive posture.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Neurotransmitters contained in the <BrainRegion>subcortical extraretinal</BrainRegion> inputs to the monkey <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion> (LGN) is the <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> relay of <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> information to <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion>. An extensive complement of nonretinal inputs to the <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(LGN) combine to modulate the responsiveness of relay cells to their <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> inputs, and thus control the transfer of visual information to <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion>. These inputs have been studied in the most detail in the cat. The goal of the present study was to determine whether the neurotransmitters used by nonretinal afferents to the monkey <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(LGN) are similar to those identified in the cat. By combining the retrograde transport of tracers injected into the monkey <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(LGN) with immunocytochemical labeling for choline acetyl transferase, brain nitric oxide synthase, glutamic acid decarboxylase, tyrosine hydroxylase, or the histochemical nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-diaphorase reaction, we determined that the organization of neurotransmitter inputs to the monkey <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(LGN) is strikingly similar to the patterns occurring in the cat. In particular, we found that the monkey <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(LGN) receives a significant cholinergic/nitrergic projection from the pedunculopontine <BrainRegion>tegmentum</BrainRegion>, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic projections from the <BrainRegion>thalamic reticular nucleus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>pretectum</BrainRegion>, and a cholinergic projection from the <BrainRegion>parabigeminal nucleus</BrainRegion>. The major difference between the innervation of the <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(LGN) in the cat and the monkey is the absence of a noradrenergic projection to the monkey <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(LGN) . The segregation of the noradrenergic cells and cholinergic cells in the monkey <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion> also differs from the intermingled arrangement found in the cat <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion>. Our findings suggest that studies of basic mechanisms underlying the control of visual information flow through the <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(LGN) of the cat may relate directly to similar issues in primates, and ultimately, humans.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Cells in the <BrainRegion>posterior thalamus</BrainRegion> project to both <BrainRegion>amygdala</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>temporal cortex</BrainRegion>: a quantitative retrograde double-labeling study in the rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Auditory information from the <BrainRegion>posterior thalamus</BrainRegion> reaches the <BrainRegion>lateral nucleus of the amygdala</BrainRegion> (LA) by way of two pathways: a direct thalamo-amygdala projection and a polysynaptic thalamo-cortico-amygdala projection. However, the quantitative extent of <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> neurons that project to the <BrainRegion>LA</BrainRegion> or to the <BrainRegion>auditory association cortex</BrainRegion> (AAC) is not known. Furthermore, the extent and topographical distribution of bifurcating cells that project to both <BrainRegion>LA</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>auditory association cortex</BrainRegion>(AAC) are also unknown. Therefore, separate tracers were injected into <BrainRegion>LA</BrainRegion> and either into all of <BrainRegion>audiotry association cortex</BrainRegion>(AAC) or within discrete regions of <BrainRegion>auditory association cortex</BrainRegion>(AAC) , such as temporal areas <BrainRegion>TE3</BrainRegion> or <BrainRegion>perirhinal cortex</BrainRegion> (PRh), and quantitative analyses were performed on labeling within the subregions of the <BrainRegion>auditory thalamus</BrainRegion> in rats. Following <BrainRegion>LA</BrainRegion> injections, retrogradely labeled cells were most numerous in the <BrainRegion>posterior intralaminar nucleus</BrainRegion> (PIN; 48.0% of all labeled <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> cells), whereas labeled cells following injections of the entire <BrainRegion>auditory association cortex</BrainRegion>(AAC) were most numerous in the dorsal division of the <BrainRegion>medial geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion> (MGd; 32.9% of all labeled <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> cells). Following <BrainRegion>auditory association cortex</BrainRegion>(AAC) injections localized to only <BrainRegion>TE3</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>MGd</BrainRegion> again had the majority of labeled cells (35.9%), whereas following <BrainRegion>auditory association cortex</BrainRegion>(AAC) injections localized to <BrainRegion>perirhinal cortex</BrainRegion>(PRh) , the <BrainRegion>posterior intralaminar nucleus</BrainRegion>(PIN) had the most labeled cells (32.8%). Double-labeled cells were found in all the <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> regions studied and were most commonly observed in the <BrainRegion>posterior intralaminar nucleus</BrainRegion>(PIN) (43.7% of all double-labeled cells following injections into <BrainRegion>LA</BrainRegion> and throughout the <BrainRegion>auditory association cortex</BrainRegion>(AAC) ). The percentage of double-labeled cells as a proportion of either <BrainRegion>LA</BrainRegion>-projecting or <BrainRegion>auditory association cortex</BrainRegion>(AAC) -projecting cells varied among the <BrainRegion>thalamic nuclei</BrainRegion> studied, ranging from 2.9% up to 42.4%. The topographic distribution of double-labeled cells in the <BrainRegion>thalamic nuclei</BrainRegion> resembled that of single-labeled cells following <BrainRegion>LA</BrainRegion> injections more than single-labeled cells following <BrainRegion>auditory association cortex</BrainRegion>(AAC) injection. These findings suggest that double-labeled cells contribute substantially to many of the direct thalamo-amygdala and indirect <BrainRegion>thalamo- auditory association cortex(AAC) -amygdala</BrainRegion> projections. Among other functions, these bifurcating cells may help regulate the processing of input to the <BrainRegion>LA</BrainRegion> arriving from these two pathways to allow for certain types of plasticity in the <BrainRegion>LA</BrainRegion> during fear conditioning.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Feedback connections from <BrainRegion>area MT</BrainRegion> of the squirrel monkey to <BrainRegion>areas V1</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>V2</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText><BrainRegion>Area MT/V5</BrainRegion> is reciprocally connected with both <BrainRegion>V1</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>V2</BrainRegion>; but, despite extensive anatomical and physiological investigations, detailed information on the feedback component of these connections is still not available. The present report uses serial section reconstruction of single axons, labeled by anterograde tracers injected in <BrainRegion>area MT</BrainRegion> of squirrel monkeys, to characterize these connections further. As with other feedback systems, <BrainRegion>MT</BrainRegion> axons terminating in both <BrainRegion>areas V1</BrainRegion> (n = 9) and <BrainRegion>V2</BrainRegion> (n = 6) are widely divergent. In <BrainRegion>area V1</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>MT</BrainRegion> fields are larger than those from <BrainRegion>V2</BrainRegion> and are about comparable to those from <BrainRegion>V4</BrainRegion> or <BrainRegion>TEO</BrainRegion>. Terminations in <BrainRegion>V1</BrainRegion>, unlike other feedback connections described so far, terminate in several laminar combinations: only layer 1 (n = 2); only layer 4B (n = 3); layers 1 and 4B (n = 1); and layers 1, 4B, and 6 (n = 3). In <BrainRegion>V2</BrainRegion>, they occur mainly in layers 1 and 5 or 6. Terminations have two patterns even within a single axon: strung along collateral segments and grouped within small clusters. There are no apparent differences in the size, shape, or density of terminal specializations in <BrainRegion>V1</BrainRegion> or <BrainRegion>V2</BrainRegion>, and, consistently with previous double-labeling experiments (Kennedy and Bullier [1985] J Neurosci 5:2815-2830), some axons can branch to both areas. This result, along with the laminar evidence for subtypes of feedback connections, argues against an exclusively hierarchical organization based on &quot;pairwise" connectivity. For <BrainRegion>V1</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>MT</BrainRegion>, there may be directly reciprocal loops between feedforward and feedback projecting neurons, but this is less likely to be so for <BrainRegion>V2</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>MT</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Morphology and topographical organization of the retrospleniocollicular connection: a pathway to relay contextual information from the environment to the <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The retrospleniocollicular connection is of interest because it constitutes one link between the <BrainRegion>limbic system</BrainRegion>, which is considered the anatomical substrate of emotional experience, and the <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion> (SC), which mediates approach and avoidance behavior. The morphology, topography, and origin of the retrospleniocollicular connections were studied by using anterograde [biotinylated dextranamine 10,000 (BDA)] and retrograde [Fluoro-Gold (FG)] tracers. After [biotinylated dextranamine 10,000(BDA) injections involving <BrainRegion>retrosplenial granular</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>agranular cortices</BrainRegion>, terminal fibers innervating all <BrainRegion>collicular</BrainRegion> layers except stratum griseum superficiale were found throughout nearly the entire <BrainRegion>colliculi</BrainRegion>. Axons branched within restricted portions of the <BrainRegion>dorsoventral collicular</BrainRegion> axis with variable morphologies, suggesting functional heterogeneity. Terminal fields originating in <BrainRegion>anterior and posterior regions of the retrosplenial cortex</BrainRegion> were preferentially distributed in <BrainRegion>laterodorsal and medioventral collicular regions</BrainRegion>, respectively, but there were also large, densely innervated regions in which the terminal fields overlapped. [Fluoro-Gold(FG) injections in the <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion>(SC) confirmed the retrospleniocollicular topography and demonstrated that this connection originated from layer V pyramidal cells of all <BrainRegion>retrosplenial areas</BrainRegion>. The distribution of retrospleniocollicular boutons was related to that of the AChE modules, which are associated with connections in the intermediate layers of the <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion>(SC) . In lateral portions of the <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion>(SC) intermediate layers, most retrospleniocollicular boutons were found in medium AChE stained regions, whereas in medial portions, they terminated in AChE-poor domains. The present results demonstrate that the <BrainRegion>retrosplenial cortex</BrainRegion> is the origin of a broad and dense network of axonal branches that may modulate <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion>(SC) -mediated motor and physiological responses involved in emotional behavior.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Prefrontal cortical</BrainRegion> projections to the <BrainRegion>striatum</BrainRegion> in macaque monkeys: evidence for an organization related to <BrainRegion>prefrontal</BrainRegion> networks.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The organization of projections from the <BrainRegion>prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion> (PFC) to the <BrainRegion>striatum</BrainRegion> in relation to previously defined &quot;orbital" and "medial" networks within the <BrainRegion>prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion>(PFC) were studied in monkeys using anterograde and retrograde tracing techniques. The results indicate that the orbital and medial networks connect to different <BrainRegion>striatal regions</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>ventromedial striatum</BrainRegion> (the <BrainRegion>medial caudate nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>accumbens nucleus</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>ventral putamen</BrainRegion>) receives input predominantly from the <BrainRegion>medial prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion>(PFC) (<BrainRegion>m prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion>(PFC) ) and <BrainRegion>orbital areas 12o</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>Iai</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>13a</BrainRegion>, which constitute the &quot;medial" network. More specifically, <BrainRegion>caudal medial areas 32</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>25</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>14r</BrainRegion> project to the <BrainRegion>medial edge of the caudate nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>accumbens nucleus</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>ventromedial putamen</BrainRegion>, whereas <BrainRegion>rostral areas 10o</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>10m</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>11m</BrainRegion> are restricted to the <BrainRegion>medial edge of the caudate</BrainRegion>. Projections from <BrainRegion>orbital areas 12o</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>13a</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>Iai</BrainRegion> extend more laterally into the <BrainRegion>lateral accumbens</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>ventral putamen</BrainRegion>. <BrainRegion>Area 24</BrainRegion> gives rise to a divided pattern of projections, including fibers to the <BrainRegion>ventromedial striatum</BrainRegion>, apparently from <BrainRegion>area 24b</BrainRegion>, and fibers to the <BrainRegion>dorsolateral striatum</BrainRegion>, apparently from <BrainRegion>area 24c</BrainRegion>. Other areas of <BrainRegion>orbital cortex</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>11l</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>12m</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>12l</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>13m</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>13l</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>Ial</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>Iam</BrainRegion>) that constitute the &quot;orbital" network project primarily to the <BrainRegion>central part of the rostral striatum</BrainRegion>. This region includes the <BrainRegion>central and lateral parts of the caudate nucleus</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>ventromedial putamen</BrainRegion>, on either side of the <BrainRegion>internal capsule</BrainRegion>. The results support the subdivision of the <BrainRegion>orbital and medial prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion>(PFC) into &quot;medial" and "orbital" networks and suggest that the prefrontostriatal projections reflect the functional organization of the <BrainRegion>prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion>(PFC) rather than topographic location.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Inferior parietal lobule</BrainRegion> projections to the <BrainRegion>presubiculum</BrainRegion> and neighboring <BrainRegion>ventromedial temporal cortical areas</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The <BrainRegion>entorhinal and perirhinal cortices</BrainRegion> have long been accorded a special role in the communications between <BrainRegion>neocortical areas</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>hippocampal formation</BrainRegion>. Less attention has been paid to the <BrainRegion>presubiculum</BrainRegion>, which, however, is also a component of the <BrainRegion>parahippocampal gyrus</BrainRegion>, receives dense inputs from several <BrainRegion>cortical areas</BrainRegion>, and itself is a major source of connections to the <BrainRegion>entorhinal cortex</BrainRegion> (EC). In part of a closer investigation of corticohippocampal systems, the authors applied single-axon analysis to the connections from the <BrainRegion>inferior parietal lobule</BrainRegion> (IPL) to the <BrainRegion>presubiculum</BrainRegion>. One major result from this approach was the finding that many of these axons (at least 10 of 14) branch beyond the <BrainRegion>presubiculum</BrainRegion>. For 4 axons, branches were followed to <BrainRegion>area TF</BrainRegion> and to the border between the <BrainRegion>perirhinal and entorhinal cortices</BrainRegion>, raising the suggestion that these areas, which sometimes are viewed as serial stages, are tightly interconnected. In addition, the current data identify several features of <BrainRegion>presubicular</BrainRegion> organization that may be relevant to its functional role in visuospatial or memory processes: 1) Terminations from the <BrainRegion>inferior parietal lobule</BrainRegion>(IPL) , as previously reported for <BrainRegion>prefrontal</BrainRegion> connections (Goldman-Rakic et al. [1984] Neuroscience 12:719-743), form two to four patches in the superficial layers. These align in stripes, but only for short distances ( approximately 1.5 mm). This pattern suggests a strong compartmentalization in layers I and II that is also indicated by cytochrome oxidase and other markers. 2) Connections tend to be bistratified, terminating in layers I-II and deeper in layer III. 3) Single axons terminate in layer I alone or in different combinations of layers. This may imply some heterogeneity of subtypes. 4) Individual axons, both ipsilateral projecting (n = 14 axons) and contralateral projecting (n = 6 axons), tend to have large arbors (0.3-0.8 mm across). Finally, the authors observe that projections from the <BrainRegion>inferior parietal lobule</BrainRegion>(IPL) , except for its anteriormost portion, converge at the <BrainRegion>perirhinal-entorhinal border</BrainRegion> around the <BrainRegion>posterior tip of the rhinal sulcus</BrainRegion>. These projections partially overlap with projections from <BrainRegion>ventromedial areas TE</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>TF</BrainRegion>, and this convergence may contribute to the severe deficits in visual recognition memory resulting from ablations of <BrainRegion>rhinal cortex</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Pretectal</BrainRegion> connections in turtles with special reference to the <BrainRegion>visual thalamic centers</BrainRegion>: a hodological and gamma-aminobutyric acid-immunohistochemical study.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Projections of the <BrainRegion>pretectal region</BrainRegion> to <BrainRegion>forebrain</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>midbrain</BrainRegion> structures were examined in two species of turtles (Testudo horsfieldi and Emys orbicularis) by axonal tracing and immunocytochemical methods. Two ascending gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic pathways to <BrainRegion>thalamic visual centers</BrainRegion> were revealed: a weak projection from the <BrainRegion>retinorecipient nucleus lentiformis mesencephali</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral nucleus geniculatus lateralis pars dorsalis</BrainRegion> and a considerably stronger projection from the <BrainRegion>nonretinorecipient nucleus pretectalis ventralis</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>nucleus rotundus</BrainRegion>. The latter is primarily ipsilateral, with a weak contralateral component. The <BrainRegion>interstitial nucleus of the tectothalamic tract</BrainRegion> is also involved in reciprocal projections of the <BrainRegion>pretectum</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>nucleus rotundus</BrainRegion>. In addition, the <BrainRegion>pretectal nuclei</BrainRegion> project reciprocally to the <BrainRegion>optic tectum</BrainRegion> and possibly to the <BrainRegion>telencephalic isocortical homologues</BrainRegion>. Comparison of these findings with previous work on other species reveals striking similarities between the <BrainRegion>pretectorotundal</BrainRegion> pathway in turtles and birds and in the <BrainRegion>pretectogeniculate</BrainRegion> pathway in turtles, birds, and mammals.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Overlapping corticostriatal projections from the rodent vibrissal representations in <BrainRegion>primary and secondary somatosensory cortex</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>To determine whether the <BrainRegion>neostriatum</BrainRegion> receives overlapping projections from two <BrainRegion>somatosensory cortical areas</BrainRegion>, the anterograde tracers biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) and fluoro-ruby (FR) were injected into the whisker representations of primary (<BrainRegion>SI</BrainRegion>) and secondary (<BrainRegion>SII</BrainRegion>) <BrainRegion>somatosensory cortex</BrainRegion>. Reconstructions of labeled terminals and their beaded varicosities in the <BrainRegion>neostriatum</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion> were analyzed quantitatively to compare the extent of overlapping projections to both <BrainRegion>subcortical</BrainRegion> structures. Corticostriatal projections from focal sites in both <BrainRegion>somatosensory areas</BrainRegion> exhibited substantial amounts of divergence within the <BrainRegion>dorsolateral neostriatum</BrainRegion>. Most of the labeled terminals were concentrated in densely packed arborizations that occupied lamellar-shaped regions along the <BrainRegion>dorsolateral edge of the neostriatum</BrainRegion>. Tracer injections in both <BrainRegion>cortical areas</BrainRegion> also produced dense anterograde and retrograde labeling in the <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion>, especially in the <BrainRegion>ventrobasal complex</BrainRegion> (VB) and in the <BrainRegion>medial part of the posterior (POm) nucleus</BrainRegion>. Because these <BrainRegion>thalamic regions</BrainRegion> are topographically organized and have reciprocal connections with corresponding representations in both <BrainRegion>SI</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>SII</BrainRegion>, the amount of labeled overlap in the <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion> was used to indicate the degree of somatotopic correspondence at the <BrainRegion>SI</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>SII</BrainRegion> injection sites. We found that the proportion of overlapping projections to the <BrainRegion>neostriatum</BrainRegion> was moderately correlated with the amount of overlap observed in the <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion>. This result strongly indicates that specific sites in the <BrainRegion>dorsolateral neostriatum</BrainRegion> receive convergent projections from corresponding somatotopic representations in <BrainRegion>SI</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>SII</BrainRegion>, but also suggests that some of the corticostriatal divergence may reflect <BrainRegion>neostriatal</BrainRegion> integration of somatosensory information from noncorresponding representations in <BrainRegion>SI</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>SII</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Projections from the <BrainRegion>medial geniculate body</BrainRegion> to <BrainRegion>primary auditory cortex</BrainRegion> in neonatally deafened cats.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>In the present study, anatomical projections from the <BrainRegion>medial geniculate body</BrainRegion> (MGB) to <BrainRegion>primary auditory cortex</BrainRegion> (AI) were investigated in normal adult cats and in animals that were neonatally deafened with the ototoxic drug amikacin. Cochleotopic/tonotopic maps in <BrainRegion>auditory cortex</BrainRegion>(AI) (based on neural response characteristic frequency) were obtained with microelectrode recording techniques, and single or multiple injections of retrograde tracers (horseradish peroxidase and fluorescent dyes) were introduced into <BrainRegion>auditory cortex</BrainRegion>(AI) . The <BrainRegion>auditory cortex</BrainRegion>(AI) maps of the amikacin-treated cats had an abnormal cochleotopic organization, such that deprived <BrainRegion>cortical areas</BrainRegion> exhibited an expanded representation of intact regions of the damaged <BrainRegion>cochlea</BrainRegion>. However, retrograde tracer injections into different regions of <BrainRegion>auditory cortex</BrainRegion>(AI) produced a normal pattern of labeling in the <BrainRegion>ventral division of the medial geniculate body</BrainRegion> ( medial geniculate body(MGB) v). In both experimental and control animals, the main mass of labeled <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> cells was found in the <BrainRegion>medial geniculate body</BrainRegion>(MGB) v. Different isofrequency contours in <BrainRegion>auditory cortex</BrainRegion>(AI) receive input from different portions of the <BrainRegion>medial geniculate body</BrainRegion>(MGB) v. Thus, cell arrays labeled by <BrainRegion>anterior auditory cortex</BrainRegion>(AI) injections were situated medially in <BrainRegion>medial geniculate body</BrainRegion>(MGB) v, and injections into <BrainRegion>posterior auditory cortex</BrainRegion>(AI) labeled <BrainRegion>medial geniculate body</BrainRegion>(MGB) v more laterally. Furthermore, the deafened cats did not develop a more divergent thalamocortical projection compared with normal control animals, indicating that an abnormal spread of the thalamocortical afferents across the frequency domain in <BrainRegion>auditory cortex</BrainRegion>(AI) (anterior-posterior axis) is not responsible for the altered cochleotopic map in these neonatally deafened animals. The relatively normal thalamocortical projection pattern suggests that, after neonatal <BrainRegion>cochlear</BrainRegion> lesions, the major reorganization of cochleotopic maps occurs at <BrainRegion>subthalamic</BrainRegion> levels.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Organization of projections from the <BrainRegion>inferior olive</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>cerebellar nuclei</BrainRegion> in the rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The detailed organization of projections from the <BrainRegion>inferior olive</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>cerebellar nuclei</BrainRegion> of the rat was studied by using anterograde tracing. The presence of a collateral projection to the <BrainRegion>cerebellar nuclei</BrainRegion> could be confirmed, and a detailed organization was recognized at the nuclear and subnuclear level. <BrainRegion>Olivary</BrainRegion> projections to the different parts of the <BrainRegion>medial cerebellar nucleus</BrainRegion> arise from various parts of the caudal half of the <BrainRegion>medial accessory olivary nucleus</BrainRegion>. The interstitial cell groups receive <BrainRegion>olivary</BrainRegion> afferents from the <BrainRegion>intermediate part of the medial accessory olive</BrainRegion> and from the dorsomedial cell column. A mediolateral topography was noted in the projections from the <BrainRegion>rostral half of the medial accessory olive</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>posterior interposed nucleus</BrainRegion>. <BrainRegion>Olivary</BrainRegion> projections to the <BrainRegion>lateral cerebellar nucleus</BrainRegion> are derived from the <BrainRegion>principal olive</BrainRegion> according to basically inversed rostrocaudal topography. Projections from the <BrainRegion>dorsomedial group of the principal olive</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>dorsolateral hump</BrainRegion> were found to follow a basically rostrocaudal topography. The <BrainRegion>anterior interposed nucleus</BrainRegion> receives <BrainRegion>olivary</BrainRegion> afferents from the <BrainRegion>dorsal accessory olive</BrainRegion>. Its rostromedial parts are directed to the <BrainRegion>lateral part of the anterior interposed nucleus</BrainRegion> and its caudolateral part reach the <BrainRegion>medial anterior interposed nucleus</BrainRegion>. No terminal arborizations in the <BrainRegion>cerebellar nuclei</BrainRegion> were found to originate from (1) the dorsal fold of the <BrainRegion>dorsal accessory olive</BrainRegion>, which resulted in projections to the <BrainRegion>lateral vestibular nucleus</BrainRegion> and (2) the <BrainRegion>dorsal cap of Kooy</BrainRegion>. It was noted that the <BrainRegion>olivary</BrainRegion> projection to the <BrainRegion>cerebellar nuclei</BrainRegion> is strictly reciprocal to the <BrainRegion>nucleo-olivary</BrainRegion> projection as described by Ruigrok and Voogd (1990). Moreover, it is suggested that the <BrainRegion>olivonuclear</BrainRegion> projection adheres to the organization of the climbing fiber projection to the <BrainRegion>cerebellar cortex</BrainRegion> and to the corticonuclear projection, thus, establishing and extending the detailed micromodular organization of the connections between <BrainRegion>inferior olive</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>cerebellum</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Study of projections from the <BrainRegion>entopeduncular nucleus</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion> of the rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The <BrainRegion>entopeduncular nucleus</BrainRegion> (EP) is a major outflow nucleus of the <BrainRegion>basal ganglia</BrainRegion> and innervates the <BrainRegion>lateral habenula</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>parafascicular</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>pedunculopontine</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>ventrolateral</BrainRegion> (VL), <BrainRegion>ventromedial</BrainRegion> (VM), and <BrainRegion>mediodorsal thalamic nuclei</BrainRegion>. This study investigated the morphology of single axons of <BrainRegion>entopeduncular neurons</BrainRegion> projecting to the <BrainRegion>motor thalamus</BrainRegion> by placing small injections of dextran biotin into the <BrainRegion>entopeduncular nucleus</BrainRegion>(EP) and reconstructing drawings of single axons from serial sections. There were two populations of entopeduncular-thalamic projection axons: those that projected only to the <BrainRegion>motor thalamus</BrainRegion> ( <BrainRegion>ventrolateral</BrainRegion>(VL) and <BrainRegion>ventromedial</BrainRegion>(VM) ) and those that projected to both the <BrainRegion>motor thalamus</BrainRegion> and other <BrainRegion>nuclei</BrainRegion> (e.g., the <BrainRegion>habenula</BrainRegion>). The neurochemistry of <BrainRegion>entopeduncular nucleus</BrainRegion>(EP) neurons projecting to the <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion> was investigated by injecting the retrograde tracer FluoroGold into the <BrainRegion>ventrolateral</BrainRegion>(VL) and <BrainRegion>ventromedial</BrainRegion>(VM) <BrainRegion>thalamic nuclei</BrainRegion> to retrogradely fill <BrainRegion>entopeduncular</BrainRegion> projection neurons. These were subsequently immunohistochemically labeled for choline acetyl transferase, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and glutamate. Consistent with previous studies, significant proportions of these neurons were gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) immunoreactive. In addition, approximately half of the entopeduncular-thalamic projecting neurons were found to be cholinergic. This excitatory input is most likely derived from axons that branch as they pass through the <BrainRegion>motor thalamus</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>lateral habenula</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Extranuclear projections of <BrainRegion>rNST</BrainRegion> neurons expressing gustatory-elicited Fos.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Previous studies have demonstrated that gustatory stimulation evokes expression of the immediate-early gene, c-fos in the <BrainRegion>rostral division of the nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion> (rNST) (Harrer and Travers [1996] Brain Res. 711:125-137; DiNardo and Travers [1997] J. Neurosci. 17:3826-3839; King et al. [1999] J. Neurosci. 19:3107-3121). The present investigation further defined the phenotype of those neurons by determining their projections, by using immunohistochemistry for the Fos protein and retrograde tracing with Fluoro-Gold. Tracer injections were made into the two major <BrainRegion>extranuclear targets of rNST</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>parabrachial nucleus</BrainRegion> (PBN) and <BrainRegion>medullary reticular formation</BrainRegion> (RF). These structures are thought to play differential roles in higher-order discriminative and homeostatic ( <BrainRegion>parabrachial nucleus</BrainRegion>(PBN) ) versus <BrainRegion>medullary reticular formation</BrainRegion> ( reflexive function(RF) ). After <BrainRegion>parabrachial nucleus</BrainRegion>(PBN) injections, approximately 18% of the Fos-like immunoreactive (FLI) neurons were double-labeled; after <BrainRegion>medullary reticular formation</BrainRegion>(RF) injections the proportion was 9%. Because only a minority of Fos-like immunoreactive(FLI) neurons appear to project to targets outside <BrainRegion>NST</BrainRegion>, this suggests that most of these cells have local, intranuclear projections. Comparable proportions of cells were double-labeled after sucrose or quinine, consistent with roles for both tastants in higher-order and reflexive function. On the other hand, regardless of stimulus, twice as many Fos-like immunoreactive(FLI) neurons projected to the <BrainRegion>parabrachial nucleus</BrainRegion>(PBN) as to the <BrainRegion>medullary reticular formation</BrainRegion> (RF) . This could suggest that more Fos-like immunoreactive(FLI) neurons contribute to functions mediated by the ascending pathway. However, the results of a recent study prompted a different hypothesis: Because glossopharyngeal nerve section similarly devastates quinine-induced Fos-like immunoreactive(FLI) and oral rejection but leaves discriminative function unimpaired, it was proposed that Fos-like immunoreactive(FLI) neurons are more important in driving oral motor behavior than discrimination (King et al. [1999] J. Neurosci. 19:3107-3121). A plausible hypothesis for reconciling this apparent discrepancy is that many Fos-like immunoreactive(FLI) neurons make local projections in <BrainRegion>rNST</BrainRegion>, that in turn give rise to <BrainRegion>medullary reticular formation</BrainRegion> (RF) connections.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Relationship between <BrainRegion>vestibular primary afferents</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>vestibulospinal</BrainRegion> neurons in lampreys.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The distribution of <BrainRegion>vestibular primary afferents</BrainRegion> as well as their relationship with <BrainRegion>vestibulospinal</BrainRegion> and other <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion> neurons were studied in lampreys using anatomical tracers. Afferents from the anterior (<BrainRegion>aVIIIn</BrainRegion>) and the posterior (<BrainRegion>pVIIIn</BrainRegion>) branches of the <BrainRegion>vestibular nerve</BrainRegion> were located mainly in the <BrainRegion>ventral nucleus of the octavolateral area</BrainRegion>. The relationship between afferents and <BrainRegion>vestibulospinal</BrainRegion> neurons was studied by applying one fluorescent tracer to the whole <BrainRegion>vestibular nerve</BrainRegion> or one of its branches and applying another tracer to the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>. Some afferents showed large, bulb-like enlargements (bulbs) and about 20 of these were found in the <BrainRegion>anterior and the intermediate octavomotor nucleus</BrainRegion>, whereas about 40 were found in the <BrainRegion>posterior octavomotor nucleus</BrainRegion>. Some of the bulb-like enlargements(bulbs) made apparent contact with <BrainRegion>vestibulospinal</BrainRegion> neurons in the <BrainRegion>intermediate octavomotor nucleus</BrainRegion> and originated mostly from the <BrainRegion>aVIIIn</BrainRegion>, whereas bulb-like enlargements(bulbs) in the <BrainRegion>posterior octavomotor nucleus</BrainRegion> originated from the <BrainRegion>pVIIIn</BrainRegion>. Applications of biocytin to hemisegments of <BrainRegion>rostral spinal cord</BrainRegion> labeled vestibulospinal neurons located in the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral intermediate octavomotor nucleus</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>contralateral posterior octavomotor nucleus</BrainRegion>. In addition, <BrainRegion>vestibular primary afferents</BrainRegion> with bulb-like enlargements(bulbs) in apparent contact with <BrainRegion>vestibulospinal</BrainRegion> neurons were transneuronally labeled by biocytin. They were observed in the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral aVIIIn</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>contralateral pVIIIn</BrainRegion> and could be followed in the labyrinths, where they innervated the vertical and horizontal arms of the <BrainRegion>semicircular canal</BrainRegion> crests. Taken together, these results indicate that <BrainRegion>vestibular primary afferents</BrainRegion> from the <BrainRegion>aVIIIn</BrainRegion> innervate predominantly <BrainRegion>vestibulospinal</BrainRegion> neurons of the <BrainRegion>intermediate octavomotor nucleus</BrainRegion>, whereas afferents from the <BrainRegion>pVIIIn</BrainRegion> innervate vestibulospinal neurons in the <BrainRegion>posterior octavomotor nucleus</BrainRegion>. This anatomical organization suggests that afferents carrying bulb-like enlargements(bulbs) convey dynamic information to <BrainRegion>vestibulospinal neurons</BrainRegion>, which, in turn, project to the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> networks.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Auditory thalamocortical projections in the cat: laminar and areal patterns of input.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Thalamocortical projections were studied in adult cats using biotinylated dextran amines, wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, and autoradiography with tritiated leucine and/or proline. The input from 7 architectonically defined nuclei to 14 <BrainRegion>auditory cortical fields</BrainRegion> was characterized qualitatively and quantitatively. The principal results were that 1) every <BrainRegion>thalamic nucleus</BrainRegion> projected to more than 1 field (range, 4-14 fields; mean, 7 fields); 2) only the projection from the ventral division to some primary fields (<BrainRegion>primary auditory cortex</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>posterior auditory cortex</BrainRegion>) had a periodic, clustered distribution, whereas the input from other divisions to nonprimary areas was continuous; 3) layers III-V received &amp;gt;85% of the total axonal profiles; 4) in most experiments, five or more layers were labeled; 5) the projections to nonprimary auditory areas had many laterally oriented axons; 6) the heaviest input to layer I in all experiments was usually in its upper half, suggesting a sublaminar arrangement; 7) the largest axonal trunks (up to 6 microm in diameter) arose from the medial division and ended in layer Ia, where they ran laterally for long distances; 8) there were three projection patterns: type 1 had its peak in layers III-IV with little input to layer I, and it arose from the ventral division and the <BrainRegion>dorsal superficial, dorsal, and suprageniculate nuclei</BrainRegion> of the dorsal division; type 2 had heavy labeling in layer I and less in layers III-IV, arising from the <BrainRegion>dorsal division nuclei</BrainRegion> primarily, especially the <BrainRegion>caudal dorsal and deep dorsal nuclei</BrainRegion>; and type 3 was a trimodal concentration in layers I, III-IV, and VI that originated chiefly in the medial division and had the lowest density of labeling; and 9) the quantitative profiles with the three methods were very similar. The results suggest that the subdivisions of the <BrainRegion>auditory thalamus</BrainRegion> have consistent patterns of laminar distribution to different <BrainRegion>cortical areas</BrainRegion>, that an average of five or more layers receive significant input in a specific area, that a given <BrainRegion>thalamic nucleus</BrainRegion> can influence areas as far as 20 mm apart, that the first information to arrive at the <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion> may reach layer I by virtue of the giant axons, and that several laminar patterns of auditory thalamocortical projection exist. The view that the <BrainRegion>auditory thalamus</BrainRegion> (and perhaps other <BrainRegion>thalamic nuclei</BrainRegion>) serves mainly a relay function underestimates its many modes for influencing the <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion> on a laminar basis.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Periaqueductal gray neurons</BrainRegion> monosynaptically innervate extranuclear noradrenergic dendrites in the rat <BrainRegion>pericoerulear region</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Previous reports using light microscopy have provided anatomical evidence that neurons in the <BrainRegion>ventrolateral periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion> (PAG) innervate the medial pericoerulear dendrites of noradrenergic neurons in the <BrainRegion>nucleus locus coeruleus</BrainRegion> (LC). The present study used anterograde tracing and electron microscopic analysis to provide more definitive evidence that neurons in the <BrainRegion>ventrolateral periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion>(PAG) form synapses with the somata or dendrites of noradrenergic <BrainRegion>locus coeruleus</BrainRegion>(LC) neurons. Deposits of either biotinylated dextran amine or Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin into the rat <BrainRegion>ventrolateral periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion>(PAG) labeled a moderate to high number of axons in the region of the <BrainRegion>medial pericoerulear region</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>Barrington&apos;s nucleus</BrainRegion>, but a relatively low number were labeled in the nuclear core of the <BrainRegion>locus coeruleus</BrainRegion>(LC) . Ultrastructural analysis of anterogradely labeled terminals at the levels of the rostral (n = 233) and caudal (n = 272) subdivisions of the <BrainRegion>locus coeruleus</BrainRegion>(LC) indicated that approximately 20% of these form synapses with tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive dendrites; most of these were located in the <BrainRegion>medial pericoerulear region</BrainRegion>. In rostral sections, about 12% of these were symmetric synapses, 9% were asymmetric synapses, and 79% were membrane appositions without clear synaptic specializations. In caudal sections, about 30% were symmetric synapses, 11% were asymmetric synapses, and 59% were appositions. In both rostral and caudal sections, 60% of the anterogradely labeled terminals formed synapses with noncatecholamine dendrites, and 20% formed axoaxonic synapses. These results provide direct evidence for monosynaptic projections from neurons in the <BrainRegion>ventrolateral periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion>(PAG) to the extranuclear dendrites of noradrenergic <BrainRegion>locus coeruleus</BrainRegion>(LC) neurons. This monosynaptic pathway may mediate in part the analgesia, reduced responsiveness to external stimuli, and decreased excitability of somatic motoneurons produced by stimulation of neurons in the <BrainRegion>ventrolateral periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion>(PAG) .</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Corticocortical connections of visual, sensorimotor, and multimodal processing areas in the <BrainRegion>parietal lobe</BrainRegion> of the macaque monkey.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>We studied the corticocortical connections of architectonically defined areas of <BrainRegion>parietal</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>temporoparietal cortex</BrainRegion>, with emphasis on areas in the <BrainRegion>intraparietal sulcus</BrainRegion> (IPS) that are implicated in visual and somatosensory integration. Retrograde tracers were injected into selected areas of the <BrainRegion>intraparietal sulcus</BrainRegion>(IPS) , <BrainRegion>superior temporal sulcus</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>parietal lobule</BrainRegion>. The distribution of labeled cells was charted in relation to architectonically defined borders throughout the hemisphere and displayed on computer-generated three-dimensional reconstructions and on cortical flat maps. Injections centered in the <BrainRegion>ventral intraparietal area</BrainRegion> (VIP) revealed a complex pattern of inputs from numerous <BrainRegion>visual, somatosensory, motor, and polysensory areas</BrainRegion>, and from presumed <BrainRegion>vestibular- and auditory-related areas</BrainRegion>. Sensorimotor projections were predominantly from the upper body representations of at least six somatotopically organized areas. In contrast, injections centered in the neighboring <BrainRegion>ventral lateral intraparietal area</BrainRegion> (LIPv) revealed inputs mainly from <BrainRegion>extrastriate visual areas</BrainRegion>, consistent with previous studies. The pattern of inputs to <BrainRegion>LIPv</BrainRegion> largely overlapped those to zone <BrainRegion>MSTdp</BrainRegion>, a newly described subdivision of the <BrainRegion>medial superior temporal area</BrainRegion>. These results, in conjunction with those from injections into other <BrainRegion>parietal areas</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>7a</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>7b</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>anterior intraparietal area</BrainRegion>), support the fine-grained architectonic partitioning of <BrainRegion>cortical areas</BrainRegion> described in the preceding study. They also support and extend previous evidence for multiple distributed networks that are implicated in multimodal integration, especially with regard to area <BrainRegion>ventral intraparietal area</BrainRegion>(VIP) .</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Olfactory</BrainRegion> projections in a chondrostean fish, Acipenser baeri: an experimental study.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The presence of <BrainRegion>extrabulbar primary olfactory</BrainRegion> projections has been well established in teleosts. In order to investigate the phylogeny of these projections and to compare their targets with those of the <BrainRegion>secondary olfactory</BrainRegion> projections, the connections of the <BrainRegion>olfactory epithelium</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> were studied by means of tract-tracing methods in a chondrostean, Acipenser baeri. <BrainRegion>Primary olfactory</BrainRegion> projections mainly extend to the <BrainRegion>glomerular layer of the olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>, but a significant number of <BrainRegion>extrabulbar efferent fibers</BrainRegion> course to various <BrainRegion>telencephalic</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>diencephalic regions</BrainRegion>. Both <BrainRegion>extrabulbar primary</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> projections course in diffuse pathways. Extensive overlap was observed between the targets of these <BrainRegion>extrabulbar primary olfactory</BrainRegion> fibers and those of the secondary efferent projections of the <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>, though the latter were more numerous and reached additional targets. Tracer application to the <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> also revealed a number of bulbopetal neurons in the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral and contralateral telencephalic areas</BrainRegion>, as well as crossed interbulbar projections. The presence in a chondrostean of important <BrainRegion>extrabulbar primary</BrainRegion> projections and their extensive overlap with <BrainRegion>secondary olfactory</BrainRegion> projections suggest that such projections are a derived characteristic of bony fishes.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Parabrachial nucleus</BrainRegion> projections to midline and <BrainRegion>intralaminar thalamic nuclei</BrainRegion> of the rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The projections from the <BrainRegion>parabrachial nucleus</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>midline and intralaminar thalamic nuclei</BrainRegion> were examined in the rat. Stereotaxic injections of the retrograde tracer cholera toxin-beta (CTb) were made in each of the <BrainRegion>intralaminar nuclei of the dorsal thalamus</BrainRegion> (the <BrainRegion>lateral parafascicular</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>medial parafascicular</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>oval paracentral</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>central lateral</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>paracentral</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>central medial nuclei</BrainRegion>), as well as the <BrainRegion>midline thalamic nuclei</BrainRegion> (the <BrainRegion>paraventricular</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>intermediodorsal</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>mediodorsal</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>paratenial</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>rhomboid</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>reuniens</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>parvicellular part of the ventral posterior</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>caudal ventral medial nuclei</BrainRegion>). The retrograde cell body labeling pattern within the <BrainRegion>parabrachial subnuclei</BrainRegion> was then analyzed. The <BrainRegion>paracentral thalamic nucleus</BrainRegion> received an input only from the <BrainRegion>internal lateral parabrachial subnucleus</BrainRegion>. However, this subnucleus also projected to all the other <BrainRegion>intralaminar thalamic nuclei</BrainRegion>, except for the <BrainRegion>central lateral thalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>, which received no <BrainRegion>parabrachial</BrainRegion> afferent inputs. The <BrainRegion>external lateral parabrachial subnucleus</BrainRegion> projected to the <BrainRegion>lateral parafascicular</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>reuniens</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>central medial</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>parvicellular part of the ventral posterior</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>caudal ventromedial thalamic nuclei</BrainRegion>. Following cholera toxin-beta(CTb) injections in the <BrainRegion>paraventricular thalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>, retrogradely labeled cells were found in the <BrainRegion>central lateral</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>dorsal lateral</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>external lateral parabrachial subnuclei</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>medial and ventral lateral parabrachial subnuclei</BrainRegion> projected to the <BrainRegion>oval paracentral</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>parafascicular</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>rhomboid thalamic nuclei</BrainRegion>. Finally, the waist area of the <BrainRegion>parabrachial nucleus</BrainRegion> was densely labeled after cholera toxin-beta(CTb) injections in the <BrainRegion>parvicellular part of the ventral posterior thalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>. Nociceptive, visceral, and gustatory signals may reach specific cortical and other <BrainRegion>forebrain</BrainRegion> sites via this parabrachial-thalamic pathway.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Postnatal development of thalamocortical projections upon <BrainRegion>striate and extrastriate visual cortical areas</BrainRegion> in the cat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The development of visual thalamocortical projections was analyzed quantitatively by comparing, in cresyl violet-stained brain sections of early postnatal (10-17 days) and adult cats, the cell body dimensions and total cell packing density (CPD) of neuronal populations in different laminae (A, A1 and C) of the <BrainRegion>dorsal lateral geniculate</BrainRegion> (dLGN), <BrainRegion>medial interlaminar nucleus</BrainRegion> (MIN), and in <BrainRegion>lateral (LPl), intermediate (LPi) and medial (LPm) subdivisions of the lateral posterior complex</BrainRegion>. Following injections of different fluorescent tracers (FB, NY, EB, RITC) into <BrainRegion>cortical visual areas 17/18</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>posterior medial (PMLS) and posterior lateral (PLLS) lateral suprasylvian</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>anterior ectosylvian</BrainRegion> (AEV), the <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> distribution and densities of retrogradely labeled neurons were analyzed. Projection cell packing density(CPD) s and ratios of projection/total cell packing density(CPD) s were determined and compared within the different <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> components in the kitten and adult cat. A significant decrease in total cell packing density was observed in the various <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> components of the adult cat, varying between 43% and 65%, and a marked increase in mean cell body diameter in the A, A1 and C laminae and <BrainRegion>medial interlaminar nucleus</BrainRegion>(MIN) from kitten to adult (8.4+/-1.8 and 11.8+/-2.8 microm respectively) compared to the <BrainRegion>LP subnuclei</BrainRegion> (9.0+/-1.3 and 9.1+/-1.5 microm). The ratios of projection/total cell packing density(CPD) s decreased significantly for projections upon <BrainRegion>areas 17/18</BrainRegion> stemming from layers A and A1 (20 and 25%, respectively) and from <BrainRegion>LPi</BrainRegion> upon both <BrainRegion>PMLS</BrainRegion> (34%) and <BrainRegion>anterior ectosylvian</BrainRegion>(AEV) (16%). Thalamocortical projections observed in the kitten from <BrainRegion>LPi</BrainRegion> upon <BrainRegion>areas 17/18</BrainRegion> and from the A-laminae upon <BrainRegion>PMLS</BrainRegion> were absent in the adult cat. The data indicate that, in comparison to the <BrainRegion>lateral posterior nucleus</BrainRegion>, the maturation of neurons within the <BrainRegion>dorsal lateral geniculate</BrainRegion>(dLGN) and <BrainRegion>medial interlaminar nucleus</BrainRegion>(MIN) is incomplete with respect to cell body size during the early postnatal period. In addition, the developmental changes observed involve both reductions in the total number of <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> neurons and a differential loss of <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> projections. The selective elimination of early <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> connections stemming from <BrainRegion>dorsal lateral geniculate</BrainRegion> laminae A and A1 and from the <BrainRegion>intermediate division of the lateral posterior nucleus</BrainRegion> may occur through a process of axon collateral withdrawal from the expanded <BrainRegion>cortical sites</BrainRegion>, thereby giving rise to the adult pattern.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>[The neuronal organization of the <BrainRegion>limbic</BrainRegion> (cingulo-)-visceral reflex arc]</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The paper summarizes new electrophysiological data concerning the structural-functional organization of the <BrainRegion>limbic cortex</BrainRegion> and role of the <BrainRegion>rostral limbic region</BrainRegion> of visceral functions. Here are presented the results of a series of electrophysiological investigation of the focus of localization in the <BrainRegion>supracallosal</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>area 24</BrainRegion>) and <BrainRegion>infracallosal</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>area 25</BrainRegion>) part of the <BrainRegion>anterior cingulate gyrus</BrainRegion> of evoked potentials of maximal amplitude and minimal latent period to stimulation of pelvic, splanchnic and sciatic nerves. It was shown that evoked potentials of maximal amplitude and minimal latent periods to stimulation of viscero-somatic nerves are recorded in the <BrainRegion>supragenual area 24</BrainRegion> in comparison with the <BrainRegion>infragenual area 25</BrainRegion> of the <BrainRegion>anterior limbic cortex</BrainRegion>. In a series of microelectrophysiological studies of reactions of neurons of <BrainRegion>area 24</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>25</BrainRegion> it was established that the reactivity of neurons of <BrainRegion>area 24</BrainRegion> is higher than that of <BrainRegion>area 25</BrainRegion>. All these data indicate to the leading role of <BrainRegion>area 24</BrainRegion> in reception and treatment of viscero-somatic afferent signals. In series of experiments it was shown that the focus of exciting neurons, forming the descending singular-autonomic discharge is localized in the <BrainRegion>infragenual area 25</BrainRegion> of <BrainRegion>anterior limbic cortex</BrainRegion>. In a study of the comparative characteristics of sympathetic responses in lumbar white communicating rami and parasympathetic responses in pelvic nerve it was shown that evoked potentials in pelvic nerve and white rami had the lowest threshold and shorter latency in case of stimulation of <BrainRegion>area 25</BrainRegion>. Study of characteristics of influence of dorsal (<BrainRegion>area 24</BrainRegion>) and ventral (<BrainRegion>area 25</BrainRegion>) regions of <BrainRegion>rostral limbic cortex</BrainRegion> on bioelectrical activity of two postganglionic sympathetic nerves-inferior cardiac and vertebral branches of stellate ganglion, innervating coronary vessels and vessels of anterior extremities correspondingly, showed that stimulation of <BrainRegion>ventral area 25</BrainRegion> evoked increase of electrical activity of the two sympathetic nerves and reliable increase of systemic arterial pressure, while stimulation of <BrainRegion>dorsal area 24</BrainRegion> evoked decrease of tonic activity of the two sympathetic nerves and reliable decrease of systemic arterial pressure. In the paper are presented also the results of microelectrophysiological investigation of peculiarities of reactions of inspiratory and expiratory neurons of bulbar respiratory center to high frequency stimulation of <BrainRegion>area 24</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>25</BrainRegion>--in case of stimulation of <BrainRegion>dorsal area 24</BrainRegion> the prevailing effect is suppression of spike activity of neurons, of stimulation of <BrainRegion>ventral, infragenual area 25</BrainRegion> the prevailing influence is excitatory. In another series of microelectrophysiological experiments it was shown downward blocking inhibitory influence of <BrainRegion>dorsal supragenual area 24 of anterior limbic cortex</BrainRegion> on activity of vagal viscerosensory neurons of <BrainRegion>bulbar solitary tract nucleus</BrainRegion>. It is concluded that the strictly connected one another <BrainRegion>areas 24 and 25 of limbic cortex</BrainRegion> are functionally differentiated: the <BrainRegion>infra-limbic cortex</BrainRegion> is mainly a <BrainRegion>viscero-motor cortex</BrainRegion>, while the <BrainRegion>prelimbic area 24</BrainRegion> plays a leading role in reception and treatment of viscero-somatic afferent information.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Direct pathways to the <BrainRegion>supraoptic nucleus</BrainRegion> from the <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>main olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> are activated at parturition in the rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Sensory input from female reproductive structures is paramount for the co-ordination of neuroendocrine changes at parturition. Using a retrograde tracer (fluorescent latex microspheres) in combination with Fos (as an indicator of neuronal activation) and tyrosine hydroxylase (to identify catecholaminergic neurons) immunocytochemistry we identified cells within the <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>main olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> that project to the <BrainRegion>supraoptic nucleus</BrainRegion>, and which become significantly activated at parturition (compared to virgin rats and rats on the day of expected parturition). Within the <BrainRegion>A2/C2 region in the nucleus tractus solitarii</BrainRegion>, 60% of the projecting activated cells were catecholaminergic, as were 59% of such cells in the <BrainRegion>A1/C1 region of the ventrolateral medulla</BrainRegion>. This suggests that oxytocin and vasopressin neurons within the <BrainRegion>supraoptic nucleus</BrainRegion> are stimulated at parturition via afferent inputs from the <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion>, but the input is not exclusively noradrenergic. Within the mitral layer of the <BrainRegion>main olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>, cells that projected to the <BrainRegion>supraoptic nucleus</BrainRegion> were significantly activated, suggesting that the <BrainRegion>olfactory system</BrainRegion> may regulate <BrainRegion>supraoptic nucleus</BrainRegion> cell firing at parturition. The <BrainRegion>preoptic area</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>medial amygdala</BrainRegion> contained cells that projected to the <BrainRegion>supraoptic nucleus</BrainRegion> but these projections were not significantly activated at parturition, although non-projecting cells in these regions were. On the expected day of parturition, but before birth, projections from the <BrainRegion>organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>supraoptic nucleus</BrainRegion> became significantly activated.These findings provide evidence of direct afferent pathways to the <BrainRegion>supraoptic nucleus</BrainRegion> from the <BrainRegion>brain stem</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>olfactory bulbs</BrainRegion> that are activated at parturition.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Afferents to the <BrainRegion>central nucleus of the amygdala</BrainRegion> and functional subdivisions of the <BrainRegion>periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion>: neuroanatomical substrates for affective behavior.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Evidence suggests the <BrainRegion>periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion> (PAG) is involved in the integration of behavioral and autonomic components of affective behavior. Our laboratory has shown that electrical stimulation of the <BrainRegion>ventrolateral periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion> (vl periaqueductal gray(PAG) ) versus the <BrainRegion>dorsolateral periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion> (dl periaqueductal gray(PAG) ), in the rabbit, elicits two distinct behavioral/cardiorespiratory response patterns. Furthermore, evidence suggests that the <BrainRegion>amygdaloid central nucleus</BrainRegion> (ACe) may influence cardiovascular activity during emotional states. The purpose of this study was to delineate the topography and determine the origin of <BrainRegion>forebrain</BrainRegion> projections to the <BrainRegion>periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion>(PAG) and the <BrainRegion>amygdaloid central nucleus</BrainRegion>(ACe) , as well as commonalties and differences in the pattern of afferents. Examination of common afferents may lend insights into their function as components of a <BrainRegion>forebrain</BrainRegion> system regulating autonomic activity during emotional states. Separate retrograde tracers were injected into functional subdivisions of the <BrainRegion>periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion>(PAG) and the <BrainRegion>amygdaloid central nucleus</BrainRegion>(ACe) in rabbits. <BrainRegion>periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion>(PAG) injections led to neuronal labeling in numerous <BrainRegion>cortical regions</BrainRegion> including the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral medial prefrontal</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>insular cortices</BrainRegion>. Additionally, bilateral labeling was observed in several <BrainRegion>hypothalamic nuclei</BrainRegion> including the <BrainRegion>paraventricular nucleus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>dorsomedial nucleus</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>ventromedial nucleus</BrainRegion> as well as the <BrainRegion>region lateral to the descending column of the fornix</BrainRegion>. Sparse labeling was also seen in various <BrainRegion>basal forebrain regions</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>thalamic nuclei</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>amygdaloid nuclei</BrainRegion>. Many of these regions were also labeled following injections in the <BrainRegion>amygdaloid central nucleus</BrainRegion>(ACe) . Although double-labeled cells were never observed, afferents to the <BrainRegion>amygdaloid central nucleus</BrainRegion>(ACe) were often proximal to <BrainRegion>periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion>(PAG) afferents. Implications of these findings are discussed in terms of two functionally distinct behavioral/cardiovascular response patterns.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Overlapping corticostriatal projections from the rodent vibrissal representations in <BrainRegion>primary and secondary somatosensory cortex</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>To determine whether the <BrainRegion>neostriatum</BrainRegion> receives overlapping projections from two <BrainRegion>somatosensory cortical areas</BrainRegion>, the anterograde tracers biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) and fluoro-ruby (FR) were injected into the whisker representations of primary (<BrainRegion>SI</BrainRegion>) and secondary (<BrainRegion>SII</BrainRegion>) <BrainRegion>somatosensory cortex</BrainRegion>. Reconstructions of labeled terminals and their beaded varicosities in the <BrainRegion>neostriatum</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion> were analyzed quantitatively to compare the extent of overlapping projections to both <BrainRegion>subcortical structures</BrainRegion>. Corticostriatal projections from focal sites in both <BrainRegion>somatosensory areas</BrainRegion> exhibited substantial amounts of divergence within the <BrainRegion>dorsolateral neostriatum</BrainRegion>. Most of the labeled terminals were concentrated in densely packed arborizations that occupied lamellar-shaped regions along the dorsolateral edge of the <BrainRegion>neostriatum</BrainRegion>. Tracer injections in both <BrainRegion>cortical areas</BrainRegion> also produced dense anterograde and retrograde labeling in the <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion>, especially in the <BrainRegion>ventrobasal complex</BrainRegion> (VB) and in the <BrainRegion>medial part of the posterior (POm) nucleus</BrainRegion>. Because these <BrainRegion>thalamic regions</BrainRegion> are topographically organized and have reciprocal connections with corresponding representations in both <BrainRegion>SI</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>SII</BrainRegion>, the amount of labeled overlap in the <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion> was used to indicate the degree of somatotopic correspondence at the <BrainRegion>SI</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>SII</BrainRegion> injection sites. We found that the proportion of overlapping projections to the <BrainRegion>neostriatum</BrainRegion> was moderately correlated with the amount of overlap observed in the <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion>. This result strongly indicates that specific sites in the <BrainRegion>dorsolateral neostriatum</BrainRegion> receive convergent projections from corresponding somatotopic representations in <BrainRegion>SI and SII</BrainRegion>, but also suggests that some of the corticostriatal divergence may reflect <BrainRegion>neostriatal</BrainRegion> integration of somatosensory information from noncorresponding representations in <BrainRegion>SI</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>SII</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Relative distribution of synapses in the <BrainRegion>pulvinar nucleus</BrainRegion> of the cat: implications regarding the &quot;driver/modulator" theory of <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> function.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>To provide a quantitative comparison of the synaptic organization of &quot;first-order" and "higher-order" <BrainRegion>thalamic nuclei</BrainRegion>, we followed bias-corrected sampling methods identical to a previous study of the cat <BrainRegion>dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion> (dLGN; Van Horn et al. [2000] J. Comp. Neurol. 416:509-520) to examine the distribution of terminal types within the cat <BrainRegion>pulvinar nucleus</BrainRegion>. We observed the following distribution of synaptic contacts: large terminals that contain loosely packed round vesicles (RL profiles), 3.5%; presynaptic profiles that contain densely packed pleomorphic vesicles (F1 profiles), 7.3%; profiles that could be both presynaptic and postsynaptic that contain loosely packed pleomorphic vesicles (F2 profiles), 5.0%; and small terminals that contain densely packed round vesicles (RS profiles), 84.2%. Postembedding immunocytochemistry for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) was used to distinguish the postsynaptic targets as thalamocortical cells or interneurons. The distribution of synaptic contacts on thalamocortical cells was as follows: RL profiles, 2.1%; F1 profiles, 6.9%; F2 profiles, 5.4%; and RS profiles, 85.6%. The distribution of synaptic contacts on interneurons was as follows: RL profiles, 11.8%; F1 profiles, 9.7%; F2 profiles, 2.8%; and RS profiles, 75.6%. These distributions are similar to that found within the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus(dLGN) in that the RS inputs (the presumed &quot;modulators") far outnumber the RL inputs (the presumed "drivers"). However, in comparison to the <BrainRegion>dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(dLGN) , the <BrainRegion>pulvinar nucleus</BrainRegion> receives significantly fewer numbers of RL, F1, and F2 contacts and significantly higher numbers of RS contacts. Thus, the RS/RL synapse ratio in the <BrainRegion>pulvinar nucleus</BrainRegion> is 24:1, in contrast to the 5:1 RS/RL synapse ratio in the <BrainRegion>dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(dLGN) (Van Horn et al., 2000). In first-order nuclei, the lower RS/RL synapse ratio may result in the transfer of visual information that is largely unmodified. In contrast, in higher-order nuclei, the higher RS/RL synapse ratio may allow for a finer modulation of driving inputs.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Neuroanatomy of the mormyrid electromotor control system.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Mormyrid fish produce a diverse range of electric signals that are under the control of a central electromotor network. The anatomical organization of this network was delineated by injecting biotinylated compounds into neurophysiologically identified nuclei. Previous work using retrograde labeling with horseradish peroxidase indicated that the <BrainRegion>medullary command nucleus</BrainRegion> (CN) receives inputs from the <BrainRegion>precommand nucleus</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>P command nucleus</BrainRegion>(CN) ) at the <BrainRegion>mesencephalic-diencephalic border</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>ventroposterior nucleus</BrainRegion> (VP) in the <BrainRegion>torus semicircularis</BrainRegion>. This study confirms these projections and identifies the <BrainRegion>dorsal posterior nucleus</BrainRegion> (DP) in the <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion> as an additional input to <BrainRegion>command nucleus</BrainRegion>(CN) . <BrainRegion>dorsal posterior nucleus</BrainRegion>(DP) and <BrainRegion>P command nucleus</BrainRegion>(CN) form a bilateral column of cells extending ventrolaterally and caudally from the <BrainRegion>dorsal thalamus</BrainRegion>. The primary input to <BrainRegion>dorsal posterior nucleus</BrainRegion>(DP) /<BrainRegion>P command nucleus</BrainRegion>(CN) is from <BrainRegion>ventroposterior nucleus</BrainRegion>(VP) , which is identified as having two distinct subdivisions. A small group of large, multipolar cells along the ventral edge projects to <BrainRegion>dorsal posterior nucleus</BrainRegion>(DP) <BrainRegion>/P command nucleus</BrainRegion>(CN) and to <BrainRegion>command nucleus</BrainRegion>(CN) , whereas a dorsal group of small, ovoid cells projects to <BrainRegion>dorsal posterior nucleus</BrainRegion>(DP) /<BrainRegion>P command nucleus</BrainRegion>(CN) but not to <BrainRegion>command nucleus</BrainRegion>(CN) . <BrainRegion>ventroposterior nucleus</BrainRegion>(VP) receives input from the <BrainRegion>tectum mesencephali</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>mesencephalic command-associated nucleus</BrainRegion> (MCA). As in all vertebrates, the <BrainRegion>tectum mesencephali</BrainRegion> receives input from several sources and likely provides multimodal sensory input to the electromotor system. <BrainRegion>mesencephalic command-associated nucleus</BrainRegion>(MCA) is part of the electromotor corollary discharge pathway, and its projection to <BrainRegion>ventroposterior nucleus</BrainRegion>(VP) suggests a feedback loop. These results, combined with recent physiological studies and comparisons with other taxa, suggest that modifiable feedback to <BrainRegion>dorsal posterior nucleus</BrainRegion>(DP) /<BrainRegion>P command nucleus</BrainRegion>(CN) plays a critical role in electromotor control and that the different inputs to <BrainRegion>command nucleus</BrainRegion>(CN) may each be responsible for generating distinct electric signals.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Organization of the avian <BrainRegion>basal forebrain</BrainRegion>: chemical anatomy in the parrot (Melopsittacus undulatus).</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Hodological, electrophysiological, and ablation studies indicate a role for the <BrainRegion>basal forebrain</BrainRegion> in <BrainRegion>telencephalic</BrainRegion> vocal control; however, to date the organization of the <BrainRegion>basal forebrain</BrainRegion> has not been extensively studied in any nonmammal or nonhuman vocal learning species. To this end the chemical anatomy of the avian <BrainRegion>basal forebrain</BrainRegion> was investigated in a vocal learning parrot, the budgerigar (Melopsittacus undulatus). Immunological and histological stains, including choline acetyltransferase, acetylcholinesterase, tyrosine hydroxylase, dopamine and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein (DARPP)-32, the calcium binding proteins calbindin D-28k and parvalbumin, calcitonin gene-related peptide, iron, substance P, methionine enkephalin, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphotase diaphorase, and arginine vasotocin were used in the present study. We conclude that the <BrainRegion>ventral paleostriatum</BrainRegion> (cf. Kitt and Brauth [1981] Neuroscience 6:1551-1566) and adjacent <BrainRegion>archistriatal regions</BrainRegion> can be subdivided into several distinct subareas that are chemically comparable to mammalian <BrainRegion>basal forebrain</BrainRegion> structures. The <BrainRegion>nucleus accumbens</BrainRegion> is histochemically separable into core and shell regions. The <BrainRegion>nucleus taeniae</BrainRegion> (TN) is theorized to be homologous to the <BrainRegion>medial amygdaloid nucleus</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>archistriatum pars ventrolateralis</BrainRegion> (Avl; comparable to the pigeon <BrainRegion>archistriatum pars dorsalis</BrainRegion>) is theorized to be a possible homologue of the <BrainRegion>central amygdaloid nucleus</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>taeniae</BrainRegion>(TN) and <BrainRegion>archistriatum pars ventrolateralis</BrainRegion>(Avl) are histochemically continuous with the medial aspects of the <BrainRegion>bed nucleus of the stria terminalis</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>ventromedial striatum</BrainRegion>, forming an avian analogue of the <BrainRegion>extended amygdala</BrainRegion>. The apparent counterpart in budgerigars of the mammalian <BrainRegion>nucleus basalis of Meynert</BrainRegion> consists of a field of cholinergic neurons spanning the <BrainRegion>basal forebrain</BrainRegion>. The budgerigar <BrainRegion>septal region</BrainRegion> is theorized to be homologous as a field to the mammalian <BrainRegion>septum</BrainRegion>. Our results are discussed with regard to both the evolution of the <BrainRegion>basal forebrain</BrainRegion> and its role in vocal learning processes.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Organization of the feedback pathway from <BrainRegion>striate cortex</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>V1</BrainRegion>) to the <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion> (LGN) in the owl monkey (Aotus trivirgatus).</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The function of the corticogeniculate feedback pathway from the <BrainRegion>striate cortex</BrainRegion> (V1) to the <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion> (LGN) in primates is not well understood. Insight into possible function can be gained by studying the morphology and projection patterns of corticogeniculate axons in the <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(LGN) . The goal of this research was to examine how corticogeniculate axons innervate the functionally specific (e.g., parvocellular [P], magnocellular [M], and koniocellular [K]) and eye-specific layers of the <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(LGN) . Pressure injections of biotinylated dextran were made into owl monkey <BrainRegion>V1</BrainRegion>, and the resulting labeled axons were reconstructed through serial sections of the <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(LGN) . All of the corticogeniculate axons, regardless of termination pattern, were thin with boutons en passant or at the ends of small stalks, as described in cats. Axons were found in all layers of the <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(LGN) , and two main patterns of innervation were observed. In the first pattern, axons terminated in individual M or P <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(LGN) layers. In the second pattern of innervation, axons terminated in pairs of functionally matched layers. Examples of this type were seen within pairs of M, P, or K layers. In most cases, both classes of axons contain arbors focused within the P or M layers but also had collateral side branches in neighboring K layers. Unlike corticogeniculate axons seen in the cat, corticogeniculate axons in the owl monkey maintained topographic innervation in the <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(LGN) layers that was consistent with receptive field sizes represented in <BrainRegion>V1</BrainRegion>. The patterns of layer projections along with the retinotopic match of corticogeniculate axons within the <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(LGN) suggest that in primates <BrainRegion>V1</BrainRegion> can modulate activity in the <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(LGN) through functionally specific projections in a more tightly tuned retinotopic fashion than previously believed.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Projections of the <BrainRegion>claustrum</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>primary motor</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>premotor</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>prefrontal cortices</BrainRegion> in the macaque monkey.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The <BrainRegion>claustrum</BrainRegion> is interconnected with the <BrainRegion>frontal lobe</BrainRegion>, including the <BrainRegion>motor cortex</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>cingulate cortex</BrainRegion>. The goal of the present study was to assess whether the <BrainRegion>claustral</BrainRegion> projections to distinct areas within the <BrainRegion>frontal cortex</BrainRegion> arise from separate regions within the <BrainRegion>claustrum</BrainRegion>. Multiple injections of tracers were performed in 15 macaque monkeys, aimed toward <BrainRegion>primary motor area</BrainRegion> (M1), <BrainRegion>pre-supplementary motor area</BrainRegion> (pre-SMA), <BrainRegion>SMA-proper</BrainRegion>, rostral (PMd-r) and caudal ( <BrainRegion>premotor cortex</BrainRegion>(PM) d-c) parts of the <BrainRegion>dorsal premotor cortex</BrainRegion> ( <BrainRegion>premotor cortex</BrainRegion>(PM) ), <BrainRegion>rostral ( premotor cortex</BrainRegion>(PM) v-r) and <BrainRegion>caudal ( premotor cortex</BrainRegion>(PM) v-c) parts of the <BrainRegion>ventral premotor cortex</BrainRegion>(PM) , and <BrainRegion>superior and inferior parts of area 46</BrainRegion>. The distribution of retrogradely labeled neurons showed no clear segregation along the <BrainRegion>rostrocaudal axis of the claustrum</BrainRegion>; they were usually located along the entire <BrainRegion>anteroposterior extent of the claustrum</BrainRegion>. For all <BrainRegion>motor cortical areas</BrainRegion>, there was a general trend of the labeled neurons to occupy the <BrainRegion>dorsal and intermediate parts of the claustrum</BrainRegion> along the dorsoventral axis. The same territories were labeled after injection in <BrainRegion>area 46</BrainRegion>, but in addition numerous labeled neurons were found in the most <BrainRegion>ventral part of the claustrum</BrainRegion>. At higher resolution, however, there was clear evidence that the territories projecting to <BrainRegion>pre-supplementary motor area</BrainRegion>(pre-SMA) and <BrainRegion>SMA-proper</BrainRegion> formed separate, interdigitating, clusters along the dorsoventral axis. A comparable local segregation was observed for the two subdivisions of <BrainRegion>area 46</BrainRegion>, whereas there was more local overlap among the <BrainRegion>subareas of premotor cortex</BrainRegion>(PM) . The projections from the <BrainRegion>claustrum</BrainRegion> to the multiple <BrainRegion>subareas of the motor cortex</BrainRegion> and to <BrainRegion>area 46</BrainRegion> arise from largely overlapping territories, with, however, some degree of local segregation.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Axonal sprouting of a <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion>-<BrainRegion>spinal</BrainRegion> pathway after estrogen administration in the adult female rhesus monkey.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The <BrainRegion>nucleus retroambiguus</BrainRegion> (NRA) is located in the <BrainRegion>caudal medulla oblongata</BrainRegion> and contains <BrainRegion>premotor</BrainRegion> neurons that project to motoneuronal cell groups in the <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>. <BrainRegion>nucleus retroambiguus</BrainRegion>(NRA) projections to the <BrainRegion>lumbosacral cord</BrainRegion> are species specific and might be involved in mating behavior. In the female cat, this behavior is estrogen dependent, and estrogen induces axonal sprouting in the <BrainRegion>nucleus retroambiguus</BrainRegion>(NRA) -<BrainRegion>lumbosacral</BrainRegion> pathway. Because female receptive behavior in primates is not fully dependent on estrogen, the question arises as to whether the capacity of estrogen-induced sprouting is preserved in primates. The effect of estrogen was studied on the <BrainRegion>nucleus retroambiguus</BrainRegion>(NRA) -l<BrainRegion>umbosacral</BrainRegion> projection with the use of wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase as a tracer in six adult ovariectomized rhesus monkeys with or without estrogen priming (three controls and three treated with 20 microg/day of estradiol benzoate subcutaneously for 14 days). Light microscopy showed that the density of arborizing labeled <BrainRegion>nucleus retroambiguus</BrainRegion>(NRA) axons in the <BrainRegion>lumbosacral cord</BrainRegion> was greater in estrogen-treated than in control animals. Ultrastructurally, labeled <BrainRegion>nucleus retroambiguus</BrainRegion>(NRA) terminal profiles were quantified in motoneuron pools that supply muscles of the abdominal wall, axial, and pelvic floor. After estrogen treatment, the average number of labeled terminal profiles per area of the abdominal wall, axial, and pelvic floor motoneuron pool increased 1.5-, 3.3-, and 2.8-fold, respectively. In the estrogen-treated cases, 8.9% of labeled terminal profiles showed characteristics of growth cones. In controls, such profiles were rarely observed. The results showed that estrogen induces axonal sprouting in a <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion>-<BrainRegion>spinal</BrainRegion> pathway in the adult female rhesus monkey. These findings supported the concept that the <BrainRegion>nucleus retroambiguus</BrainRegion>(NRA) -<BrainRegion>lumbosacral</BrainRegion> pathway may be involved in sexual behavior. Moreover, they demonstrated that a long descending <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion>-<BrainRegion>spinal</BrainRegion> tract in adult nonhuman primates retains the capacity for axonal sprouting.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Origin of the dopaminergic innervation of the <BrainRegion>central extended amygdala</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>accumbens</BrainRegion> shell: a combined retrograde tracing and immunohistochemical study in the rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The origin of the dopaminergic innervation of the <BrainRegion>central extended amygdala</BrainRegion> (EAc; i.e., the <BrainRegion>lateral bed nucleus of the stria terminalis</BrainRegion> [BSTl]-<BrainRegion>central amygdaloid nucleus</BrainRegion> [Ce] continuum) and <BrainRegion>accumbens shell</BrainRegion> (AcSh) was studied in the rat by combining retrograde transport of Fluoro-Gold (FG) with tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunofluorescence. Perikaryal profiles (PP) immunoreactive to Fluoro-Gold(FG) and to both Fluoro-Gold(FG) and tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) were counted in <BrainRegion>A8-A14 dopaminergic districts</BrainRegion>. Our results suggest that dopaminergic inputs to the <BrainRegion>EAc</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>accumbens shell</BrainRegion>(AcSh) arise from the <BrainRegion>ventral tegmental area-A10</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>substantia nigra</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>pars compacta-A9</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>retrorubral nucleus-A8</BrainRegion> groups as well as from the <BrainRegion>dorsal raphe nucleus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion> substance, housing the <BrainRegion>dorsocaudal part of A10 group</BrainRegion> (A10dc). Quantitative estimates reveal that the <BrainRegion>A10dc group</BrainRegion> contains approximately half of the total number of Fluoro-Gold(FG) / tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) double-labeled Perikaryal profiles(PP) projecting to <BrainRegion>Ce</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>BSTl</BrainRegion>. By using an anti-dopamine serum, <BrainRegion>DR/PAG</BrainRegion> projections to <BrainRegion>Ce</BrainRegion> were confirmed to be in part dopaminergic. In contrast, modest numbers of Fluoro-Gold(FG) / tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) double-labeled Perikaryal profiles(PP) were seen in the <BrainRegion>A10dc</BrainRegion> group after injections in the <BrainRegion>sublenticular extended amygdala</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>interstitial nucleus of the posterior limb of the anterior commissure</BrainRegion> or <BrainRegion>accumbens shell</BrainRegion>(AcSh) . <BrainRegion>Ventral mesencephalic</BrainRegion> projections to the <BrainRegion>EAc</BrainRegion> display a crude mediolateral topographic organization, whereas those to the <BrainRegion>accumbens shell</BrainRegion>(AcSh) are topographically organized along a mediolateral and an inverted dorsoventral dimension. The <BrainRegion>diencephalic dopaminergic groups</BrainRegion> do not innervate the <BrainRegion>EAc</BrainRegion> or <BrainRegion>accumbens shell</BrainRegion>(AcSh) , except for the <BrainRegion>periventricular gray-A11</BrainRegion> which sends light dopaminergic projections to <BrainRegion>Ce</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>BSTl</BrainRegion>. Overall, the present results provide additional details on the organization of the <BrainRegion>mesolimbic</BrainRegion> dopaminergic system that critically controls behavioral responsiveness to salient environmental stimuli.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Ascending and descending projections from the <BrainRegion>superior olivary complex</BrainRegion> in guinea pigs: different cells project to the <BrainRegion>cochlear nucleus</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>inferior colliculus</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The <BrainRegion>superior olivary complex</BrainRegion> is a source of ascending projections to the <BrainRegion>inferior colliculus</BrainRegion> and descending projections to the <BrainRegion>cochlear nucleus</BrainRegion>. We used multiple-labeling techniques with fluorescent retrograde tracers to determine whether individual <BrainRegion>superior olivary</BrainRegion> cells project to the <BrainRegion>inferior colliculus</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>cochlear nucleus</BrainRegion>. Almost all labeled cells contained one tracer, suggesting that they projected to only one of the injected targets. A small number of cells sent collateral projections to the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral cochlear nucleus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>ipsilateral inferior colliculus</BrainRegion>. The double-labeled cells constituted fewer than 2% of the cells that projected to the <BrainRegion>cochlear nucleus</BrainRegion> or to the <BrainRegion>inferior colliculus</BrainRegion>. There was no evidence for cells projecting to both contralateral targets or to one ipsilateral target and one contralateral target. We conclude that the ascending projections to the <BrainRegion>inferior colliculus</BrainRegion> and the descending projections to the <BrainRegion>cochlear nucleus</BrainRegion> arise almost exclusively from separate populations of cells in the <BrainRegion>superior olivary complex</BrainRegion>. Their separate origins suggest that these projections are sending different information to higher and lower centers of the auditory pathways.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Development of visual projections follows an avian/mammalian-like sequence in the lizard Ctenophorus ornatus.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Development of <BrainRegion>primary visual</BrainRegion> projections was examined in a lizard Ctenophorus ornatus by anterograde and retrograde tracing with DiI and by GAP-43 immunohistochemistry. Visual pathway development was essentially similar to that in birds and mammals and thus differed from patterns in fish or amphibians. A number of features characterised the development as mammalian-like. Three phases occurred in rapid succession after laying: outgrowth (2-3 weeks, early), exuberance (4-5 weeks, intermediate), and retraction to the adult pattern (6-8 weeks, late) at about the time of hatching and eye opening. Furthermore, ipsilateral projections developed with only a slight lag relative to the contralateral ones. The dorsally located <BrainRegion>fovea</BrainRegion> could be identified from early stages. <BrainRegion>Optic</BrainRegion> axons formed transient exuberant projections to the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral optic tectum</BrainRegion>, to the <BrainRegion>opposite optic nerve</BrainRegion>, and to nonvisual regions. The pattern resembled that formed in the long term by regenerating <BrainRegion>optic</BrainRegion> axons in C. ornatus (Dunlop et al. [2000b] J. Comp. Neurol. 416:188-200), suggesting that axons recognise molecular signals associated with the initial exuberant innervation but not those associated with subsequent refinement.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>GABAergic circuitry in the dorsal division of the cat <BrainRegion>medial geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter of the <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion>. We used postembedding immunocytochemistry to examine the synaptic organization of Gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) -positive profiles in the dorsal superficial subdivision of the cat <BrainRegion>medial geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion> (MGN). Three groups of Gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) -positive profiles participate in synapses: axon terminals, dendrites, and presynaptic dendrites. The presynaptic Gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) -positive terminals target mainly Gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) -negative dendrites. The Gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) -positive postsynaptic profiles receive input primarily from Gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) -negative axons. The results indicate that the synaptic organization of Gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) -positive profiles in the <BrainRegion>dorsal superficial subdivision of the medial geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(MGN) nucleus is very similar to that in other <BrainRegion>thalamic nuclei</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Human GABA A receptors on dopaminergic neurons in the <BrainRegion>pars compacta of the substantia nigra</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABA(A)) receptor subunit expression of the dopaminergic cells of the <BrainRegion>substantia nigra</BrainRegion> (SN) was investigated in the present study. Especially the dopaminergic cells, located in the <BrainRegion>pars compacta of substantia nigra</BrainRegion>(SN) ( <BrainRegion>substantia nigra</BrainRegion>(SN) c), are of great neurologic interest, because the functional deficit and depletion of these cells are the correlate of Parkinson&apos;s disease. We used a combination of in situ hybridization histochemistry (ISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) on sections of human postmortem <BrainRegion>mesencephalon</BrainRegion> to investigate the expression of GABA(A) receptor subunit messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and of the receptor protein in dopaminergic <BrainRegion>substantia nigra</BrainRegion>(SN) cells. Immunohistochemical detection of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the pivotal enzyme of dopamine synthesis, was used to define the boundaries of <BrainRegion>substantia nigra(SN) pars reticulata</BrainRegion> ( <BrainRegion>substantia nigra</BrainRegion>(SN) r) and <BrainRegion>pars compacta subregions</BrainRegion>. In <BrainRegion>substantia nigra</BrainRegion>(SN) r, all neurons were labeled by subunit-specific oligonucleotide probes and the amount of GABA(A) receptor mRNA expression was quantified as alpha(1) = beta(2) &amp;gt; gamma(2) &gt; alpha(3). In contrast, in substantia nigra(SN) c, only around 25% of neurons expressed mRNA transcripts of GABA(A) receptor subunits, quantified as alpha(1) = beta(2) &gt; gamma(2) &gt; alpha(3) &gt; alpha(4) = beta(3). In approximately the same percentage of neurons, which were labeled by alpha(1)-subunit-specific probe, the alpha(1)-subunit also was detected at the protein level by a specific monoclonal antibody. We, therefore, could demonstrate that a subset of dopaminergic neurons in human <BrainRegion>substantia nigra</BrainRegion>(SN) c receive inhibitory synaptic input by means of GABA(A) receptors mainly of the alpha(1)beta(2)gamma(2) subtype. This might represent a negative feedback loop between the <BrainRegion>striatum</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>substantia nigra</BrainRegion>(SN) c and be a target of pharmacologic interventions in neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson&apos;s disease.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Organization of trigeminocollicular connections and their relations to the sensory innervation of the eyelids in the rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Relationships between the <BrainRegion>trigeminal</BrainRegion> component of blinking and the <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion> (SC) were studied in rats. To localize primary afferent eyelid projections in the <BrainRegion>sensory trigeminal complex</BrainRegion>, neuronal tracing experiments were performed as well as analysis of c-Fos protein expression after <BrainRegion>supraorbital (SO) nerve</BrainRegion> stimulation. Labelled nerve fibers were found to enter ventrally within the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral sensory trigeminal complex</BrainRegion>. Labelled boutons were observed at the junction of the <BrainRegion>principal nucleus</BrainRegion> (5P) and the <BrainRegion>pars oralis</BrainRegion> (5o) and in the <BrainRegion>pars caudalis</BrainRegion> (5c). The c-Fos immunoreactivity was observed in neurons located in the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral ventral parts of 5P, 5o, and the pars interpolaris</BrainRegion> (5i) and <BrainRegion>bilaterally in 5c</BrainRegion>. Injections in <BrainRegion>5P</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>5o</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>5i</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>5c</BrainRegion> resulted in anterogradely labelled fibers, with a contralateral preponderance, within the intermediate and deeper <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion>(SC) layers. Injections in <BrainRegion>5P</BrainRegion> or <BrainRegion>5o</BrainRegion> showed anterogradely labelled nerve fibers, profusely terminating in small patches in the medial and central portions of <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion>(SC) layer 4. Subsequently, dense labelling was found in the lateral portion of <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion>(SC) layers 4-7, without patch-like organization. Injections in <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion>(SC) showed retrogradely labelled neurons predominantly within the <BrainRegion>contralateral part of the sensory trigeminal complex</BrainRegion> (28% in 5P, 20% in 5o, 50% in 5i, and 2% in 5c). Colocalization of the retrograde tracer after <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion>(SC) injections and c-Fos immunoreactivity in neurons demonstrated that some <BrainRegion>5P</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>5o</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>5i</BrainRegion> neurons receive <BrainRegion>supraorbital(SO) nerve</BrainRegion> inputs and project to <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion>(SC) . This implies that intermediate and deeper <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion>(SC) layers receive sensory information from the eyelids and may be directly involved in the regulation of eye-eyelid coordination.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Similarities and differences in the innervation of <BrainRegion>mystacial vibrissal follicle-sinus complexes</BrainRegion> in the rat and cat: a confocal microscopic study.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Our confocal three-dimensional analyses revealed substantial differences in the innervation to <BrainRegion>vibrissal follicle-sinus complexes</BrainRegion> (FSCs) in the rat and cat. This is the first study using anti-protein gene product 9.5 (PGP9.5) immunolabeling and confocal microscopy on thick sections to examine systematically the terminal arborizations of the various <BrainRegion>FSC</BrainRegion> endings and to compare them between two species, the rat and the cat, that have similar-appearing <BrainRegion>follicle-sinus complexes</BrainRegion>(FSCs) but different exploratory behaviors, such as existence or absence of whisking. At least eight distinct endings were clearly discriminated three dimensionally in this study: 1) Merkel endings at the <BrainRegion>rete ridge collar</BrainRegion>, 2) circumferentially oriented lanceolate endings, 3) Merkel endings at the level of the ring sinus, 4) longitudinally oriented lanceolate endings, 5) club-like ringwulst endings, 6) reticular endings, 7) spiny endings, and 8) encapsulated endings. Of particular contrast, each nerve fiber that innervates Merkel cells at the level of the ring sinus in the rat usually terminates as a single, relatively small cluster of endings, whereas in the cat they terminate en passant as several large clusters of endings. Also, individual arbors of reticular endings in the rat ramify parallel to the vibrissae and distribute over wide, overlapping territories, whereas those in the cat ramify perpendicular and terminate in tightly circumscribed territories. Otherwise, the inner conical body of rat <BrainRegion>follicle-sinus complexes</BrainRegion>(FSCs) contains en passant, circumferentially oriented lanceolate endings that are lacking in the cat, whereas the <BrainRegion>cavernous sinus</BrainRegion> of the cat has en passant corpuscular endings that are lacking in the rat. Surprisingly, the one type of innervation that is the most similar in both species is a major set of simple, club-like endings, located at the attachment of the ringwulst, that had not previously been recognized as a morphologically unique type of innervation. Although the basic structure of the <BrainRegion>follicle-sinus complexes</BrainRegion>(FSCs) is similar in the rat and cat, the numerous differences in innervation suggest that these species would have different tactile capabilities and perceptions possibly related to their different vibrissa-related exploratory behaviors.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Primary afferent input to and receptive field properties of cells in rat <BrainRegion>lumbar area X</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>In this study we examined the primary afferent input to rat <BrainRegion>area X of Rexed</BrainRegion>, and characterized sensory receptive fields (RFs) of the cells therein. This poorly understood area contains primary afferent fibres, some of which are arranged into a compact bundle beneath the <BrainRegion>central canal</BrainRegion>. Anterograde transport of the B fragment of cholera toxin (CTB) from the <BrainRegion>sciatic nerve</BrainRegion> showed a strictly ipsilateral projection to segments in <BrainRegion>L4</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>L5</BrainRegion> but both ipsi- and contralateral projections in <BrainRegion>L6</BrainRegion> and more caudal segments. The response of cells in <BrainRegion>area X</BrainRegion> to mechanical cutaneous stimuli was recorded through extracellular microelectrodes in decerebrate, decerebrate-spinal, and urethane-anaesthetised preparations. The lateral edge of <BrainRegion>area X</BrainRegion> was marked by an abrupt change in the receptive fields(RFs) : <BrainRegion>Lateral to area X in the dorsal horn</BrainRegion>, they were strictly unilateral and relatively small. At a mean of 90 microm from the midline, there was an abrupt expansion of the receptive fields(RFs) to cover at least the entire ipsilateral dermatome. Within <BrainRegion>area X</BrainRegion>, 70% of the cells&apos; receptive fields(RFs) extended across the midline to include contralateral skin. In 35% of cells recorded in rats with intact <BrainRegion>spinal cords</BrainRegion>, the RF extended rostrally onto the forelimb. In a small number of cells, the RF included ear pinnae and nose. The precise function of <BrainRegion>area X</BrainRegion> cells remains unknown; although they have been shown to be involved in visceral reflexes, the fact that they receive convergent input from a wide variety of tissues and from local and remote body parts implies a more generalized, integrative function.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Brainstem</BrainRegion> projections to <BrainRegion>midline and intralaminar thalamic nuclei</BrainRegion> of the rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The projections from the <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>midline and intralaminar thalamic nuclei</BrainRegion> were examined in the rat. Stereotaxic injections of the retrograde tracer cholera toxin beta -subunit (CTb) were made in each of the <BrainRegion>intralaminar nuclei of the dorsal thalamus</BrainRegion>: the <BrainRegion>lateral parafascicular</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>medial parafascicular</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>central lateral</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>paracentral</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>oval paracentral</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>central medial nuclei</BrainRegion>; in the <BrainRegion>midline thalamic nuclei</BrainRegion>-the <BrainRegion>paraventricular</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>intermediodorsal</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>mediodorsal</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>paratenial</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>rhomboid</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>reuniens</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>submedius nuclei</BrainRegion>; and, in the <BrainRegion>anteroventral, parvicellular part of the ventral posterior</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>caudal ventral medial nuclei</BrainRegion>. The retrograde cell body labeling pattern within the <BrainRegion>brainstem nuclei</BrainRegion> was then analyzed. Nearly every <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> site received a projection from the <BrainRegion>deep mesencephalic reticular</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>pedunculopontine tegmental</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>dorsal raphe</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>median raphe</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>laterodorsal tegmental</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>locus coeruleus nuclei</BrainRegion>. Most <BrainRegion>intralaminar thalamic sites</BrainRegion> were also innervated by unique combinations of <BrainRegion>medullary and pontine reticular formation nuclei</BrainRegion> such as the <BrainRegion>subnucleus reticularis dorsalis</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>gigantocellular</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>dorsal paragigantocellular</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>lateral</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>parvicellular</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>caudal pontine</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>ventral pontine</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>oral pontine reticular nuclei</BrainRegion>; the <BrainRegion>dorsomedial tegmental</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>subpeduncular tegmental</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>ventral tegmental areas</BrainRegion>; and, the <BrainRegion>central tegmental field</BrainRegion>. In addition, most <BrainRegion>intralaminar</BrainRegion> injections resulted in retrograde cell body labeling in the <BrainRegion>substantia nigra</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>nucleus Darkschewitsch</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>interstitial nucleus of Cajal</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>cuneiform nucleus</BrainRegion>. Details concerning the pathways from the <BrainRegion>spinal trigeminal</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>nucleus tractus solitarius</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>raphe magnus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>raphe pallidus</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>rostral and caudal linear raphe nuclei</BrainRegion> to subsets of <BrainRegion>midline and intralaminar thalamic sites</BrainRegion> are discussed in the text. The discussion focuses on <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion>-<BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> pathways that are likely involved in arousal, somatosensory, and visceral functions.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Postnatal refinement of <BrainRegion>auditory nerve</BrainRegion> projections to the <BrainRegion>cochlear nucleus</BrainRegion> in cats.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Studies of visual system development have suggested that competition driven by activity is essential for refinement of initial topographically diffuse neuronal projections into their precise adult patterns. This has led to the assertion that this process may shape development of topographic connections throughout the nervous system. Because the cat auditory system is very immature at birth, with <BrainRegion>auditory nerve</BrainRegion> neurons initially exhibiting very low or no spontaneous activity, we hypothesized that the <BrainRegion>auditory nerve</BrainRegion> fibers might initially form topographically broad projections within the <BrainRegion>cochlear nuclei</BrainRegion> (CN), which later would become topographically precise at the time when adult-like frequency selectivity develops. In this study, we made restricted injections of Neurobiotin, which labeled small sectors (300-500 microm) of the <BrainRegion>cochlear spiral ganglion</BrainRegion>, to study the projections of <BrainRegion>auditory nerve</BrainRegion> fibers representing a narrow band of frequencies. Results showed that projections from the <BrainRegion>basal cochlea</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>cochlear nuclei</BrainRegion>(CN) are tonotopically organized in neonates, many days before the onset of functional hearing and even prior to the development of spontaneous activity in the <BrainRegion>auditory nerve</BrainRegion>. However, results also demonstrated that significant refinement of the topographic specificity of the primary afferent axons of the <BrainRegion>auditory nerve</BrainRegion> occurs in late gestation or early postnatal development. Projections to all <BrainRegion>three subdivisions of the cochlear nuclei</BrainRegion>(CN) exhibit clear tonotopic organization at or before birth, but the topographic restriction of fibers into frequency band laminae is significantly less precise in perinatal kittens than in adult cats. Two injections spaced &amp;gt; or = 2 mm apart in the <BrainRegion>cochlea</BrainRegion> resulted in labeled bands of projecting axons in the <BrainRegion>anteroventral cochlear nuclei</BrainRegion>(CN) that were 53% broader than would be expected if they were proportional to those in adults, and the two projections were incompletely segregated in the youngest animals studied. <BrainRegion>Posteroventral cochlear nuclei</BrainRegion>(CN) (<BrainRegion>PV cochlear nuclei</BrainRegion>(CN) ) projections (normalized for <BrainRegion>cochlear nuclei</BrainRegion>(CN) size) were 36% broader in neonates than in adults, and projections from double injections in the youngest subjects were nearly fused in the <BrainRegion>PV cochlear nuclei</BrainRegion>(CN) . Projections to the <BrainRegion>dorsal division of the cochlear nuclei</BrainRegion>(CN) were 32% broader in neonates than in adults when normalized, but the <BrainRegion>dorsal cochlear nuclei</BrainRegion>(CN) projections were always discrete, even at the earliest ages studied.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Perirhinal and parahippocampal cortices</BrainRegion> of the macaque monkey: projections to the <BrainRegion>neocortex</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>We investigated the topographic and laminar organization of the efferent <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> projections of the <BrainRegion>perirhinal and parahippocampal cortices</BrainRegion>. <BrainRegion>Area 36 of the perirhinal cortex</BrainRegion> projects preferentially to <BrainRegion>areas TE</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>TEO</BrainRegion>, whereas <BrainRegion>area TF of the parahippocampal cortex</BrainRegion> projects preferentially to the <BrainRegion>posterior parietal cortex</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>area V4</BrainRegion>. <BrainRegion>Area TF</BrainRegion> projects to many regions of the <BrainRegion>frontal lobe</BrainRegion>, whereas <BrainRegion>area 36</BrainRegion> projects mainly to the <BrainRegion>orbital surface</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>insular and cingulate cortices</BrainRegion> receive projections from <BrainRegion>areas 36</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>TF</BrainRegion>, whereas only <BrainRegion>area TF</BrainRegion> projects to the <BrainRegion>retrosplenial cortex</BrainRegion>. Projections to the <BrainRegion>superior temporal gyrus</BrainRegion>, including the <BrainRegion>dorsal bank of the superior temporal sulcus</BrainRegion>, arise predominantly from <BrainRegion>area TF</BrainRegion>. <BrainRegion>Area 36</BrainRegion> projects only to <BrainRegion>rostral levels of the superior temporal gyrus</BrainRegion>. <BrainRegion>Area TF</BrainRegion> has, in general, reciprocal connections with the <BrainRegion>neocortex</BrainRegion>, whereas <BrainRegion>area 36</BrainRegion> has more asymmetric connections. <BrainRegion>Area 36</BrainRegion>, for example, projects to more restricted regions of the <BrainRegion>frontal cortex</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>superior temporal sulcus</BrainRegion> than it receives inputs from. In contrast, it projects to larger portions of <BrainRegion>areas TE</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>TEO</BrainRegion> than it receives inputs from. The efferent projections of <BrainRegion>areas 36</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>TF</BrainRegion> are primarily directed to the <BrainRegion>superficial layers of the neocortex</BrainRegion>, a laminar organization consistent with connections of the feedback type. Projections to <BrainRegion>unimodal visual areas</BrainRegion> terminate in <BrainRegion>large expanses of the cortex</BrainRegion>, but predominantly in layer I. Projections to other <BrainRegion>sensory and polymodal areas</BrainRegion>, in contrast, terminate in a columnar manner predominantly in layers II and III. In all areas receiving heavy projections, the projections extend throughout most <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> layers, largely avoiding layer IV. We discuss these findings in relation to current theories of memory consolidation.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Nigral</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>pallidal</BrainRegion> inputs to functionally segregated thalamostriatal neurons in the <BrainRegion>centromedian/parafascicular intralaminar nuclear complex</BrainRegion> in monkey.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>In primates, thalamostriatal projections from the <BrainRegion>centromedian</BrainRegion> (CM) and <BrainRegion>parafascicular (Pf) nuclei</BrainRegion> are strong and organized according to a strict pattern of functional connectivity with various regions of the <BrainRegion>striatal complex</BrainRegion>. In turn, the <BrainRegion>centromedian(CM) / parafascicular(Pf) complex</BrainRegion> receives a substantial innervation from the <BrainRegion>internal globus pallidus</BrainRegion> (GPi). In this study, we demonstrate that the <BrainRegion>substantia nigra pars reticulata</BrainRegion> (SNr) also provides a massive input to <BrainRegion>parafascicular</BrainRegion>(Pf) in monkeys. These pallidothalamic and <BrainRegion>nigrothalamic</BrainRegion> projections provide routes whereby information can flow in functional loops between the <BrainRegion>basal ganglia</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>intralaminar nuclear group</BrainRegion>. To understand better the anatomical organization and the degree of functional specificity of these loops, we combined retrograde and anterograde labeling methods from functionally defined regions of the <BrainRegion>striatum</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>globus pallidus</BrainRegion>(GPi) / <BrainRegion>substantia nigra pars reticulata</BrainRegion>(SNr) to determine the relationships between thalamostriatal neurons and <BrainRegion>basal ganglia</BrainRegion> afferents. Together with previous studies, our data suggest the existence of tightly connected functional circuits between the <BrainRegion>basal ganglia</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>centromedian(CM) / parafascicular(Pf)</BrainRegion> in primates: 1) A &quot;sensorimotor" circuit links together the <BrainRegion>medial two-thirds of centromedian</BrainRegion>(CM) , the <BrainRegion>postcommissural putamen</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>ventrolateral part of the caudal globus pallidus</BrainRegion>(GPi) ; 2) a &quot;<BrainRegion>limbic</BrainRegion>&quot; circuit involves the <BrainRegion>rostral one-third of parafascicular</BrainRegion>(Pf) , the <BrainRegion>ventral striatum</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>rostromedial pole of globus pallidus</BrainRegion>(GPi) ; and 3) an &quot;associative"circuit exists between the <BrainRegion>caudal two-thirds of parafascicular</BrainRegion>(Pf) , the <BrainRegion>caudate nucleus</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>substantia nigra pars reticulata</BrainRegion>(SNr) . An additional &quot;associative" circuit that involves the <BrainRegion>caudate-receiving territory of globus pallidus</BrainRegion>(GPi) (dorsal one-third), the <BrainRegion>dorsolateral parafascicular</BrainRegion>(Pf) ( parafascicular(Pf) dl), and the <BrainRegion>precommissural putamen</BrainRegion> was also disclosed. In conclusion, findings of this study provide additional evidence for the high degree of functional specificity of the thalamostriatal system through which <BrainRegion>centromedian</BrainRegion>(CM) / <BrainRegion>parafascicular</BrainRegion>(Pf) may provide attention-specific sensory information important for conditional responses to the primate <BrainRegion>striatum</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Development of convergent synaptic inputs to subpopulations of autonomic neurons.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Visceromotor neurons in mammalian prevertebral sympathetic ganglia receive convergent synaptic inputs from spinal preganglionic neurons and peripheral intestinofugal neurons projecting from the enteric plexuses. Vasomotor neurons in the same ganglia receive only preganglionic inputs. How this pathway-specific pattern of connectivity is established is unknown. We have used a combination of immunohistochemical, ultrastructural, and electrophysiological techniques to investigate the development of synaptic inputs onto visceromotor and vasomotor neurons in the celiac ganglion of guinea pigs. Functional synaptogenesis occurred primarily from early fetal (F30-F35) to midfetal (F36-F45) stages, after the neurochemical differentiation of vasomotor and visceromotor neurons but before establishment of their electrophysiological phenotypes. Intestinofugal inputs were detected only on presumptive visceromotor neurons located primarily in medial regions of the ganglion. The number of ultrastructurally identified synaptic profiles increased in parallel with functional synaptogenesis, especially in medial regions, where dendritic growth rates also were higher. However, the expression of immunoreactivity to choline acetyltransferase in the terminals of inputs was very low until late fetal stages, after functional transmission already had been established. These results show that peripheral intestinofugal neurons directly establish appropriate functional connections with their target visceromotor neurons simultaneously with the development of functional preganglionic inputs to both visceromotor and vasomotor neurons. It seems likely that synaptogenesis occurs independently of the neurochemical differentiation of the target neurons but is closely related to the pathway-specific dendritic development of those neurons.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Retinofugal projections in the short-tailed opossum (Monodelphis domestica).</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>In the current investigation, retinofugal projections to <BrainRegion>midbrain</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>thalamic nuclei of Monodelphis domestica</BrainRegion> were investigated using wheat-germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP). Large intraocular injections of wheat-germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase(WGA-HRP) were placed into the <BrainRegion>eye</BrainRegion>, and patterns of labeled axon terminals were related to nuclear boundaries in tissue that was stained for Nissl or reacted for cytochrome oxidase (CO). Our results demonstrate that the major projection from the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> is to the <BrainRegion>contralateral dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion> (LGNd) and the <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion> (SC). Connections were also observed with the <BrainRegion>contralateral pretectal nucleus</BrainRegion> (PRT), the <BrainRegion>lateral posterior nucleus</BrainRegion> (LP), and the <BrainRegion>ventral division of the lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion> (LGNv). Ipsilateral connections were with the <BrainRegion>LGNv</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>LGNd</BrainRegion>. These findings are consistent with reports in other marsupials as well as with studies in a number of eutherian mammals. Thus, there appears to be a common pattern of <BrainRegion>retinofuga</BrainRegion>l projections that all mammals share, probably due to retention from a common ancestor. However, some features such as a lack of ipsilateral input to the species like Monodelphis(SC) (which are absent only in certain species like Monodelphis, platypus, and echidnas) may represent a primitive state retained from a common ancestor. When comparisons of retinofugal connections and <BrainRegion>LGNd</BrainRegion> organization are made across taxa, three types of organization are observed: a homogenous <BrainRegion>LGNd</BrainRegion> with a high degree of binocular overlap of projections; a partially differentiated <BrainRegion>LGNd</BrainRegion> with some segregation of <BrainRegion>eye</BrainRegion>-specific inputs; and a fully segregated structure with a large degree of segregation of <BrainRegion>eye</BrainRegion>-specific inputs. We discuss the factors that contribute to the organization observed in extant mammals and conclude that phylogeny and lifestyle appear to be the underlying factors contributing to the organization of the <BrainRegion>LGNd</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Hippocampal</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>prefrontal cortical</BrainRegion> inputs monosynaptically converge with individual projection neurons of the <BrainRegion>nucleus accumbens</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Afferents to the <BrainRegion>nucleus accumbens</BrainRegion> from different sources innervate specific areas of the central &quot;core" and peripheral "shell" and are related to each other, at the light microscopical level, in an intricate overlapping and nonoverlapping way. This lack of homogeneity suggests that this region consists of circuits involving emsembles of neurons modulated by specific sets of convergent afferent inputs and abnormal regulation of such ensembles has been implicated in mental disorders. Early extracellular studies suggested that individual Acb neurons might respond to activation of afferents from more than one excitatory input: More recent studies of <BrainRegion>hippocampal</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>amygdalar</BrainRegion> or <BrainRegion>prefrontal cortical</BrainRegion> afferents suggest that <BrainRegion>hippocampal</BrainRegion> afferents gate the input from the <BrainRegion>prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion> or <BrainRegion>amygdala</BrainRegion>. Electrophysiological evidence for convergence of excitatory afferents in the Acb is strong and suggests that these pathways are monosynaptic. Nevertheless, this convergence has proved difficult to demonstrate anatomically as a result of the spatial distribution of the afferent inputs on the dendritic tree of the target neurons. To establish whether individual <BrainRegion>accumbens</BrainRegion> neurons receive monosynaptic input from pairs of afferents, one projection was labelled anterogradely with Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin and the second with biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) with Vector slate grey and 3,3&apos;-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride as the chromagens. <BrainRegion>Accumbens</BrainRegion> neurons possibly postsynaptic to these afferents, labelled by an in vivo focal injection of biotinylated dextran amine(BDA) , were examined using correlated light and electron microscopy to establish the proximal-distal distribution of labelled afferent synaptic inputs on their dendritic arbours. Individual cells were shown to receive monosynaptic afferent input from both <BrainRegion>ventral subiculum</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion>, providing an anatomical framework for the <BrainRegion>hippocampal</BrainRegion> gating of other <BrainRegion>limbic</BrainRegion> inputs to the <BrainRegion>accumbens</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Interhemispheric connections of <BrainRegion>somatosensory cortex</BrainRegion> in the flying fox.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The interhemispheric connections of <BrainRegion>somatosensory cortex</BrainRegion> in the gray-headed flying fox (Pteropus poliocephalus) were examined. Injections of anatomical tracers were placed into five electrophysiologically identified <BrainRegion>somatosensory areas</BrainRegion>: the <BrainRegion>primary somatosensory area</BrainRegion> (SI or <BrainRegion>area 3b</BrainRegion>), the <BrainRegion>anterior parietal areas 3a and 1/2</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>lateral somatosensory areas</BrainRegion> SII (the <BrainRegion>secondary somatosensory area</BrainRegion>) and PV (<BrainRegion>pairetal ventral area</BrainRegion>). In two animals, the hemisphere opposite to that containing the injection sites was explored electrophysiologically to allow the details of the topography of interconnections to be assessed. Examination of the areal distribution of labeled cell bodies and/or axon terminals in <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion> sectioned tangential to the pial surface revealed several consistent findings. First, the density of connections varied as a function of the body part representation injected. For example, the <BrainRegion>area 3b</BrainRegion> representation of the trunk and structures of the face are more densely interconnected than the representation of distal body parts (e.g., digit 1, D1). Second, <BrainRegion>callosal</BrainRegion> connections appear to be both matched and mismatched to the body part representations injected in the opposite hemisphere. For example, an injection of retrograde tracer into the trunk representation of <BrainRegion>area 3b</BrainRegion> revealed connections from the trunk representation in the opposite hemisphere, as well as from shoulder and forelimb/wing representations. Third, the same body part is differentially connected in different fields via the <BrainRegion>corpus callosum</BrainRegion>. For example, the D1 representation in <BrainRegion>area 3b</BrainRegion> in one hemisphere had no connections with the <BrainRegion>area 3b</BrainRegion> D1 representation in the opposite hemisphere, whereas the D1 representation in <BrainRegion>area 1/2</BrainRegion> had relatively dense reciprocal connections with <BrainRegion>area 1/2 in the opposite hemisphere</BrainRegion>. Finally, there are <BrainRegion>callosal</BrainRegion> projections to fields other than the homotopic, contralateral field. For example, the D1 representation in <BrainRegion>area 1/2</BrainRegion> projects to <BrainRegion>contralateral area 1/2</BrainRegion>, and also to <BrainRegion>area 3b</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>SII</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Chemically defined projections linking the <BrainRegion>mediobasal hypothalamus</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>lateral hypothalamic area</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Recent studies have identified several neuropeptide systems in the <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion> that are critical in the regulation of body weight. The <BrainRegion>lateral hypothalamic area</BrainRegion> (LHA) has long been considered essential in regulating food intake and body weight. Two neuropeptides, melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) and the orexins (ORX), are localized in the <BrainRegion>lateral hypothalamic area</BrainRegion>(LHA) and provide diffuse innervation of the <BrainRegion>neuraxis</BrainRegion>, including monosynaptic projections to the <BrainRegion>cerebral cortex</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>autonomic preganglionic neurons</BrainRegion>. Therefore, melanin-concentrating hormone(MCH) and orexins(ORX) neurons may regulate both cognitive and autonomic aspects of food intake and body weight regulation. The <BrainRegion>arcuate nucleus</BrainRegion> also is critical in the regulation of body weight, because it contains neurons that express leptin receptors, neuropeptide Y (NPY), alpha-melanin-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH), and agouti-related peptide (AgRP). In this study, we examined the relationships of these peptidergic systems by using dual-label immunohistochemistry or in situ hybridization in rat, mouse, and human brains. In the normal rat, mouse, and human brain, orexins(ORX) and melanin-concentrating hormone(MCH) neurons make up segregated populations. In addition, we found that agouti-related peptide(AgRP) - and neuropeptide Y(NPY) -immunoreactive neurons are present in the <BrainRegion>medial division of the human arcuate nucleus</BrainRegion>, whereas alpha-melanin-stimulating hormone(alpha-MSH) -immunoreactive neurons are found in the <BrainRegion>lateral arcuate nucleus</BrainRegion>. In humans, agouti-related peptide(AgRP) projections were widespread in the <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion>, but they were especially dense in the <BrainRegion>paraventricular nucleus</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>perifornical area</BrainRegion>. Moreover, in both rat and human, melanin-concentrating hormone(MCH) and orexins(ORX) neurons receive innervation from neuropeptide Y(NPY) -, agouti-related peptide(AgRP) -, and alpha-melanin-stimulating hormone(alpha-MSH) -immunoreactive fibers. Projections from populations of leptin-responsive neurons in the <BrainRegion>mediobasal hypothalamus</BrainRegion> to melanin-concentrating hormone(MCH) and orexins(ORX) cells in the <BrainRegion>lateral hypothalamic area</BrainRegion>(LHA) may link peripheral metabolic cues with the cortical mantle and may play a critical role in the regulation of feeding behavior and body weight.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Superior area 6</BrainRegion> afferents from the <BrainRegion>superior parietal lobule</BrainRegion> in the macaque monkey.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText><BrainRegion>Superior area 6</BrainRegion> of the macaque monkey <BrainRegion>frontal cortex</BrainRegion> is formed by two cytoarchitectonic <BrainRegion>areas: F2</BrainRegion> and F7. In the present experiment, we studied the input from the <BrainRegion>superior parietal lobule</BrainRegion> (SPL) to these areas by injecting retrograde neural tracers into restricted parts of <BrainRegion>F2</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>F7</BrainRegion>. Additional injections of retrograde tracers were made into the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> to define the origin of corticospinal projections from the <BrainRegion>superior parietal lobule</BrainRegion>(SPL) . The results are as follows: 1) The part of <BrainRegion>F2</BrainRegion> located around the <BrainRegion>superior precentral dimple</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>F2 dimple region</BrainRegion>) receives its main input from <BrainRegion>areas PEc</BrainRegion> and PEip (<BrainRegion>PE intraparietal</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>rostral part of area PEa</BrainRegion> of Pandya and Seltzer, [1982] J. Comp. Neurol. 204:196-210). <BrainRegion>Area PEip</BrainRegion> was defined as that part of <BrainRegion>area PEa</BrainRegion> that is the source of corticospinal projections. 2) The <BrainRegion>ventrorostral part of F2</BrainRegion> is the target of strong projections from the <BrainRegion>medial intraparietal area</BrainRegion> (area MIP) and from the <BrainRegion>dorsal part of the anterior wall of the parietooccipital sulcus</BrainRegion> (area V6A). 3) The <BrainRegion>ventral and caudal parts of F7</BrainRegion> receive their main <BrainRegion>parietal</BrainRegion> input from the cytoarchitectonic <BrainRegion>area PGm of the superior parietal lobule</BrainRegion>(SPL) and from the <BrainRegion>posterior cingulate cortex</BrainRegion>. 4) The <BrainRegion>dorsorostral part of F7</BrainRegion>, which is also known as the <BrainRegion>supplementary eye field</BrainRegion>, is not a target of the <BrainRegion>superior parietal lobule</BrainRegion>(SPL) , but it receives mostly afferents from the <BrainRegion>inferior parietal lobule</BrainRegion> and from the <BrainRegion>temporal cortex</BrainRegion>. It is concluded that at least three separate <BrainRegion>parietofrontal</BrainRegion> circuits link the <BrainRegion>superior parietal lobule</BrainRegion> with the <BrainRegion>superior area 6</BrainRegion>. Considering the functional properties of the areas that form these circuits, it is proposed that the <BrainRegion>PEc/PEip-F2 dimple region</BrainRegion> circuit is involved in controlling movements on the basis of somatosensory information, which is the traditional role proposed for the whole <BrainRegion>dorsal premotor cortex</BrainRegion>. The two remaining circuits appear to be involved in different aspects of visuomotor transformations.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Thalamic</BrainRegion> territories innervated by <BrainRegion>cerebellar nuclear</BrainRegion> afferents in the hedgehog tenrec, Echinops telfairi.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>To gain more insight into the evolution and functional significance of <BrainRegion>cerebrocerebellar</BrainRegion> circuits, the cerebellothalamic projections were studied with anterograde tracer substances in the Madagascan lesser hedgehog, tenrec. This insectivore shows one of the lowest size indices among mammals for both the <BrainRegion>cerebellar nuclei</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>neocortex</BrainRegion>. Almost all cerebellodiencephalic target areas found in the tenrec have been described in other mammals. The intensity and extent of particular projections, however, vary considerably in the tenrec compared with the other mammals investigated so far. The most remarkable finding may be the tenrec&apos;s <BrainRegion>cerebellar</BrainRegion> projection to the <BrainRegion>nucleus ventralis medialis</BrainRegion>. This projection is the most prominent cerebellothalamic projection and originates in predominantly the <BrainRegion>lateral portion of the cerebellar nuclear complex</BrainRegion>. The projection to the <BrainRegion>caudolateral portion of the ventralis anterior complex</BrainRegion> (VAC) is located immediately rostral to the area receiving ascending somatosensory afferents and appears to originate, in particular, from the <BrainRegion>intermediate cerebellar nuclear complex</BrainRegion>. Another cerebellothalamic focus of terminations lies in the <BrainRegion>paralamellar region of the ventralis anterior complex</BrainRegion>(VAC) , whereas the <BrainRegion>proper intralaminar nuclei</BrainRegion>, at best, receive a sparse <BrainRegion>cerebellar</BrainRegion> input. A faint-to-moderate projection, on the other hand, has been traced consistently to the ventral portion of the <BrainRegion>lateralis posterior-pulvinar complex</BrainRegion> and the adjacent <BrainRegion>dorsal geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>. In addition, there are prominent cerebellosubthalamic projections to the <BrainRegion>zona incerta</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>ventral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>. The latter projection is confined mainly to the ventralmost subdivision, which has been shown previously to receive ascending somatosensory, but not <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion>, afferents. With the exception of the <BrainRegion>nucleus ventralis medialis</BrainRegion>, the projections were essentially confined to the contralateral side.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Brainstem</BrainRegion> efferents from the interface between the <BrainRegion>nucleus medialis</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>nucleus interpositus</BrainRegion> in the rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>In a previous report (Buisseret-Delmas et al. [1993] Neurosci. Res. 16:195-207), the authors identified the <BrainRegion>interface between the cerebellar nuclei medialis and interpositus</BrainRegion> as the origin of the nuclear output from <BrainRegion>cortical zone X</BrainRegion>. They named this nuclear interface the <BrainRegion>interstitial cell group</BrainRegion> (icg). In this study, the authors analyzed the <BrainRegion>interstitial cell group</BrainRegion>(icg) efferents to the <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion> by using the anterograde and retrograde tracer biotinylated dextran amine. The main targets of these efferents are from rostral to caudal: 1) the <BrainRegion>accessory oculomotor nuclear region</BrainRegion>, essentially, the <BrainRegion>interstitial nucleus of Cajal</BrainRegion>; 2) the <BrainRegion>caudoventral region of the red nucleus</BrainRegion>; 3) a <BrainRegion>dorsal zone of the nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis</BrainRegion>; 4) restricted regions of the four main <BrainRegion>vestibular nuclei</BrainRegion>; and 5) three restricted areas in the <BrainRegion>inferior olive</BrainRegion>, one that is caudal in the <BrainRegion>medial accessory subnucleus</BrainRegion> and two others that are rostral and caudal in the <BrainRegion>dorsal accessory subnucleus</BrainRegion>, respectively. These data support the notion that the <BrainRegion>interstitial cell group</BrainRegion>(icg) contributes to the control of gaze-orientation mechanisms, particularly those that are related to the vestibuloocular reflex.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Organization of <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> axons within the <BrainRegion>optic nerve</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>optic chiasm</BrainRegion>, and the innervation of multiple central nervous system targets Rana pipiens.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Light microscopic analysis of the <BrainRegion>optic nerve</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>chiasm</BrainRegion>, and optic tracts of Rana pipiens after the anterograde and retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase has shown that <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> ganglion-cell axons reach the <BrainRegion>optic nerve</BrainRegion> head in chronotopically organized fascicles that form bands across the <BrainRegion>intraocular optic nerve</BrainRegion>. These bands of fascicles are divided along the midline in a &quot;zone of reorganization" to create two full maps of the <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> surface; however, this map is discontinuous in that <BrainRegion>nasal and temporal quadrants</BrainRegion> are adjacent to one another. In the <BrainRegion>intracranial portion of the optic nerve</BrainRegion>, axons undergo another reorganization such that <BrainRegion>peripheral retinal</BrainRegion> axons shift position and become localized laterally and ventrally, whereas centrally placed axons become localized dorsally. Within this reorganization, the nerve is reconfigured into laminae of axons, and each lamina consists of age-related axons organized into two retinal maps. In the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral chiasm</BrainRegion>, axons diverge to form three central, optic tracts: the medial optic tract, the projection to the <BrainRegion>corpus geniculatum</BrainRegion>, and the basal optic root. Ipsilateral axons leave the <BrainRegion>chiasm</BrainRegion> at the same level of the chiasm as do their contralateral counterparts. The remaining axons converge in the <BrainRegion>lateral diencephalon</BrainRegion> to form a fourth fascicle, the marginal optic tract. Thus, within the <BrainRegion>optic chiasm</BrainRegion>, a sequence of positional transformations occur that result in the formation of multiple optic pathways. The various changes in axonal trajectory always coincide with changes in the orientation of cell groups that lie within the nerve and <BrainRegion>optic chiasm</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Efferent and collateral organization of <BrainRegion>paratrigeminal nucleus</BrainRegion> projections: an anterograde and retrograde fluorescent tracer study in the rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The <BrainRegion>paratrigeminal nucleus</BrainRegion> (PTN) receives primary visceral afferent projections through <BrainRegion>cranial nerves IX</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>X</BrainRegion> and somatic afferent projections through <BrainRegion>cranial nerve V</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>dorsal roots</BrainRegion> as far caudally as <BrainRegion>C7</BrainRegion>. Pressure injections of the anterograde tracer tetramethylrhodamine dextran into the <BrainRegion>paratrigeminal nucleus</BrainRegion>(PTN) in the rat resulted in bilateral labeling in the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the tractus solitarius</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>parabrachial nucleus</BrainRegion>. Anterograde labeling in the <BrainRegion>parabrachial nucleus</BrainRegion> was strongest in the <BrainRegion>external medial, external lateral, and ventral lateral subnuclei</BrainRegion>. Anterograde labeling was also found in the <BrainRegion>contralateral paratrigeminal nucleus</BrainRegion>, lamina I of the <BrainRegion>spinal trigeminal nucleus subnucleus caudalis</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>ventroposteromedial nucleus of the thalamus</BrainRegion>. The collateral organization of <BrainRegion>paratrigeminal nucleus</BrainRegion>(PTN) neurons was demonstrated by injecting different fluorescent retrograde tracers into the terminal fields of <BrainRegion>paratrigeminal nucleus</BrainRegion>(PTN) projections as determined by the anterograde tracing experiments. Double-labeled neurons were found in the <BrainRegion>paratrigeminal nucleus</BrainRegion> following all combinations of injection sites. The most prominent <BrainRegion>paratrigeminal nucleus</BrainRegion>(PTN) efferent projections and the most highly collateralized were to the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the tractus solitarius</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>parabrachial nucleus</BrainRegion>. The efferent and collateral connections of the <BrainRegion>paratrigeminal nucleus</BrainRegion> may provide a neuroanatomical substrate for integrating convergent visceral and somatic afferent information used to modulate autonomic function and behavior related to thermoregulation, nociception, and gustation.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<AbstractText>The <BrainRegion>nucleus of the tractus solitarius</BrainRegion> (NTS) is a primary termination zone for laryngeal, gustatory, cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, and other visceral afferents. Although considerable information is available on the neurochemical aspects of the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the tractus solitarius</BrainRegion>(NTS) in general, very little is known about glutamate receptors that may underlie many of the different functions mediated by the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the tractus solitarius</BrainRegion>(NTS) . In addition, most previous glutamate receptor distribution studies were performed in the rat, whereas the cat, the subject of many physiological experiments involving the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the tractus solitarius</BrainRegion>(NTS) , has received little attention. In the present study, the immunohistochemical distribution of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA)-selective glutamate receptor subunits (GluR1, GluR2/3, GluR4) and the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunit NR1 in the cat <BrainRegion>caudal brainstem</BrainRegion> was investigated by using subunit-specific antibodies. In the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the tractus solitarius</BrainRegion>(NTS) , statistically significant differences were seen in the distribution of each antibody. Highest labeling was seen for GluR2/3 in most subnuclei, whereas GluR1-immunoreactive neurons were found more frequently than were NR1- or GluR4-immunoreactive neurons. GluR1 immunolabeling was particularly high in the <BrainRegion>interstitial subnucleus</BrainRegion>, whereas GluR2/3 immunolabeling was particularly high in the <BrainRegion>intermediate subnucleus</BrainRegion>. Qualitatively, labeling for GluR4 was most common in glia. The present results indicate that glutamate receptors show different subunit distributions in the <BrainRegion>subnuclei of the nucleus of the tractus solitarius</BrainRegion>(NTS) and in other adjacent structures. This finding suggests that neurons in these structures are designed to respond differently to excitatory input.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Septal complex of the telencephalon</BrainRegion> of lizards: III. Efferent connections and general discussion.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The projections of the <BrainRegion>septum</BrainRegion> of the lizard Podarcis hispanica (Lacertidae) were studied by combining retrograde and anterograde neuroanatomical tracing. The results confirm the classification of <BrainRegion>septal nuclei</BrainRegion> into three main divisions. The nuclei composing the <BrainRegion>central septal division</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>anterior</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>lateral</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>medial</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>dorsolateral</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>ventrolateral nuclei</BrainRegion>) displayed differential projections to the <BrainRegion>basal telencephalon</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>preoptic</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>anterior hypothalamus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>lateral hypothalamic area</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>dorsal hypothalamus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>mammillary complex</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>dorsomedial anterior thalamus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>ventral tegmental area</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>interpeduncular nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>raphe nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>torus semicircularis pars laminaris</BrainRegion>, reptilian <BrainRegion>A8 nucleus/substantia nigra</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>central gray</BrainRegion>. For instance, only the <BrainRegion>medial septal nucleus</BrainRegion> projected substantially to the <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion> whereas the <BrainRegion>anterior septum</BrainRegion> was the only nucleus projecting to the <BrainRegion>caudal midbrain</BrainRegion> including the <BrainRegion>central gray</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>anterior</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>lateral septal nuclei</BrainRegion> also differ in the way in which their projection to the <BrainRegion>preoptic hypothalamus</BrainRegion> terminated. The <BrainRegion>midline septal division</BrainRegion> is composed of the <BrainRegion>dorsal septal nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>nucleus septalis impar</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>nucleus of the posterior pallial commissure</BrainRegion>. The latter two nuclei projected to the <BrainRegion>lateral habenula</BrainRegion> and, at least the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the posterior pallial commissure</BrainRegion>, to the <BrainRegion>mammillary complex</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>dorsal septal nucleus</BrainRegion> projected to the <BrainRegion>preoptic and periventricular hypothalamus</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>anterior thalamus</BrainRegion>, but its central part seemed to project to the <BrainRegion>caudal midbrain</BrainRegion> (up to the midbrain <BrainRegion>central gray</BrainRegion>). Finally, the <BrainRegion>ventromedial septal division</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>ventromedial septal nucleus</BrainRegion>) showed a massive projection to the <BrainRegion>anterior and the lateral tuberomammillary hypothalamus</BrainRegion>. Data on the connections of the <BrainRegion>septum</BrainRegion> of P. hispanica and Gecko gekko are discussed from a comparative point of view and used for better understanding of the functional anatomy of the tetrapodian <BrainRegion>septum</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Prefrontal cortical</BrainRegion> projections to the <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion> in macaque monkeys.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The organization of projections from the macaque <BrainRegion>orbital and medial prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion> (OMPFC) to the <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion> and related regions of the <BrainRegion>diencephalon</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>midbrain</BrainRegion> was studied with retrograde and anterograde tracing techniques. Almost all of the <BrainRegion>prefrontal cortical</BrainRegion> projections to the <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion> arise from areas within the &quot;<BrainRegion>medial prefrontal network</BrainRegion>,&quot; as defined previously by Carmichael and Price ([1996] J. Comp. Neurol. 371:179-207). Outside of the <BrainRegion>orbital and medial prefrontal cortex(</BrainRegion>OMPFC) , only a few neurons in the <BrainRegion>temporal pole</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>anterior cingulate</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>insular cortex</BrainRegion> project to the <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion>. Axons from the <BrainRegion>orbital and medial prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion>(OMPFC) also innervate the <BrainRegion>basal forebrain</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>zona incerta</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>ventral midbrain</BrainRegion>. Within the <BrainRegion>medial prefrontal network</BrainRegion>, different regions project to distinct parts of the <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion>. The medial wall <BrainRegion>areas 25</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>32</BrainRegion> send the heaviest projections to the <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion>; axons from these areas are especially concentrated in the <BrainRegion>anterior hypothalamic area</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>. <BrainRegion>Orbital areas 13a</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>12o</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>Iai</BrainRegion>, which are related to the <BrainRegion>medial prefrontal network</BrainRegion>, selectively innervate the <BrainRegion>lateral hypothalamic area</BrainRegion>, especially its posterior part. The cellular regions of the <BrainRegion>paraventricular</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>supraoptic</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>arcuate</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>mammillary nuclei</BrainRegion> are conspicuously devoid of <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> axons, but many axons abut the borders of these nuclei and may contact dendrites that extend from them. Areas within the <BrainRegion>orbital prefrontal network on the posterior orbital surface</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>agranular insula</BrainRegion> send only weak projections to the <BrainRegion>posterior lateral hypothalamic area</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>rostral orbital surface</BrainRegion> does not contribute to the cortico-hypothalamic projection.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Prefrontal cortical</BrainRegion> projections to <BrainRegion>longitudinal columns in the midbrain periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion> in macaque monkeys.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The origin and termination of <BrainRegion>prefrontal cortical</BrainRegion> projections to the <BrainRegion>periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion> (PAG) were defined with retrograde axonal tracers injected into the <BrainRegion>periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion>(PAG) and anterograde axonal tracers injected into the <BrainRegion>prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion> (PFC). The retrograde tracer experiments demonstrate projections to the <BrainRegion>periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion>(PAG) that arise primarily from the <BrainRegion>medial prefrontal areas 25, 32, and 10m</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>anterior cingulate</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>dorsomedial areas 24b and 9</BrainRegion>, select <BrainRegion>orbital areas 14c, 13a, Iai, 12o</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>caudal 12l</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>ventrolateral area 6v</BrainRegion>. Only scattered cells were retrogradely labeled in other areas in the <BrainRegion>prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion>(PFC) . Caudal to the <BrainRegion>prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion>(PFC) , projections to the <BrainRegion>periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion>(PAG) also arise from the <BrainRegion>posterior cingulate cortex</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>dorsal dysgranular</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>granular parts of the temporal polar cortex</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>ventral insula</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>dorsal bank of the superior temporal sulcus</BrainRegion>. Cells were also labeled in subcortical structures, including the <BrainRegion>central nucleus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>ventrolateral part of the basal nucleus of the amygdala</BrainRegion>. The anterograde tracer experiments indicate that projections from distinct <BrainRegion>cortical areas</BrainRegion> terminate primarily in <BrainRegion>individual longitudinal periaqueductal gray(PAG) columns</BrainRegion>. The projections from <BrainRegion>medial prefrontal areas 10m, 25, and 32</BrainRegion> end predominantly in the <BrainRegion>dorsolateral columns</BrainRegion>, bilaterally. Fibers from <BrainRegion>orbital areas 13a, Iai, 12o</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>caudal 12l</BrainRegion> terminate primarily in the <BrainRegion>ventrolateral column</BrainRegion>, whereas fibers from <BrainRegion>dorsomedial areas 9 and 24b</BrainRegion> terminate mainly in the <BrainRegion>lateral column</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>prefrontal cortex(PFC) areas</BrainRegion> that project to the <BrainRegion>periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion>(PAG) include most of the areas previously defined as the &quot;<BrainRegion>medial prefrontal network</BrainRegion>.&quot; The areas that comprise this network represent a visceromotor system, distinct from the sensory related "<BrainRegion>orbital network</BrainRegion>.&quot;</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Periaqueductal gray matter</BrainRegion> projection to the <BrainRegion>parabrachial nucleus</BrainRegion> in rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The efferent projections from the <BrainRegion>periaqueductal gray matter</BrainRegion> (PAG) to the <BrainRegion>parabrachial nucleus</BrainRegion> (PB) were studied in the rat following microinjections of the anterograde axonal tracer Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) into restricted regions of the <BrainRegion>periaqueductal gray matter</BrainRegion>(PAG) . The <BrainRegion>dorsomedial and dorsolateral periaqueductal gray matter</BrainRegion>(PAG) columns project almost exclusively to the <BrainRegion>superior lateral parabrachial nucleus(PB) subnucleus</BrainRegion>, whereas the <BrainRegion>lateral and ventrolateral periaqueductal gray matter</BrainRegion>(PAG) columns project to five lateral <BrainRegion>parabrachial nucleus</BrainRegion>(PB) sites: <BrainRegion>dorsal lateral subnucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>medial and lateral crescent areas</BrainRegion> (which flank the <BrainRegion>dorsal lateral parabrachial nucleus(PB) subnucleus</BrainRegion>), <BrainRegion>central lateral subnucleus</BrainRegion> (rostral portion), and <BrainRegion>superior lateral subnucleus</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>periaqueductal gray matter</BrainRegion>(PAG) region lying near the <BrainRegion>cerebral aqueduct</BrainRegion> projects to five <BrainRegion>lateral parabrachial nucleus</BrainRegion>(PB) sites: <BrainRegion>external lateral subnucleus</BrainRegion> (inner subdivision), <BrainRegion>medial and lateral crescent areas</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>central lateral subnucleus</BrainRegion> (rostral portion), and <BrainRegion>dorsal lateral subnucleus</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>internal lateral parabrachial nucleus(PB) subnucleus</BrainRegion>, which projects exclusively to the <BrainRegion>intralaminar thalamic nuclei</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>Kölliker-Fuse nucleus</BrainRegion> were not innervated by the <BrainRegion>periaqueductal gray matter</BrainRegion>(PAG) . The <BrainRegion>periaqueductal gray matter</BrainRegion>(PAG) selectively innervates individual <BrainRegion>parabrachial nucleus(PB) subnuclei</BrainRegion> that may be part of the spino-parachio-forebrain pathway. All <BrainRegion>periaqueductal gray matter</BrainRegion>(PAG) columns, including the <BrainRegion>aqueductal region</BrainRegion>, project to the <BrainRegion>superior lateral parabrachial nucleus(PB) subnucleus</BrainRegion>, a presumed nociceptive relay site that receives inputs from multiple <BrainRegion>spinal cord regions</BrainRegion> (laminae I, V, and VIII) and projects to the <BrainRegion>ventromedial and retrochiasmatic hypothalamic areas</BrainRegion>-two regions that have been implicated in complex goal-directed behavior (e.g., food intake and reproductive function). Earlier studies demonstrated that the <BrainRegion>dorsal lateral and external lateral parabrachial nucleus(PB) subnuclei</BrainRegion> (inner division) receive overlapping inputs from the <BrainRegion>superficial dorsal horn</BrainRegion> (laminae I and II) and the <BrainRegion>nucleus tractus solitarius</BrainRegion>, and both <BrainRegion>parabrachial nucleus(PB) subnuclei</BrainRegion> send projections to <BrainRegion>limbic forebrain areas</BrainRegion> (e.g., <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>preoptic region</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>amygdala</BrainRegion>). Because the <BrainRegion>periaqueductal gray matter</BrainRegion>(PAG) projects to both of these <BrainRegion>parabrachial nucleus(PB) subnuclei</BrainRegion>, this projection system possibly functions as a behavioral state-dependent filter system that modulates ascending nociceptive and/or visceral information as it is relayed through the <BrainRegion>parabrachial nucleus</BrainRegion>(PB) to <BrainRegion>forebrain sites</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Auditory connections and neurochemistry of the <BrainRegion>sagulum</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>We studied the cytoarchitecture, neurochemical organization, and connections of the <BrainRegion>sagulum</BrainRegion>. The goal was to clarify its role in <BrainRegion>midbrain</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>lateral tegmental</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> auditory processing. On cytoarchitectonic grounds, <BrainRegion>ventrolateral (parvocellular) and dorsomedial (magnocellular) subdivisions</BrainRegion> were recognized. The patterns of immunostaining for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glycine were distinct. Approximately 5-10% of the neurons were gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) ergic, and more than one type was identified; gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) ergic axon terminals were abundant in number and varied in form. Glycinergic neurons were much rarer, &amp;lt; 1% of the population, and glycinergic axon terminals were correspondingly sparse. Wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase was used for purposes of connectional mapping, and biotinylated dextran amines revealed the structure of corticosagular axons. All nine <BrainRegion>cortical areas</BrainRegion> injected project to the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral sagulum</BrainRegion>. Five <BrainRegion>(areas AI</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>AII</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>SF</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>EPD</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>Te</BrainRegion>) had heavier projections than the others. <BrainRegion>Areas AI</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>AII</BrainRegion> projected throughout the <BrainRegion>rostrocaudal sagulum</BrainRegion>. Labeling from <BrainRegion>AI</BrainRegion> was moderate in density and concentrated in the <BrainRegion>central sagulum</BrainRegion>, whereas the input from <BrainRegion>AII</BrainRegion> was heavier and ended more laterally. <BrainRegion>Suprasylvian fringe</BrainRegion> input was light, especially caudally, and was chiefly in the <BrainRegion>central sagulum</BrainRegion>. The projection from the <BrainRegion>dorsal region of the posterior ectosylvian gyrus</BrainRegion> was comparatively stronger and was in the <BrainRegion>dorsolateral sagulum</BrainRegion>. Finally, the <BrainRegion>temporal cortex</BrainRegion> sent axons to the most <BrainRegion>lateral sagulum</BrainRegion>, spanning the dorsoventral extent, whereas <BrainRegion>insular cortex</BrainRegion> axons ended diffusely in the <BrainRegion>dorsolateral sagulum</BrainRegion>. Corticofugal axons ranged from fine boutons en passant to larger globular terminals. The <BrainRegion>sagulum</BrainRegion> may represent the earliest significant opportunity in the ascending auditory pathway for corticofugal modulation. The most extensive input arises from the <BrainRegion>polymodal association areas</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>sagulum</BrainRegion> then projects divergently to the <BrainRegion>dorsal cortex</BrainRegion> of the <BrainRegion>inferior colliculus</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>dorsal division of the medial geniculate body</BrainRegion>. The projection from the <BrainRegion>dorsal division of the auditory thalamus</BrainRegion> to <BrainRegion>nonprimary auditory cortex</BrainRegion> completes this circuit between the <BrainRegion>forebrain</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>midbrain</BrainRegion> and represents a nexus in the ascending and descending auditory systems. Such circuits could play a critical role in auditory-motor adjustments to sound.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Cortical</BrainRegion> connections of <BrainRegion>striate and extrastriate visual areas</BrainRegion> in tree shrews.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The ipsilateral and contralateral <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> connections of <BrainRegion>visual cortex</BrainRegion> of tree shrews (Tupaia belangeri) were investigated by placing restricted injections of fluorochrome tracers, wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase, or biotinylated dextran amine into <BrainRegion>area 17</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>V1</BrainRegion>), <BrainRegion>area 18</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>V2</BrainRegion>), or the adjoining <BrainRegion>temporal dorsal area</BrainRegion> (TD). As previously reported, <BrainRegion>V1</BrainRegion> was characterized by a widespread, patchy pattern of intrinsic connections; ipsilateral connections with <BrainRegion>V2</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>temporal dorsal area</BrainRegion>(TD) , and to a lesser extent, other areas of the <BrainRegion>temporal cortex</BrainRegion>; and contralateral connections with <BrainRegion>V1</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>V2</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>temporal dorsal area</BrainRegion>(TD) . A surface-view of the myelin pattern in <BrainRegion>V1</BrainRegion> revealed a patchwork of light and dark module-like regions. The ipsilateral connections with <BrainRegion>V2</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>temporal dorsal area</BrainRegion>(TD) were roughly topographic, whereas heterotopic locations in <BrainRegion>V1</BrainRegion> were callosally connected. Injections in <BrainRegion>V2</BrainRegion> labeled as much as one third of <BrainRegion>V2</BrainRegion> in a patchy pattern, and portions of <BrainRegion>ipsilateral V1</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>temporal dorsal area</BrainRegion>(TD) in roughly topographic patterns. In addition, connections with several other <BrainRegion>visual areas in the temporal lobe</BrainRegion> were revealed. Contralaterally, most of the label was in <BrainRegion>V2</BrainRegion>, with some in <BrainRegion>V1</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>temporal dorsal area</BrainRegion>(TD) . Injections in <BrainRegion>temporal dorsal area</BrainRegion>(TD) demonstrated connections within the region, and with adjoining portions of the <BrainRegion>temporal cortex</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>V2</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>V1</BrainRegion>. There were sparse connections with an oval of densely myelinated <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion>, which we have termed the <BrainRegion>temporal inferior area</BrainRegion> (TI). <BrainRegion>Callosal</BrainRegion> connections were concentrated in <BrainRegion>temporal dorsal area</BrainRegion>(TD) , but also included <BrainRegion>V2</BrainRegion>. The results provide further evidence for modular organizations within <BrainRegion>V1</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>V2</BrainRegion>, and reveal for the first time the complete patterns of <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> connections of <BrainRegion>V2</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>temporal dorsal area</BrainRegion>(TD) . The results are consistent with the proposal that at least three visual areas, the <BrainRegion>temporal anterior area</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>TA</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>temporal dorsal area</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>temporal dorsal area</BrainRegion>(TD) , and the <BrainRegion>temporal posterior area</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>TP</BrainRegion>, exist along the <BrainRegion>rostrolateral border of V2</BrainRegion> in tree shrews; suggest visual involvement of at least three other areas, the <BrainRegion>temporal inferior area</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>temporal inferior area</BrainRegion>(TI) , the <BrainRegion>temporal anterior lateral area</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>temporal posterior inferior area</BrainRegion> located more ventrally in the <BrainRegion>temporal cortex</BrainRegion>; and fortify the conclusion that <BrainRegion>temporal dorsal area</BrainRegion>(TD) is the likely homologue of the <BrainRegion>middle temporal visual area</BrainRegion> of primates. Because tree shrews are considered close relatives of primates, the evidence for several visual areas along the border of <BrainRegion>V2</BrainRegion> is more compatible with theories that propose a series of visual areas along <BrainRegion>V2</BrainRegion> in primates, rather than a single visual area, <BrainRegion>V3</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Brainstem</BrainRegion> inputs to the ferret <BrainRegion>medial geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion> and the effect of early deafferentation on novel <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> projections to the <BrainRegion>auditory thalamus</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Following specific neonatal brain lesions in rodents and ferrets, <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> axons have been induced to innervate the <BrainRegion>medial geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion> (MGN). Previous studies have suggested that reduction of normal <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> targets along with deafferentation of the <BrainRegion>medial geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(MGN) are two concurrent factors required for the induction of novel <BrainRegion>retino- medial geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(MGN) projections. We have examined, in ferrets, the relative influence of these two factors on the extent of the novel <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> projection. We first characterized the inputs to the normal <BrainRegion>medial geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(MGN) , and the most effective combination of neonatal lesions to deafferent this nucleus, by injecting retrograde tracers into the <BrainRegion>medial geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(MGN) of normal and neonatally operated adult ferrets, respectively. In a second group of experiments, newborn ferrets received different combinations of lesions of normal <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> targets and <BrainRegion>medial geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(MGN) afferents. The resulting extent of <BrainRegion>retino- medial geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(MGN) projections was estimated for each case at adulthood, by using intraocular injections of anterograde tracers. We found that the extent of <BrainRegion>retino- medial geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(MGN) projections correlates well with the extent of <BrainRegion>medial geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(MGN) deafferentation, but not with extent of removal of normal <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> targets. Indeed, the presence of at least some normal <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> targets seems necessary for the formation of <BrainRegion>retino- medial geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(MGN) connections. The diameters of <BrainRegion>retino- medial geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(MGN) axons suggest that more than one type of <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> ganglion cells innervate the <BrainRegion>medial geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(MGN) under a lesion paradigm that spares the <BrainRegion>visual cortex</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>. We also found that, after extensive deafferentation of <BrainRegion>medial geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(MGN) , other axonal systems in addition to <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> axons project ectopically to the <BrainRegion>medial geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(MGN) . These data are consistent with the idea that ectopic <BrainRegion>retino- medial geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(MGN) projections develop by sprouting of axon collaterals in response to signals arising from the deafferented nucleus, and that these axons compete with other sets of axons for terminal space in the <BrainRegion>medial geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(MGN) .</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Parvalbumin is expressed in a reciprocal circuit linking the <BrainRegion>medial geniculate body</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>auditory neocortex</BrainRegion> in the rabbit.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Recent studies of the rabbit <BrainRegion>auditory forebrain</BrainRegion> have shown that antibodies directed against the calcium-binding protein parvalbumin (PV) specifically demarcate <BrainRegion>auditory neocortex</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>ventral division of the medial geniculate body</BrainRegion> (MGV). The <BrainRegion>auditory cortex</BrainRegion> is characterized by two parvalbumin(PV) - immunoreactive bands: dense terminal-like labeling within layer III/IV and a prominent band of parvalbumin(PV) + somata in the upper half of layer VI. In some cases, there are distinct patches of parvalbumin(PV) immunoreactivity within layers III/IV of <BrainRegion>auditory cortex</BrainRegion> that appear similar to the patchy termination of thalamocortical axons labeled by the injection of anterograde tracers into <BrainRegion>MGV</BrainRegion>. The presence of parvalbumin(PV) + patches in III/IV, parvalbumin(PV) + somata in layer VI, and the high density of parvalbumin(PV) + neurons and terminals in the <BrainRegion>MGV</BrainRegion> suggest the existence of a reciprocal parvalbumin(PV) + circuit linking <BrainRegion>primary auditory cortex</BrainRegion> (AI) and the <BrainRegion>MGV</BrainRegion>. In the present study, double-labeling experiments in adult rabbits were carried out to provide evidence for this circuit. Focal injections of the tracers biocytin or biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) into the <BrainRegion>MGV</BrainRegion> labeled thalamocortical afferent patches within layer III/IV and retrogradely labeled corticothalamic neurons in layer VIa of the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral auditory cortex</BrainRegion>. Adjacent sections stained with antibodies against parvalbumin(PV) revealed terminal-like parvalbumin(PV) -immunoreactive patches in III/IV and parvalbumin(PV) + somata in VIa that were in register with those labeled by biotinylated dextran amine(BDA) injections into the MGV. Serial section reconstruction of biotinylated dextran amine(BDA) -labeled corticothalamic neurons in VIa revealed pyramidal cells with tangentially oriented basal dendrites and sparsely branched apical dendrites that ascended to layer I. Fluorescent double-labeling studies demonstrated that a subpopulation of corticothalamic neurons also express parvalbumin(PV) . parvalbumin(PV) -negative corticothalamic neurons were also found. Discrete injections of biotinylated dextran amine(BDA) into <BrainRegion>auditory cortex</BrainRegion> labeled bands of neurons in the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral MGV</BrainRegion>, whose orientation paralleled the fibrodendritic laminae characteristic of this subdivision. Retrograde double-labeling experiments showed that most <BrainRegion>MGV</BrainRegion> relay neurons also express parvalbumin(PV) . Small numbers of parvalbumin(PV) -negative relay neurons were also found. These studies provide evidence for the existence of multiple, chemically coded pathways linking <BrainRegion>primary auditory cortex</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>MGV</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Connections of the <BrainRegion>dorsal zone of cat auditory cortex</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The present study examined the anatomic connections of the <BrainRegion>dorsal zone of cat auditory cortex</BrainRegion> (DZ). The <BrainRegion>DZ</BrainRegion> was discriminated physiologically from the <BrainRegion>primary auditory field</BrainRegion> (AI) on the basis of neuronal responses with long latency and broad or multipeaked tuning curves. Wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase was then injected either by pressure or iontophoretically. The thalamocortical and corticothalamic connections of the <BrainRegion>DZ</BrainRegion> were visualized by the presence of retrogradely labeled neurons and anterogradely labeled terminal fields in the <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion>; ipsilateral corticocortical projections from other <BrainRegion>cortical fields</BrainRegion> were visualized by the presence of retrogradely labeled cells. Injections of tracer into the <BrainRegion>DZ</BrainRegion> retrogradely labeled cells mainly in the <BrainRegion>lateral division of posterior complex</BrainRegion> (Po) and in the <BrainRegion>dorsal division (MGd) of the medial geniculate body</BrainRegion> (MGB); fewer labeled cells were found in the <BrainRegion>ventral (MGv) and medial (MGm) divisions of the medial geniculate body</BrainRegion>(MGB) and in the <BrainRegion>suprageniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>DZ</BrainRegion> projection to <BrainRegion>posterior complex</BrainRegion>(Po) , <BrainRegion>MGv</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>MGd</BrainRegion> was heavy and was more diffuse than the reciprocal thalamocortical projection; the projection to <BrainRegion>MGm</BrainRegion> was light. The corticothalamic terminations and thalamocortical cells projecting to the same part of the <BrainRegion>DZ</BrainRegion> were not superimposed rigidly. The <BrainRegion>DZ</BrainRegion> received <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> projections from <BrainRegion>auditory field</BrainRegion>(AI) and from the <BrainRegion>second, anterior, and posterior auditory fields</BrainRegion>, and there were strong intra-<BrainRegion>DZ</BrainRegion> connections. Together with the physiological findings, the present results suggest that the <BrainRegion>DZ</BrainRegion> is a potentially separate auditory field from auditory field(<BrainRegion>AI</BrainRegion>) and is likely to be involved in both temporal and spectral integration of acoustic information.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Thalamocortical connections of the <BrainRegion>parabelt auditory cortex</BrainRegion> in macaque monkeys.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The <BrainRegion>auditory cortex</BrainRegion> of macaque monkeys contains a core of primary-like areas surrounded by a narrow belt of associated fields that encompass much of the <BrainRegion>superior temporal plane</BrainRegion> in these animals. Adjacent to the lateral belt on the <BrainRegion>superior temporal gyrus</BrainRegion> is a parabelt region that contains at least two subdivisions (rostral and caudal). In a previous study (Hackett et al. [1998] J. Comp. Neurol. 394:475-495), we determined that the parabelt has topographic connections with the belt areas surrounding the core, but minimal connections with the core itself. In this study, we describe the thalamocortical connections of the <BrainRegion>parabelt auditory cortex</BrainRegion> based on multiple injections of neuronal tracers into this region in each of five macaque monkeys. Injections confined to the parabelt labeled large numbers of neurons in the dorsal (<BrainRegion>MGd</BrainRegion>) and magnocellular (<BrainRegion>MGm</BrainRegion>) divisions of the <BrainRegion>medial geniculate complex</BrainRegion> (MGC), <BrainRegion>suprageniculate</BrainRegion> (Sg), <BrainRegion>limitans</BrainRegion> (Lim), and <BrainRegion>medial pulvinar (PM) nuclei</BrainRegion>. Only when injections encroached on the <BrainRegion>lateral belt cortex</BrainRegion> were substantial numbers of labeled neurons found in the ventral (<BrainRegion>MGv</BrainRegion>) division of the medial geniculate complex(MGC) , consistent with the absence of significant connections between the <BrainRegion>parabelt</BrainRegion> and core fields. The rostrocaudal topography of the parabelt region was maintained in the thalamocortical connections, supporting the parcellation of this region of cortex. The results suggest that the parabelt region represents a third level of auditory cortical processing, which is not influenced by direct inputs from <BrainRegion>primary cortical or subcortical auditory structures</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Timing and origin of the first <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> axons to project through the <BrainRegion>corpus callosum</BrainRegion> and the subsequent emergence of <BrainRegion>callosal</BrainRegion> projection cells in mouse.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>A precise knowledge of the timing and origin of the first <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> axons to project through the <BrainRegion>corpus callosum</BrainRegion> (CC) and of the subsequent emergence of <BrainRegion>callosal</BrainRegion> projection cells is essential for understanding the early ontogeny of this commissure. By using a series of mouse embryos and fetuses of the hybrid cross B6D2F2/J weighing from 0.36 g to 1.0 g (embryonic day E15.75-E17.25), we examined the spatial and temporal distribution of <BrainRegion>callosal</BrainRegion> projection cells by inserting crystals of the lipophilic dye (DiI: 1,1&apos;-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate) into the <BrainRegion>contralateral white matter just lateral to the midsagittal plane</BrainRegion>. Around 0.4 g or E15.8, retrogradely labeled cells were found restricted to a discrete cluster continuously distributed from the most <BrainRegion>ventral part of presumptive cingulate cortex</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion>. During subsequent development, however, the tangential distribution of these labeled cells in <BrainRegion>ventromedial cortex</BrainRegion> did not extend further dorsally, and in fetuses where the <BrainRegion>corpus callosum</BrainRegion>(CC) became distinct from the <BrainRegion>hippocampal commissure</BrainRegion> (HC), labeled axons of cells in the <BrainRegion>ventral cingulate cortex</BrainRegion> were observed to intersect the <BrainRegion>callosal pathway</BrainRegion> and merge with labeled axons of the <BrainRegion>hippocampal commissure</BrainRegion>(HC) derived from cells in the <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion>. The first <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> axons through the <BrainRegion>corpus callosum</BrainRegion>(CC) crossed the midline at about 0.64 g or E16.4, and these axons originated from a scattered neuronal population in the <BrainRegion>dorsal to lateral part of the presumptive frontal cortex</BrainRegion>. The earliest <BrainRegion>callosal</BrainRegion> cells were consistently located in the cortical plate and showed an immature bipolar appearance, displaying an ovoid- or pearl-shaped perikaryon with an apical dendrite coursing in a zig-zagging manner toward the pial surface and a slender axon directed toward the underlying white matter. <BrainRegion>Callosal</BrainRegion> projection cells spread progressively with development across the tangential extent of the <BrainRegion>cerebral cortex</BrainRegion> in both lateral-to-medial and rostral-to-caudal directions. In any <BrainRegion>cortical region</BrainRegion>, the first labeled cells appeared in the <BrainRegion>cortical plate</BrainRegion> and their number in the subplate was insignificant compared to that in the <BrainRegion>cortical plate</BrainRegion>. Thus, these results clarify that the <BrainRegion>corpus callosum</BrainRegion>(CC) is pioneered by <BrainRegion>frontal cortical plate</BrainRegion> cells, and the subsequent ontogeny of <BrainRegion>callosal</BrainRegion> projection cells proceeds according to the gradient of <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> maturation.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Auditory cortical</BrainRegion> projections to the cat <BrainRegion>inferior colliculus</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The projection from 11 <BrainRegion>auditory cortical areas</BrainRegion> onto the subdivisions of the <BrainRegion>inferior colliculus</BrainRegion> was studied in adult cats by using two different anterograde tracers to label cortico-collicular (CC) axon terminals. The main results were that: 1) a significant cortico-collicular(CC) projection arose from every field; 2) the principal <BrainRegion>inferior collicular</BrainRegion> targets were the <BrainRegion>dorsal cortex</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>lateral nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>caudal cortex</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>intercollicular tegmentum</BrainRegion>, with only a sparse projection to the <BrainRegion>central nucleus</BrainRegion>; 3) the input was usually bilateral, with the ipsilateral side by far the most heavily labeled, and the contralateral projection was a symmetrical subset of the ipsilateral input; 4) the cortico-collicular(CC) system is both divergent and convergent, with single <BrainRegion>cortical areas</BrainRegion> projecting to six or more <BrainRegion>collicular subdivisions</BrainRegion>, and each <BrainRegion>auditory midbrain subdivision</BrainRegion> receiving a convergent projection from two to ten <BrainRegion>cortical areas</BrainRegion>; 5) <BrainRegion>cortical areas</BrainRegion> devoid of tonotopic organization have topographic projections to <BrainRegion>collicular target nuclei</BrainRegion>; 6) the heaviest cortico-collicular(CC) projection terminated in the <BrainRegion>caudal half of the inferior colliculus</BrainRegion>; and finally, 7) the relative strength of the cortico-collicular labeling was far less than that of the corresponding corticothalamic projection in the same experiments. The cortico-collicular(CC) system is strategically placed to influence both descending and ascending pathways arising in the <BrainRegion>inferior colliculus</BrainRegion>. Nuclei that participate in the premotor system, like the <BrainRegion>inferior collicular</BrainRegion> subdivisions that project to the <BrainRegion>pons</BrainRegion>, receive substantial corticofugal input. Both the <BrainRegion>dorsal (pericentral) and the lateral (external) nuclei of the inferior colliculus</BrainRegion> project to parts of the <BrainRegion>medial geniculate body</BrainRegion> whose closest auditory affiliations are with non-tonotopic <BrainRegion>cortical regions</BrainRegion> involved in higher order auditory perception. The cortico-collicular system may link <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion> and colliculo-thalamic circuits to coordinate <BrainRegion>premotor</BrainRegion> and perceptual aspects of hearing.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Postmortem tracing reveals the organization of <BrainRegion>hypothalamic</BrainRegion> projections of the <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion> in the human brain.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion> (SCN) is a small structure considered to be the site of the major circadian pacemaker of the mammalian brain. Disturbances in human biological clock function may occur in several diseases, such as Alzheimer&apos;s disease, sleep problems, and seasonal depression. Since basic knowledge of the anatomical connections of the human <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion>(SCN) is limited due to the lack of suitable neuroanatomical tracing methods, the understanding of physiological mechanisms of human <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion>(SCN) function has obviously been hampered. In the present study, the <BrainRegion>hypothalamic</BrainRegion> connections of the human <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion>(SCN) were revealed for the first time with a newly developed in vitro postmortem anterograde tracing method. The human <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion>(SCN) was found to be connected with <BrainRegion>nuclei in the hypothalamus</BrainRegion> that are involved in hormone secretion, cardiovascular regulation, and behavior activity. These human <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion>(SCN) projections appear to follow the same general patterns as those in the rodent brain. This homology may indicate an evolutionary conservation of the <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion>(SCN) projections from rodent to human. Through these connections, the human <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion>(SCN) may transmit its circadian information to regulate hormone secretion, body temperature, and behavioral functions as it does in animal species. In addition, the postmortem tracing technique may be a valuable tool that will contribute to our understanding of anatomical connections in the human brain, and may have other applications in the research on the physiology and pathology of the human brain.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Cortical</BrainRegion> connections of the <BrainRegion>dorsomedial visual area</BrainRegion> in new world owl monkeys (Aotus trivirgatus) and squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus).</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The <BrainRegion>dorsomedial visual area</BrainRegion> (DM) is an <BrainRegion>extrastriate area</BrainRegion> that was originally described in owl monkeys as a complete representation of the visual hemifield in a heavily myelinated wedge of <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion> just rostral to <BrainRegion>dorsomedial visual area V2</BrainRegion>. More recently, connections of <BrainRegion>dorsomedial visual area</BrainRegion>(DM) in owl monkeys have been described (Krubitzer and Kaas [1993] J. Comp. Neurol 334:497-528). As part of an effort to determine whether <BrainRegion>dorsomedial visual area</BrainRegion>(DM) exists in other primates, we compared the architecture, connections, and visual topography of <BrainRegion>dorsomedial visual area</BrainRegion>(DM) in owl monkeys and the presumptive <BrainRegion>dorsomedial visual area</BrainRegion>(DM) in squirrel monkeys. In both species of New World monkeys, the <BrainRegion>dorsomedial visual area</BrainRegion>(DM) region was more heavily myelinated than adjacent <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion>, and this region was connected with the <BrainRegion>first and second visual areas</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>middle temporal area</BrainRegion> (MT), the <BrainRegion>medial area</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>ventral posterior parietal area</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>dorsointermediate area</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>dorsolateral area</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>ventral posterior and ventral anterior areas</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>medial superior temporal area</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>fundal area of the superior temporal sulcus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>inferior temporal cortex</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>frontal cortex in or near the frontal eye field</BrainRegion>. In squirrel monkeys, both blob and interblob regions of <BrainRegion>V1</BrainRegion> contributed equally to <BrainRegion>dorsomedial visual area</BrainRegion>(DM) , whereas the blob regions provided most of the projections to <BrainRegion>V1</BrainRegion> in owl monkeys. In squirrel monkeys, connections were also found with <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion> on the <BrainRegion>ventral surface in the ventral occipital temporal sulcus</BrainRegion>. In owl monkeys and squirrel monkeys, connections were with both the upper and lower visual field representations in <BrainRegion>V1</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>V2</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>middle temporal area</BrainRegion>(MT) , demonstrating that <BrainRegion>dorsomedial visual area</BrainRegion>(DM) contains a complete representation of the visual field. These similarities in architecture, connections, and retinotopy argue that <BrainRegion>dorsomedial visual area</BrainRegion>(DM) is a visual area of both owl and squirrel monkeys.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Input-output connections of the &quot;hindlimb" region of the <BrainRegion>inferior olive</BrainRegion> in cats.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The aim of the present study was to establish whether <BrainRegion>gracile</BrainRegion> afferents to the <BrainRegion>inferior olive</BrainRegion> are topographically organized and whether such inputs coincide with the location of cells that output to the <BrainRegion>hindlimb C1 zone in the cerebellar posterior lobe</BrainRegion>. Small injections (n=15) of the anterograde tracers Fluoro-Ruby or biotinylated dextran amine were made into <BrainRegion>gracile</BrainRegion>, resulting in anterograde labelling often distributed in partially separate, rostrocaudally directed columns within the lateral half of the <BrainRegion>contralateral rostral dorsal accessory olive</BrainRegion> (rDAO). In 12 cases, anterograde labelling was also located within the <BrainRegion>caudolateral medial accessory olive</BrainRegion>. Evidence for a topographical organization was obtained, suggesting that <BrainRegion>medial gracile</BrainRegion> targets only the <BrainRegion>most lateral part of rostral dorsal accessory olive</BrainRegion>(<BrainRegion>rDAO</BrainRegion>) , whereas <BrainRegion>lateral gracile</BrainRegion> also targets more medial parts. <BrainRegion>Gracile</BrainRegion> injections centred dorsally also resulted in more extensive terminal fields in <BrainRegion>rostral dorsal accessory olive</BrainRegion>(rDAO) than similar sized injections centred ventrally which may relate to the representation of the distal hindlimb in <BrainRegion>dorsal gracile</BrainRegion> (e.g., Millar and Basbaum, 1975). Injections of retrograde tracer (green beads) into the <BrainRegion>C1 zone in the ipsilateral caudal paramedian lobule</BrainRegion> (7 cases), resulted in retrograde cell labelling in the <BrainRegion>middle one-third of contralateral DAO</BrainRegion> in two columns that fused caudally. The proportion of labelled cells that overlapped with anterograde labelled terminals was related to the dorsoventral locus of the <BrainRegion>gracile</BrainRegion> injection site: <BrainRegion>gracile</BrainRegion> injections centred dorsally produced the largest degree of overlap and therefore, potentially, the greatest functional convergence. In summary, the results suggest that a topographical organization is present within the gracilo-olivo-cerebellar projection which is discussed in relation to the functional organization of the olivocerebellar system.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Cascade projections</BrainRegion> from <BrainRegion>somatosensory cortex</BrainRegion> to the rat <BrainRegion>basolateral amygdala</BrainRegion> via the <BrainRegion>parietal insular cortex</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The pathways by which somatosensory information could be relayed from the <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>amygdaloid complex</BrainRegion> were investigated by using the anterograde axonal transport of biocytin following <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> microinjections. Injections of biocytin into head and limb areas of <BrainRegion>secondary somatosensory cortex</BrainRegion> (S2) produced heavy labeling of fibers and terminals in <BrainRegion>granular and dysgranular parietal insular cortex</BrainRegion> from bregma to 3.8 mm behind bregma but only extremely sparse labeling in the <BrainRegion>lateral and basolateral amygdaloid nuclei</BrainRegion>. Biocytin injections into <BrainRegion>granular parietal insular cortex</BrainRegion> produced a heavy labeling of the subjacent <BrainRegion>dysgranular parietal insular cortex</BrainRegion>, but only sparse labeling in the <BrainRegion>basolateral amygdala</BrainRegion>. Biocytin injections into <BrainRegion>dysgranular parietal insular cortex</BrainRegion> resulted in heavy labeling of the subjacent <BrainRegion>agranular parietal insular cortex</BrainRegion> and strong labeling of fibers and terminals in the <BrainRegion>dorsal part of lateral nucleus</BrainRegion>, with moderate labeling of fibers in the <BrainRegion>anterior and posterior basolateral nuclei</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>central nucleus</BrainRegion>. Injections into <BrainRegion>S2</BrainRegion> labeled the <BrainRegion>ventroposterior medial</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>ventroposterior lateral and posterior thalamic nuclei</BrainRegion>; injections in <BrainRegion>rostral granular and dysgranular parietal insular cortex</BrainRegion> labeled the <BrainRegion>ventral posterior and parvicellular part of ventroposterior lateral thalamic nuclei</BrainRegion>; and injections in middle to <BrainRegion>caudal dysgranular parietal insular cortex</BrainRegion> labeled only the <BrainRegion>posterior nucleus</BrainRegion>. These results suggest that whereas <BrainRegion>somatosensory cortex</BrainRegion> projects only very sparsely to the <BrainRegion>amygdala</BrainRegion>, somatosensory-related inputs to the <BrainRegion>amygdala</BrainRegion> arise in the <BrainRegion>dysgranular parietal insular cortex</BrainRegion>. The association of <BrainRegion>dysgranular parietal insular cortex</BrainRegion> with the <BrainRegion>posterior thalamus</BrainRegion> suggests it may relay nociceptive information to the <BrainRegion>amygdala</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Cortical</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>amygdaloid</BrainRegion> connections of the <BrainRegion>anterior and posterior insular cortices</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText><BrainRegion>Cortical</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>amygdaloid</BrainRegion> projections of the rat <BrainRegion>anterior and posterior insular cortices</BrainRegion> were examined using the anterograde transport of biocytin. <BrainRegion>Granular and dysgranular posterior insular areas</BrainRegion> between <BrainRegion>bregma</BrainRegion> and 2 mm anterior to <BrainRegion>bregma</BrainRegion> projected to the <BrainRegion>gustatory thalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>. <BrainRegion>Granular cortex</BrainRegion> projected to the subjacent <BrainRegion>dysgranular cortex</BrainRegion> which in turn projected to the <BrainRegion>agranular (all layers) and granular cortices</BrainRegion> (layers I and VI). Both <BrainRegion>granular and dysgranular posterior areas</BrainRegion> projected heavily to the <BrainRegion>dysgranular anterior insular cortex</BrainRegion>. <BrainRegion>Agranular posterior insular cortex</BrainRegion> projected to <BrainRegion>medial mediodorsal nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>agranular anterior insular and infralimbic cortices</BrainRegion> as well as <BrainRegion>granular and dysgranular posterior insula</BrainRegion>. No projections to the <BrainRegion>amygdala</BrainRegion> were observed from <BrainRegion>posterior granular cortex</BrainRegion>, although <BrainRegion>dysgranular cortex</BrainRegion> projected to the <BrainRegion>lateral central nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>dorsolateral lateral nucleus</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>posterior basolateral nucleus</BrainRegion>. <BrainRegion>Agranular</BrainRegion> projections were similar, although they included <BrainRegion>medial and lateral central nucleus</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>ventral lateral nucleus</BrainRegion>. <BrainRegion>Dysgranular anterior insular cortex</BrainRegion> projected to <BrainRegion>lateral agranular frontal cortex</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>granular and dysgranular posterior insular regions</BrainRegion>. <BrainRegion>Agranular anterior insular cortex</BrainRegion> projected to the <BrainRegion>dysgranular anterior and prelimbic cortices</BrainRegion>. <BrainRegion>Anterior insuloamygdaloid</BrainRegion> projections targeted the <BrainRegion>rostral lateral and anterior basolateral nuclei</BrainRegion> with sparse projections to the <BrainRegion>rostral central nucleus</BrainRegion>. The data suggest that the <BrainRegion>anterior insula</BrainRegion> is an interface between the <BrainRegion>posterior insular cortex</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>motor cortex</BrainRegion> and is connected with motor-related <BrainRegion>amygdala</BrainRegion> regions. <BrainRegion>Amygdaloid</BrainRegion> projections from the <BrainRegion>posterior insular cortex</BrainRegion> appear to be organized in a feedforward parallel fashion targeting all levels of the <BrainRegion>intraamygdaloid</BrainRegion> connections linking the <BrainRegion>lateral, basolateral, and central nuclei</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Corticostriatal connections of the <BrainRegion>superior temporal region</BrainRegion> in rhesus monkeys.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Corticostriatal connections of <BrainRegion>auditory areas within the supratemporal plane</BrainRegion> and in <BrainRegion>rostral and caudal portions of the superior temporal gyrus</BrainRegion> were studied by the autoradiographic anterograde tracing technique. The results show that the <BrainRegion>primary auditory cortex</BrainRegion> has limited projections to the <BrainRegion>caudoventral putamen</BrainRegion> and to the <BrainRegion>tail of the caudate nucleus</BrainRegion>. In contrast, the <BrainRegion>second auditory area within the circular sulcus</BrainRegion> has connections to the <BrainRegion>rostral and the caudal putamen</BrainRegion> and to the <BrainRegion>body of the caudate nucleus and the tail</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>association areas of the superior temporal gyrus</BrainRegion> collectively have widespread corticostriatal projections characterized by differential topographic distributions. The <BrainRegion>rostral part of the gyrus</BrainRegion> projects to <BrainRegion>ventral portions of the head of the caudate nucleus and of the body and to the tail</BrainRegion>. In addition, there are connections to <BrainRegion>rostroventral and caudoventral portions of the putamen</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>mid-portion of the gyrus</BrainRegion> projects to similar <BrainRegion>striatal regions</BrainRegion>, but the connections to the <BrainRegion>head of the caudate nucleus</BrainRegion> are less extensive. Compared with the <BrainRegion>rostral and middle parts of the superior temporal gyrus</BrainRegion>, the caudal portion has little connectivity to the <BrainRegion>tail of the caudate nucleus</BrainRegion>. It projects more dorsally within the head and the body and also more dorsally within the <BrainRegion>caudal putamen</BrainRegion>. These differential patterns of corticostriatal connectivity are consistent with functional specialization at the <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> level.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Evolution of neuronal patterning in free-living rhabditid nematodes I: Sex-specific serotonin-containing neurons.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>As a first step toward understanding the evolution of neuronal patterning and function in a group of simple animals, we have examined serotonin-containing neurons in 17 species of free-living rhabditid nematodes and compared them with identified neurons of Caenorhabditis elegans. We found many serotonin-immunoreactive (serotonin-IR) neurons that are likely homologs of those in C. elegans; this paper focuses on sex-specific neurons such as the egg laying hermaphrodite-specific neurons (HSNs), VCs, and male CAs, CPs, and ray sensory neurons known to function in mating. These cells vary in number and position in the species examined but are consistent with a current molecularly based phylogeny. Two groups (Oscheius and Pristionchus) appear independently to have lost a serotonin-IR HSN. Oscheius furthermore has no serotonin-IR innervation of the vulval region, in contrast to every other species we examined. We also saw variation in the location of somas of putative HSN, consistent with evolutionary changes in HSN migration. In C. elegans, the HSN soma migrates during embryogenesis from the tail to the central body, where it innervates its major postsynaptic targets, the vulval muscles. For other species, we observed putative HSN homologs along the anterior-posterior axis from the head to the tail, but typically hermaphrodite-specific neurons(HSNs) were located near the vulva, which also varies in anterior-posterior position among the species we examined. The varying positions of the HSN somas in other species are reminiscent of phenotypes seen in various C. elegans mutants with altered HSN migration, suggesting possible mechanisms for the evolutionary differences we observed.

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Red nucleus</BrainRegion> of Macaca fascicularis: an electron microscopic study of its synaptic organization.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The <BrainRegion>parvicellular and magnocellular divisions of the red nucleus</BrainRegion> of the old world monkey, Macaca fascicularis, were analyzed at an electron microscopic level to examine the morphology of the synaptic profiles terminating on <BrainRegion>rubral</BrainRegion> neurons and to categorize them by their individual characteristics. The <BrainRegion>parvicellular division, or anterior two-thirds of the nucleus</BrainRegion>, is composed of small (10-15 microns) and medium-size (20-30 microns) cells, which are uniformly distributed with high packing density throughout this portion of the nucleus. These cells have invaginated nuclei and are often indented by blood vessels and glial cell somata (satellite cells) that lie in close proximity. The <BrainRegion>magnocellular portion, occupying the caudal one-third of the nucleus</BrainRegion>, is composed of an additional population of large cells, ranging from 50-90 microns in diameter, which often contain prominent lipofuscin granules and are frequently indented by blood vessels. Satellite glial cells are not a prominent feature in the <BrainRegion>magnocellularis portion of the nucleus</BrainRegion>. The large cells are separated one from the other by fields of myelinated axons either coursing through the nucleus or projecting to and from the nucleus itself. Although the divisions of the nucleus in the Macaca fascicularis are spatially distinct, each possesses a morphological similarity in regard to the categories of synaptic profiles seen at the electron microscopic level. These synaptic profiles are classified as follows: large terminals containing numerous, predominantly rounded vesicles (LR), which can often be seen to form the central profile in a synaptic glomerular arrangement; terminals of similar size with predominantly rounded vesicles but with a pale axoplasmic matrix (LRP); small profiles with rounded vesicles (SR); profiles containing granular dense-cored vesicles (DCV); profiles with numerous flattened vesicles (F); profiles containing pleomorphic vesicles (PL), some of which can be interpreted as presynaptic dendrites (PSD) because they are seen to be postsynaptic and contain ribosomes; and profiles with rounded synaptic vesicles, which are associated with subsynaptic Taxi bodies (T). Most of the various synaptic profile types were found to have similar distributions on the dendritic arbors of <BrainRegion>rubral</BrainRegion> neurons in both divisions of the nucleus. However, the LRP-type terminal predominates on the cell bodies and proximal dendrites of the large neurons in magnocellularis. Unlike other regions in the nervous system, F type terminals are rarely seen to contact neuronal somata. This study provides a basis for future experimental studies of afferents to the nucleus in this species.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Catecholamine innervation of the <BrainRegion>basal forebrain</BrainRegion>. II. <BrainRegion>Amygdala</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>suprarhinal cortex</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>entorhinal cortex</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The catecholamine (CA) innervation of the <BrainRegion>posterior basal forebrain</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>amygdala</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>suprarhinal cortex</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>entorhinal cortex</BrainRegion>, was studied in the rat using biochemical assay and fluorescence histochemistry. The assay studies demonstrate a moderate norepinephrine (NE) content in the <BrainRegion>amygdala</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>entorhinal cortex</BrainRegion> with a lower value for the <BrainRegion>suprarhinal cortex</BrainRegion>. Following destruction of the <BrainRegion>locus coeruleus</BrainRegion>, the decrease in norepinephrine(NE) content of these <BrainRegion>basal forebrain</BrainRegion> structures indicates that their principal norepinephrine(NE) innervation is from <BrainRegion>locus coeruleus</BrainRegion>. An additional small norepinephrine(NE) input arises from the <BrainRegion>medullary</BrainRegion> norepinephrine(NE) neuron groups. Ablation of dopamine (DA) cell groups (<BrainRegion>substantia nigra-ventral tegmental area</BrainRegion>, SN-VTA) indicates that the dopamine(DA) input to the <BrainRegion>amygdala</BrainRegion> arises from the <BrainRegion>lateral VTA</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>medial half of the SN</BrainRegion>. Fluorescence histochemical studies using the glyoxylic acid-Vibratome technique demonstrate the presence of four distinct types of catecholamine(CA) neuron terminal plexus in the <BrainRegion>posterior basal forebrain</BrainRegion>. These include two different dopamine(DA) fiber types arising in <BrainRegion>SN-VTA</BrainRegion>, small norepinephrine(NE) fibers with small varicosities arising in <BrainRegion>locus coeruleus</BrainRegion> and norepinephrine(NE) fibers with larger varicosities arising in other <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion> norepinephrine(NE) cell groups. The large norepinephrine(NE) fibers appear to enter the <BrainRegion>amygdala</BrainRegion> via the <BrainRegion>ansa peduncularis-ventral amygdaloid bundle</BrainRegion> to innervate the <BrainRegion>central and basolateral nucleus</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>anterior amygdaloid area</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>locus coeruleus</BrainRegion> norepinephrine(NE) fibers appear to enter the <BrainRegion>posterior basal forebrain</BrainRegion> via both the <BrainRegion>stria terminalis</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>ansa peduncularis-ventral amygdaloid bundle</BrainRegion> system to form a moderately dense innervation of the <BrainRegion>central and basolateral nuclei of the amygdala</BrainRegion> and a less dense innervation of the other areas. The dopamine(DA) neuron axons are concentrated in the <BrainRegion>central and basal nuclei</BrainRegion> and intercalated cell groups. Other areas receive a more diffuse dopamine(DA) input, with the exception of the moderately dense innervation of the <BrainRegion>suprarhinal cortex</BrainRegion> and dopamine(DA) &quot;islands" in the <BrainRegion>ventral-anterrior entorhinal cortex</BrainRegion>, The dopamine(DA) input to the <BrainRegion>posterior basal forebrain</BrainRegion> is complex and heterogeneous and the axonal morphology differs greatly among the terminal fields within the <BrainRegion>amygdala</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>adjacent cortical areas</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Modular neuropile organization in the Drosophila larval brain facilitates identification and mapping of central neurons.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Elucidating how neuronal networks process information requires identification of critical individual neurons and their connectivity patterns. For this purpose, we used the third-instar Drosophila larval brain and applied reverse-genetic tools, immunolabeling procedures, and 3D digital reconstruction software. Consistent topological definition of neuropile compartments in the larval brain can be obtained through simple fluorescence-immunolabeling methods. The modular neuropiles can be used as a fiducial framework for mapping the projection patterns of individual neurons labeled with green fluorescent protein (GFP). green fluorescent protein(GFP) -labeled neurons often exhibit dendrite-like arbors as well as clustered varicose terminals on neurite branches that innervate identifiable neuropile compartments. We identified candidate cholinergic interneurons in genetic mosaic brains that overlap with the larval <BrainRegion>optic nerve</BrainRegion> terminus. By using the neuropile framework, we demonstrate that the candidate visual interneurons are not a subset of the previously identified circadian pacemaker neurons that also contact the larval <BrainRegion>optic nerve</BrainRegion> terminus; they may represent parallel pathways in the processing of visual inputs. Thus, in the Drosophila larval brain, modular neuropiles can be used as a framework for systematically identifying, mapping, and classifying interneurons; understanding their roles in behavior can then be pursued further.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>The organization of the <BrainRegion>lateral posterior nucleus</BrainRegion> of the golden hamster after neonatal <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion> lesions.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The reorganization of the adult hamster&apos;s <BrainRegion>lateral posterior nucleus</BrainRegion> after neonatal <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion> lesions was studied using primarily light and electron microscopic degeneration techniques. Two types of experiments were conducted. First, the distributions of the remaining afferents from the <BrainRegion>contralateral superior colliculus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>cotralateral retina</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral posterior neocortex</BrainRegion> were determined using the Fink-Heimer (&apos;67) technique. Normally the projections from the <BrainRegion>contralateral superior colliculus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> are sparse and restricted to small areas in the <BrainRegion>rostrolateral subdivision</BrainRegion>. After neonatal lesions of the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral colliculus</BrainRegion>, however, these two minor projections greatly increase in density and expand to share a common border. In contrast, the normal projection from the <BrainRegion>posterior neocortex</BrainRegion> is dense throughout the <BrainRegion>rostrolateral subdivision</BrainRegion>. After a neonatal <BrainRegion>colliculus</BrainRegion> lesion, however, this projection is greatly decreased in the region occupied by the optic tract terminals. Second, the ultrastructural organizatin of the <BrainRegion>rostrolateral subdivision</BrainRegion> was studied in adult animals whhich had received neonatal <BrainRegion>colliculus</BrainRegion> lesions. Normally, this region is characterized by synaptic clusters in which numerous medium-sized terminals (M-terminals), almost all from the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral colliculus</BrainRegion>, synapse around the shaft of a large central dendrite. The <BrainRegion>contralateral colliculus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> normally contribute only a few medium-sized terminals(M-terminals) . After a neonatal <BrainRegion>colliculus</BrainRegion> lesion, typical clusters still form, but now the expanded projections from the <BrainRegion>contralateral colliculus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> contribute numerous medium-sized terminals(M-terminals) . The <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion> does not contribute medium-sized terminals(M-terminals) in either normal or experimental animals. These results suggest that the afferents to the <BrainRegion>rostrolateral subdivision</BrainRegion> normally compete for synaptic space. The various factors that might be involved in determining the outcome of such competition are discussed.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Distribution of input synapses from processes exhibiting GABA- or glutamate-like immunoreactivity onto terminals of prosternal filiform afferents in the locust.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The locust prosternum carries a population of long filiform hairs that are very sensitive to air currents. The sensory afferent neurones that innervate the hairs make strong monosynaptic connections with an identified intersegmental interneurone (A4I1) which is known to contact motor neurones that supply muscles controlling wing angle during flight. In order discover how the synapse between the afferents and interneurone A4I1 might be modulated, the afferents were labelled intracellularly by backfilling with horseradish peroxidase to reveal their central terminals which lie in the <BrainRegion>prothoracic ganglion</BrainRegion>. A postembedding immunogold method was used to make a quantitative assessment of the prevalence of immunoreactivity for GABA and glutamate in processes presynaptic to the afferent terminals. In one afferent neurone, where 77 synapses were examined, 40 (52%) of the presynaptic processes were immunoreactive for GABA. When adjacent sections through the same terminal branches were labelled with the two antibodies, it was demonstrated that GABA- and glutamate-like immunoreactivity was present in different populations of presynaptic processes. A series of 110 ultrathin sections was cut through one set of afferent terminal branches and alternate grids were stained with GABA and glutamate antibodies. From these sections, the terminals were reconstructed and the position of 35 input and 21 output synapses mapped. Of the 35 input synapses, 18 (51%) were immunoreactive for GABA, 14 (40%) were immunoreactive for glutamate and 3 (9%) were unlabelled by either antibody. On these terminals, the different classes of input synapses appeared to be intermingled at random with the output synapses made by the afferent, and no pattern governing synapse distribution could be discerned.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Neurons in rat <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion> that synthesize nitric oxide.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>We studied the distribution and light- and electron-microscopic morphology of neurons in the <BrainRegion>hippocampal formation</BrainRegion> containing nitric oxide synthase (NOS), and thus likely to release nitric oxide, a freely diffusible neuromediator implicated in long-term potentiation. Only a small fraction of <BrainRegion>hippocampal</BrainRegion> neurons contained nitric oxide synthase(NOS) or its marker, NADPH diaphorase. Most of the positive neurons were in the pyramidal layer of the <BrainRegion>subiculum</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>stratum radiatum of Ammon&apos;s horn</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus</BrainRegion>. Positive neurons were also conspicuous in the molecular layer of the <BrainRegion>dentate gyrus</BrainRegion> and in the pyramidal layer of <BrainRegion>CA3</BrainRegion>, sparse in the pyramidal layer of <BrainRegion>CA2</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>CA1</BrainRegion>, and almost absent from <BrainRegion>presubiculum</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>parasubiculum</BrainRegion>. Numerous positive fibers were seen, especially in <BrainRegion>stratum radiatum and stratum lacunosum-moleculare of Ammon&apos;s horn</BrainRegion>. Double staining experiments demonstrated that nearly all NADPH diaphorase-positive neurons in the <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion> also contained gamma-aminobutyric acid. On the basis of their morphology, distribution, and inhibitory neurotransmitter content, most nitric oxide synthase(NOS) -positive cells in the <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion> are probably local circuit neurons. These data suggest that nitric oxide in <BrainRegion>CA1</BrainRegion> may function as a paracrine agent, rather than a spatially precise messenger, in long-term potentiation.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Correlation of filiform hair position with sensory afferent morphology and synaptic connections in the second instar cockroach.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>An attempt is made to relate the distribution of filiform hairs on the cercus of the second instar cockroach, Periplaneta americana, to the morphology and patterns of synaptic connectivity of their afferents. We studied the most distal 25 of the 39 filiform hairs which are commonly present. Filiform afferent arborizations were stained by cobalt filling from the cell body in the cercus. Three fundamental arbor types were found, two similar to those of the first instar medial (M) and lateral (L) afferents, and a third, novel type. L-type arbors could be divided into four subtypes. The most obvious correlate of arbor type is the circumferential position of the hair on the cercus. The proximodistal position of the sensillum within each cercal segment is also a determinant of its arbor. By comparison of hair positions and afferent morphologies, we were able to ascribe homologies between the second instar hairs and members of adult longitudinal hair columns. The patterns of monosynaptic connections between afferents and giant interneurons (GIs) 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 were determined by recording synaptic potentials in giant interneurons(GIs) evoked by direct mechanical displacement of individual filiform hairs. Latency from stimulus onset to the rise phase of the first excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) was used as the criterion of monosynapticity. The excitatory postsynaptic potential(EPSP) amplitudes of the two original L and M afferents are halved in the second instar, in the absence of a significant decrease in GI input resistance. The other afferents can be divided into two basic classes: those which input to GI5 (M-type), and those which input to GI3 and GI6 (L-type). The former is correlated with a central or medial position, while the latter is associated with a group of afferents situated laterally on the cercus. In segments 3 and 4, input to giant interneurons(GIs) 1 and 2 also correlates with a medial cercal position, however, in the more proximal segments 5 and 6, afferents at all positions input to these interneurons. The occurrence of afferents of identical morphology and similar connectivity in equivalent positions in different segments suggests that each sensory neuron is determined by its two-dimensional position within a segment. The presence of afferents with the same morphology which display proximodistal differences in synaptic connectivity, and of other afferents which have M-type connectivity despite L-type morphology, means that anatomy is generally a poor predictor of synaptic connectivity.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Rhombomeric</BrainRegion> organization of vestibular pathways in larval frogs.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText><BrainRegion>Rhombencephalic subnuclei</BrainRegion> and projection pathways related to vestibular function were mapped in larval ranid frogs. The retention of <BrainRegion>overt postembryonic rhombomeres</BrainRegion> (r) allowed direct visualization of the locations of neurons retrogradely labeled with fluorescent dextran amines from the midbrain <BrainRegion>oculomotor complex</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>cerebellum</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>vestibular nuclei</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>. <BrainRegion>Oculomotor</BrainRegion> projecting vestibular neurons were mainly located in <BrainRegion>bilateral r1/2</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>ipsilateral r3</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>contralateral r5-8</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>spinal</BrainRegion> projecting vestibular neurons mainly in <BrainRegion>ipsilateral r4</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>contralateral r5</BrainRegion>. <BrainRegion>Vestibular commissural</BrainRegion> neurons were located in <BrainRegion>r1-3</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>r5-7</BrainRegion> and were largely excluded from <BrainRegion>r4</BrainRegion>. <BrainRegion>Cerebellar</BrainRegion> projecting neurons included <BrainRegion>contralateral inferior olivary</BrainRegion> neurons in <BrainRegion>r8</BrainRegion> and vestibular neurons in <BrainRegion>bilateral r6/7</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>contralateral r1/2</BrainRegion>. Mapping these results onto adult anuran vestibular organization indicates that the <BrainRegion>superior vestibular nucleus</BrainRegion> derives from <BrainRegion>larval r1/2</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>lateral vestibular nucleus</BrainRegion> from <BrainRegion>r3/4</BrainRegion>, and the major portions of the <BrainRegion>medial and descending vestibular nuclei</BrainRegion> from <BrainRegion>r5-8</BrainRegion>. The lateral vestibulospinal tract projects from an origin in <BrainRegion>r4</BrainRegion>, whereas a possible ascending tract of Deiters arises in <BrainRegion>r3</BrainRegion>. <BrainRegion>Rhombomere 5</BrainRegion> contains a nuclear group that appears homologous to the <BrainRegion>tangential nucleus</BrainRegion> of fish, reptiles, and birds and thus likely serves gravistatic and linear vestibulomotor reflexes. Comparisons between frogs and other vertebrates suggest that vestibular neurons performing similar computational roles during head movements originate from the same segmental locations in different species.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Growth of a limb <BrainRegion>spinal nerve</BrainRegion>: an ultrastructural study.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>A quantitative study of the delivery of nerve fibres to the developing limb has been made. Electron microscope (EM) sections of <BrainRegion>SN 9</BrainRegion> in Xenopus were taken at close intervals between <BrainRegion>dorsal root ganglion</BrainRegion> and limb-bud. Numbers and types of axons in each section were counted. Counts declined steadily with distance from the ganglion towards the base of the limb. This is large due to some axons not having grown the full distance at the time of fixation. The slope corresponded with an outgrowth velocity of 0.5 mm a day, without branching. Distally, at stages 50 and 51, but not at stages 49 and 54, the decline was reversed, and a peak of axon number was found. This is strong evidence for axon branching in this region. Since this took place at least one stage before <BrainRegion>SN 9</BrainRegion> bifurcated, and since the bifurcation was distal to the branching when it did appear, it is suggested that axon branching at a nerve bifurcation might be part of a trial-and-error mechanism for pathway selection. Observations were made on the sheath surrounding the nerve, and on its assembly. Initially, axons grow out naked and not parallel; Schwann cells migrate after the growing front. Processes of these cells collect individual axons, and transfer them inwards to form the primitive parallel fibre bundle, enclosed by a family of Schwann cells. Myelination later occurs in a similar manner: Schwann-cell processes extend into a bundle of naked axons and eventually encircle a single transitional axon, with one Schwann cell eventually containing many such axons. Finally comes the stage of promyelin, in which a single Schwann cell encircles a single axon. Myelin whorls are then formed from this complex.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Organization of <BrainRegion>sensory and motor nuclei of the trigeminal nerve</BrainRegion> in lampreys.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Anterograde and retrograde HRP transport were used to elucidate the primary central projections of the <BrainRegion>trigeminal nerve</BrainRegion> in a lamprey, Lampetra japonica, by application to the <BrainRegion>ophthalmic, apical, basilar, suborbital, and mandibular branches of the trigeminal nerve</BrainRegion>. (1) Most of the <BrainRegion>trigeminal</BrainRegion> and a few facial ganglion cells were labeled. The ganglion cells of each nerve were distributed in separate areas within their respective ganglia. (2) Some <BrainRegion>ipsilateral medullary</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>spinal</BrainRegion> dorsal cells were labeled after HRP application to the <BrainRegion>ophthalmic and apical nerves</BrainRegion>, but there was no contralateral labeling. (3) Most of the neurons of the <BrainRegion>trigeminal motor nucleus</BrainRegion> were labeled, and when the <BrainRegion>apical or the basilar nerve</BrainRegion> was labeled, in each case a cluster of small motor neurons was found ventrolateral to the classic <BrainRegion>motor nucleus</BrainRegion>. (4) Miscellaneous neurons were found scattered along the course of the descending <BrainRegion>trigeminal tract and nucleus</BrainRegion> in all cases except after application to the <BrainRegion>mandibular branch</BrainRegion>. The shape, size, and distribution patterns of these neurons were varied, and several characteristics indicated that they were sensory in nature. (5) In the <BrainRegion>rostral part of the medulla</BrainRegion>, sensory fibers of each nerve showed restricted localization within the descending <BrainRegion>trigeminal tract and nucleus</BrainRegion>. When compared to the distribution of the same fibers in the hagfish Eptatretus burgeri, another member of the cyclostomes, the distribution pattern in the lampreys studied was closer to the type seen in gnathostomes.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Organization of <BrainRegion>cerebral cortical</BrainRegion> afferent systems in the rat. II. <BrainRegion>Magnocellular basal nucleus</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The organization of the <BrainRegion>magnocellular basal nucleus</BrainRegion> (MBN) projection to <BrainRegion>cerebral cortex</BrainRegion> in the rat has been studied by using cytoarchitectonic, immunohistochemical, and retrograde and anterograde transport methods. The distribution of retrogradely labeled <BrainRegion>basal forebrain</BrainRegion> neurons after <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> injections of wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate was essentially identical to that of neurons staining immunohistochemically for choline acetyltransferase. These large (20-30 micrometers perikaryon diameter) multipolar neurons were found scattered through a number of <BrainRegion>basal forebrain</BrainRegion> cell groups: <BrainRegion>medial septal nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>nucleus of the diagonal band of Broca</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>magnocellular preoptic nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>substantia innominata</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>globus pallidus</BrainRegion>. This peculiar distribution mimics the locations of pathways by which descending <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> fibers enter the <BrainRegion>diencephalon</BrainRegion>. Each <BrainRegion>cortical area</BrainRegion> was innervated by a characteristic subset of <BrainRegion>magnocellular basal nucleus</BrainRegion>(MBN) neurons, always located in close association with descending cortical fibers. In many instances anterogradely labeled descending <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> fibers appeared to ramify into diffuse terminal fields among <BrainRegion>magnocellular basal nucleus</BrainRegion>(MBN) neurons which were retrogradely labeled by the same <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> injection. Double label experiments using retrograde transport of fluorescent dyes confirmed that <BrainRegion>magnocellular basal nucleus</BrainRegion>(MBN) neurons innervate restricted <BrainRegion>cortical fields</BrainRegion>. Anterograde autoradiographic transport studies after injections of 3H-amino acids into <BrainRegion>magnocellular basal nucleus</BrainRegion>(MBN) revealed that <BrainRegion>magnocellular basal nucleus</BrainRegion>(MBN) axons reach <BrainRegion>cerebral cortex</BrainRegion> primarily via two pathways: (1) The medial pathway, arising from the <BrainRegion>medial septal nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>nucleus of the diagonal band</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>medial substantia innominata</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>globus pallidus magnocellular basal nucleus</BrainRegion>(MBN) neurons, curves dorsally rostral to the <BrainRegion>diagonal band nucleus</BrainRegion>, up to the <BrainRegion>genu of the corpus callosum</BrainRegion>. Most of the fibers either directly enter <BrainRegion>medial frontal cortex</BrainRegion> or turn back over the <BrainRegion>genu of the corpus callosum</BrainRegion> into the <BrainRegion>superficial medial cingulate bundle</BrainRegion>. Many of these fibers enter <BrainRegion>anterior cigulate</BrainRegion> or <BrainRegion>retrosplenial cortex</BrainRegion>, but some can be traced back to the <BrainRegion>splenium of the corpus callosum</BrainRegion>, where a few enter <BrainRegion>visual cortex</BrainRegion> but most turn ventrally and sweep into the <BrainRegion>hippocampal formation</BrainRegion>. Here they are joined by other fibers which, at the <BrainRegion>genu of the corpus callosum</BrainRegion>, remain ventrally located and run caudally through the <BrainRegion>dorsal fornix</BrainRegion> into the <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion>. (2) The lateral pathway arises in part from <BrainRegion>medial septal</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>diagonal band</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>magnocellular preoptic neurons</BrainRegion> whose axons sweep laterally through the <BrainRegion>substantia innominata</BrainRegion> to innervate primarily <BrainRegion>piriform</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>perirhinal</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>endorhinal cortex</BrainRegion>. Some of these fibers may also enter the <BrainRegion>hippocampal formation</BrainRegion> from the <BrainRegion>entorhinal cortex</BrainRegion> via the <BrainRegion>ventral subiculum</BrainRegion>.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Distribution of choline acetyltransferase immunoreactivity in the brain of the lizard Gallotia galloti.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The aim of the present study is to provide a complete description of the distribution of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) immunoreactivity (i) in the brain of the lizard Gallotia galloti, on the basis of two different primary antisera: rat anti- choline acetyltransferase(ChAT) and rabbit anti-chicken choline acetyltransferase(ChAT) . Considering that the brain is a segmented structure, we have analysed our data with respect to transverse segmental domains (or <BrainRegion>neuromeres</BrainRegion>), which have been previously described by several authors in the brain of vertebrates. In the <BrainRegion>telencephalon</BrainRegion>, choline acetyltransferase(ChAT) i neurons are seen in the <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>anterior dorsal ventricular ridge</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>basal ganglia</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>diagonal band</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>bed nucleus of the stria terminalis</BrainRegion>. Further caudally, choline acetyltransferase(ChAT) i cell bodies are located in the <BrainRegion>preoptic area</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>habenula</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>isthmus</BrainRegion>, and all motor efferent centers of the <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>. Plexuses of choline acetyltransferase(ChAT) i fibers are observed in the areas containing cholinergic cell bodies. In addition, distinct plexuses are found in the <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>posterior dorsal ventricular ridge</BrainRegion>, the neuropiles of all primary visual centers of the <BrainRegion>diencephalon</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>mesencephalon</BrainRegion>, and several non-visual nuclei of the <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion>. The distribution of choline acetyltransferase(ChAT) immunoreactivity in the brain of G. galloti resembles in many respects that of other vertebrates, and differences are mainly observed in the <BrainRegion>pretectum</BrainRegion> and midbrain <BrainRegion>tectum</BrainRegion>. Transverse segmental domains were identified in the <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>forebrain</BrainRegion> of Gallotia when the <BrainRegion>cranial nerve</BrainRegion> roots and fiber tracts were used as a reference, and most <BrainRegion>cranial motor nuclei</BrainRegion> were found to occupy the same segmental positions as have been reported in the chick.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Role of target tissue in regulating the development of <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> ganglion cells in the albino rat: effects of kainate lesions in the <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Kainic acid or ibotenic acid was injected unilaterally into the major target regions of the axons of <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> ganglion cells--the <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion> (SC) or <BrainRegion>dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion> (DLG)--of rat pups ranging in age from postnatal day 0 to postnatal day 10 (P0 - P10). While the <BrainRegion>collicular</BrainRegion> or <BrainRegion>geniculate</BrainRegion> neurons within the injection site died within 48 hours of the injection, damage to axons and terminals of extrinsic origin within the injected region was not apparent. The neuronal degeneration induced by the neurotoxins, observed at both the light and electron microscopic levels, resembled the neuronal degeneration that occurs in the <BrainRegion>colliculus</BrainRegion> during normal development. Macrophages were identified in the regions containing degenerating cells. Two to three weeks after the injections of neurotoxin, massive injections of the enzyme, horseradish peroxidase (HRP), were made into the <BrainRegion>retinorecipient nuclei</BrainRegion>. After about 24-hour survival time the numbers of <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> ganglion cells were estimated by counting the number of neurons containing horseradish peroxidase(HRP) reaction products in sample areas distributed in a regular rectangular array across the entire <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> surface. In the animals in which the neurotoxin was injected into the <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion>(SC) during the first 4 postnatal days, there was a substantial reduction (on average 41.5%; the range: 27.5-65.5%) in the normal number (mean value of 113,000--Potts et al.: Dev. Brain Res. 3:481-486, &apos;82) of <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> ganglion cells surviving the period of &quot;naturally occurring ganglion cell death" in the <BrainRegion>retinae</BrainRegion> contralateral to the injected <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion>(SC) . By contrast, injections of neurotoxins into the <BrainRegion>dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(DLG) and/or the optic tract of newborn rats did not result in a significant reduction in the numbers of <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> ganglion cells surviving the period of naturally occurring ganglion cell death. The period of sensitivity of <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> ganglion cells to the injection of neurotoxin into the <BrainRegion>colliculi</BrainRegion> extends from birth to about the end of the first postnatal week; the greatest sensitivity seems to be restricted to the first 3-4 postnatal days. In the <BrainRegion>retinae</BrainRegion> in which the total number (and density) of ganglion cells was substantially reduced by the selective destruction of their target cells, the centro-peripheral difference in the somal diameters of the ganglion cells (apparent in normal animals) was abolished, both amongst the whole population of ganglion cells and amongst the ganglion cells with the largest somata, relatively thick axons, and large-gauge primary dendrites (Class I cells). The number and distribution of the Class I cells in the depleted <BrainRegion>retinae</BrainRegion> were, however, unaltered.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Synaptology of trigemino- and spinothalamic lamina I terminations in the <BrainRegion>posterior ventral medial nucleus</BrainRegion> of the macaque.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>We used the electron microscope to examine lamina I trigemino- and spinothalamic (TSTT) terminations in the <BrainRegion>posterior part of the ventral medial nucleus</BrainRegion> (VMpo) of the macaque <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion>. Lamina I terminations were identified by anterograde labeling with biotinylated dextran, and 109 boutons on 38 terminal fibers were closely studied in series of ultrathin sections. Five unlabeled terminal boutons of similar appearance were also examined in detail. Three-dimensional, volume-rendered computer models were reconstructed from complete series of serial sections for 29 boutons on 10 labeled terminal fibers and one unlabeled terminal fiber. In addition, postembedding immunogold staining for GABA was obtained in alternate sections through 23 boutons. Lamina I <BrainRegion>TSTT</BrainRegion> terminations in <BrainRegion>VMpo</BrainRegion> generally have several large boutons (mean length = 2.16 microm, mean width = 1.29 microm) that are densely packed with vesicles and make asymmetric synaptic contacts on low-order dendrites of <BrainRegion>VMpo</BrainRegion> neurons (mean diameter 1.45 microm). They are closely associated with GABAergic presynaptic dendrites (PSDs), and nearly all form classic triadic arrangements (28 of 29 reconstructed boutons). Consecutive boutons on individual terminal fibers make multiple contacts with a single postsynaptic dendrite and can show evidence of progressive complexity. Dendritic appendages that enwrap and invaginate the terminal bouton constitute additional anatomic evidence for secure, high-fidelity synaptic transfer. These observations provide direct ultrastructural evidence supporting the hypothesis that <BrainRegion>VMpo</BrainRegion> is a lamina I <BrainRegion>TSTT</BrainRegion> <BrainRegion>thalamocortical relay nucleus</BrainRegion> in primates that subserves pain, temperature, itch, and other sensations related to the physiological condition of the body.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Peripheral organization and central projections of the <BrainRegion>electrosensory nerves</BrainRegion> in gymnotiform fish.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The electrosensory system of weakly electric gymnotiform fish is described from the receptor distribution on the body surface to the termination of the primary afferents in the <BrainRegion>posterior lateral line lobe</BrainRegion> (PLLL). There are two types of electroreceptor(ampullary and tuberous) and a single type of lateral line mechanoreceptor (neuromast). Receptor counts in Apteronotus albifrons show that (1) neuromasts are distributed as in other teleosts; (2) ampullary receptors number 151 on one side of the head and 208 on one side of the body; (3) tuberous receptors were estimated to number 3,000-3,500 on one side of the head and 3,500-5,000 on one side of the body. The distribution of each receptor type is described. Each receptor is innervated by a single primary afferent. Electrosensory afferents have myelinated cell bodies in the ganglion of the <BrainRegion>anterior lateral line nerve</BrainRegion> (ALLN). The distribution of these ganglion cell diameters is strongly bimodal in Apteronotus and Eigenmannia: The smaller-diameter cells may be those which innervate ampullary electroreceptors, the larger-diameter tuberous electroreceptors. Transganglionic HRP transport techniques were used to determine the first-order connections of the <BrainRegion>anterior lateral line nerve</BrainRegion> in six species of gymnotiform fish. Small branches of the <BrainRegion>anterior lateral line nerve</BrainRegion>(ALLN) were labeled so as to determine the somatotopic organization in the <BrainRegion>posterior lateral line lobe</BrainRegion>(PLLL) . The <BrainRegion>posterior lateral line lobe</BrainRegion>(PLLL) is divided into four segments from <BrainRegion>medial to lateral, termed medial, centromedial, centrolateral, and lateral segments</BrainRegion> (Heiligenberg and Dye, &apos;81). Representations of the head are found rostrally in each zone, and the trunk is mapped caudally in each zone. Thus there are four body maps in the <BrainRegion>posterior lateral line lobe</BrainRegion>(PLLL) . The <BrainRegion>medial segment</BrainRegion> receives <BrainRegion>ampullary</BrainRegion> input (Heiligenberg and Dye, &apos;82) and maps the dorsoventral body axis mediolaterally, as does the <BrainRegion>tuberous centrolateral segment</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>tuberous centromedial and lateral segments</BrainRegion> map the dorsoventral axis lateromedially. Thus the <BrainRegion>medial and centromedial segments</BrainRegion> meet belly to belly, the <BrainRegion>centromedial and centrolateral segments</BrainRegion> meet back to back, and the <BrainRegion>centrolateral and lateral segments</BrainRegion> meet belly to belly. Adjacent electrosensory maps within the <BrainRegion>posterior lateral line lobe</BrainRegion>(PLLL) are therefore always mirror images.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Amygdalo-cortical sprouting continues into early adulthood: implications for the development of normal and abnormal function during adolescence.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Adolescence is a critical stage for the development of emotional maturity and diverse forms of psychopathology. The <BrainRegion>posterior basolateral nucleus of the amygdala</BrainRegion> is known to mediate fear and anxiety and is important in assigning emotional valence to cognitive processes. The <BrainRegion>medial prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion>, a homologue of the human <BrainRegion>anterior cingulate cortex</BrainRegion>, mediates emotional, attentional, and motivational behaviors at the <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> level. We postulate that the development of connectivity between these two corticolimbic regions contributes to an enhanced integration of emotion and cognition during the postnatal period. In order to characterize the development of this relay, injections of the anterograde tracer biocytin were stereotaxically placed within the <BrainRegion>posterior basolateral nucleus of the amygdala</BrainRegion> of rats at successive postnatal time points (postnatal days 6-120). Labeled fibers in the <BrainRegion>medial prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion> were evaluated using a combination of brightfield, confocal, and electron microscopy. We found that the density of labeled fibers originating from the <BrainRegion>posterior basolateral nucleus</BrainRegion> shows a sharp curvilinear increase within layers II and V of the <BrainRegion>anterior cingulate cortex</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>infralimbic subdivisions of medial prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion> during the late postweanling period. This increase was paralleled by a linear rise in the number of axospinous and axodendritic synapses present in the neuropil. Based on these results, we propose that late maturation of amygdalo-cortical connectivity may provide an anatomical basis for the development and integration of normal and possibly abnormal emotional behavior during adolescence and early adulthood.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Functional degeneration of isolated central stumps of crayfish sensory axons.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>In the crayfish, Procambarus clarkii, <BrainRegion>nerve 5</BrainRegion> carries primarily sensory axons from the tail fan to the <BrainRegion>6th abdominal ganglion</BrainRegion> where they synaptically activate interneuron A. Since the sensory neurons have their somata located at the <BrainRegion>periphery, transection of nerve 5</BrainRegion> part way to the ganglion allowed us to examine the fate of their soma-less central stumps. Up to 3 weeks postlesion the response to stimulation of <BrainRegion>nerve 5</BrainRegion> consisted of a brief latency spike in interneuron A, similar to that in control animals and to stimulation of the intact <BrainRegion>nerve 4</BrainRegion>. Stimulation of the lesioned <BrainRegion>nerve 5</BrainRegion> beyond 3 weeks failed to fire interneuron A. This loss of function was correlated to loss of axons in <BrainRegion>nerve 5</BrainRegion> deduced by comparing the numbers in the lesioned <BrainRegion>nerve 5</BrainRegion> to its contralateral intact counterpart. The numbers are about equal in the paired nerves but rapidly decline on the lesioned side to 50% within 1 week, 20% within 3 weeks, and less than 10% in subsequent weeks. This loss affects all size classes of axons. However, in the 3 week lesioned nerve large glial infoldings subdivided some of the larger axons and single nuclei were seen in a few of the medium-sized axons. Possibly subdivision of large axons by glial infolding may introduce glial nuclei into axons.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>A vasopressin and oxytocin containing nucleus in the pig <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion> that shows neuronal changes during puberty.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>A vasopressin and oxytocin containing nucleus is described for the first time in the pig <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion>. It is located near the <BrainRegion>third ventricle</BrainRegion>, just dorsal to the <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion>, and consists of magnocellular neurons, similar to those of the <BrainRegion>supraoptic nucleus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>paraventricular nucleus</BrainRegion>. Morphometric analysis of neuronal number, size, density, and volume was performed at four different ages: 1 day, 7 weeks, 16 weeks, and 30 weeks postnatally. No sex difference in these parameters was observed. In this period the volume of the nucleus increased gradually from 6.6 x 10(-3) to 54.2 x 10(-3) mm3. One day after birth 1,215 +/- 191 (mean +/- SEM) neurons were present in the vasopressin and oxytocin containing nucleus, followed by a decrease to 771 +/- 80 neurons at 7 weeks and 697 +/- 116 at 16 weeks. Between 16 and 30 weeks (puberty) there was a dramatic increase in neuron number up to 1,765 +/- 214 neurons. This increase in the number of vasopressin and oxytocin containing neurons in the pig <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion> is much later in development than has ever been reported so far.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Nitric oxide synthase activity reveals an asymmetrical organization of the frog habenulae during development: A histochemical and cytoarchitectonic study from tadpoles to the mature Rana esculenta, with notes on the <BrainRegion>pineal complex</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>In the adult frog, structural asymmetry of the <BrainRegion>left dorsal habenula</BrainRegion> in respect to the right counterpart has been repeatedly documented in previous studies. In the present investigation, histochemical expression of beta-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-diaphorase activity was examined in the <BrainRegion>habenulae</BrainRegion> of the developing and adult Rana esculenta. In tadpoles and during metamorphosis, selective neuropil staining was consistently found within a lateral compartment of the <BrainRegion>medial subnucleus of the left dorsal habenula</BrainRegion>. The staining was still present in the same location, but much less intense, in the mature frog, indicating that the neurochemical pattern observed during development was at least in part transient. Thus, the present data point out a peculiar neurochemical pattern of the <BrainRegion>habenular</BrainRegion> asymmetry in the frog, suggesting that nitric oxide may be involved in the developmental shaping which leads to an asymmetrical configuration of the <BrainRegion>habenulae</BrainRegion>. In addition, beta-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate(NADPH) -diaphorase-positive cells were detected in the <BrainRegion>frontal organ</BrainRegion> (the <BrainRegion>extracranial component of the pineal complex</BrainRegion> in strict relationship with the <BrainRegion>habenulae</BrainRegion> in the frog), and labeled fibers were found in the <BrainRegion>frontal nerve</BrainRegion>, which arises from the <BrainRegion>frontal organ</BrainRegion>. This latter finding supports the postulated relationship of the <BrainRegion>habenular</BrainRegion> asymmetry with the occurrence of the <BrainRegion>frontal organ</BrainRegion>. The finding of beta-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate(NADPH) -diaphorase histochemical reactivity confined to a distinct portion of the <BrainRegion>medial subnucleus of the left dorsal habenula</BrainRegion> prompted a reexamination of the cytoarchitecture of the developing and mature <BrainRegion>habenular complex</BrainRegion> in the frog. The bicompartmentalization detected with histochemistry in the <BrainRegion>medial subnucleus of the left dorsal habenula</BrainRegion> of the developing and adult frog was fully supported by the study of Nissl-stained epithalamic sections. These data point out that the left-right structural differences of the frog <BrainRegion>habenular complex</BrainRegion> are more complex than previously believed, and may be subserved by chemically regulated developmental processes.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Quantitative synaptology of feline motoneurones to external anal sphincter muscle.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Motoneurones innervating the cat external anal sphincter muscle were labelled retrogradely following intramuscular injections with horseradish peroxidase (HRP). Labelled motoneurones were examined by correlative light and electron microscopy (LM and EM) with special regard to a qualitative and morphometric analysis of the axon terminals resident on the neuronal membrane. By LM, labelled motoneurones were (1) ipsilateral to the injections; (2) all in S1-S2; (3) found only in the superior dorsomedial region of Onuf&apos;s nucleus; and (4) exhibited a broad spectrum of diameters (25-72 micron, mean 47.4 +/- 11.3 micron). By EM, axon terminals on the neuronal membrane when classified according to size, vesicle shape, and synaptic complex ultrastructure conformed to the S-, F-, T-, M-, and C-type terminals previously described for cat lumbosacral motoneurones. C-terminals confirmed these sphincteric motoneurones to be skeletomotor. Pooled data from midnuclear sections through 15 random labelled motoneurones (20-64-micron diameter) revealed that S- and F-type terminals predominated, with numerically few M and C types. Notwithstanding their low frequency (0.3/100 micron membrane) C-terminals contributed 1% of the mean areal coverage by terminals, which implies a potentially larger synaptic influence relative to other terminal types. Linear relationships occurred between terminal frequency (or cover) and motoneurone diameter. While motoneurones greater than 40 micron in diameter exhibited all five terminal types, labelled motoneurones less than or equal to 30 micron generally possessed only S-, F-, and occasional T-type terminals, and in this respect resembled gamma motoneurones.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Regulation of KCC2 and NKCC during development: membrane insertion and differences between cell types.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The developmental switch of GABA&apos;s action from excitation to inhibition is likely due to a change in intracellular chloride concentration from high to low. Here we determined if the GABA switch correlates with the developmental expression patterns of KCC2, the chloride extruder K+-Cl- cotransporter, and NKCC, the chloride accumulator Na+-K+-Cl- cotransporter. Immunoblots of ferret <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> showed that KCC2 upregulated in an exponential manner similar to synaptophysin (a synaptic marker). In contrast, NKCC, which was initially expressed at a constant level, upregulated quickly between P14 and P28, and finally downregulated to an adult level that was greater than the initial phase. At the cellular level, immunocytochemistry showed that in the inner plexiform layer KCC2&apos;s density increased gradually and its localization within ganglion cells shifted from being primarily in the cytosol (between P1-13) to being in the plasma membrane (after P21). In the outer plexiform layer, KCC2 was detected as soon as this layer started to form and increased gradually. Interestingly, however, KCC2 was initially restricted to photoreceptor terminals, while in the adult it was restricted to bipolar dendrites. Thus, the overall KCC2 expression level in ferret <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> increases with age, but the time course differs between cell types. In ganglion cells the upregulation of KCC2 by itself cannot explain the relatively fast switch in GABA&apos;s action; additional events, possibly KCC2's integration into the plasma membrane and downregulation of NKCC, might also contribute. In photoreceptors the transient expression of KCC2 suggests a role for this transporter in development.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Conduction and synaptic transmission in the <BrainRegion>optic nerve</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion> during development of the retinocollicular projection in the wallaby (Macropus eugenii).</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>When do the developing connections between mammalian <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> ganglion cells and the <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion> become functional? Evoked potentials elicited by <BrainRegion>optic nerve</BrainRegion> stimulation in the pouch young of the wallaby were used to answer the question. Up to 42 days after birth, the evoked potentials in the <BrainRegion>colliculus</BrainRegion> appeared to be generated by axon conduction. Synaptic activity was first recorded from the <BrainRegion>rostral colliculus</BrainRegion> at 45 days, and was found to be progressively more caudal, spreading to cover the <BrainRegion>colliculus</BrainRegion>, by 65 days. From the earliest indication of synaptic activity until eye opening at 140 days, current source density (CSD) analysis consistently showed the same basic pattern: an initial deep sink from synaptic activity of fast (Y type) fibres, and a more superficial longer-latency sink from slower (W type) fibres. All features became more clearly delineated with age. The indirect retinocorticocollicular connection appeared between 134 days and 146 days. The ability of <BrainRegion>optic nerve</BrainRegion> fibres to sustain action potentials precedes their formation of functional synapses with <BrainRegion>collicular</BrainRegion> neurons, which happens abruptly at three months before eye opening. current source density(CSD) analysis showed that the relationship between the conduction velocity of <BrainRegion>optic nerve</BrainRegion> fibres and their depth of termination is evident from the first signs of synapse formation.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Localization of the three GnRH types and GnRH receptors in the brain of a cichlid fish: Insights into their neuroendocrine and neuromodulator functions.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The cognate receptor for any of the known gonadotropin-releasing hormones (GnRHs) has not been directly demonstrated. In order to establish this and shed light on the functions of GnRH types, we analyzed the neuroanatomical location and time of initial expression of three distinct GnRH receptors (GnRH-Rs) and the three endogenous gonadotropin-releasing hormones(GnRHs) in the brain of developing and sexually mature tilapia Oreochromis niloticus using immunocytochemistry. In all age groups, including males and females, GnRH-RIA was seen specifically in gonadotropes (Parhar et al. [2002] J Neuroendocrinol 14:657-665) but was undetectable in the brain. On day 8 after fertilization, GnRH-RIB was first seen in the <BrainRegion>periventricular hypothalamus</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>lateral recess nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>posterior recess nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>posterior tuberal nucleus</BrainRegion>) and GnRH-RIII in the <BrainRegion>olfactory epithelium</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>telencephalon</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>preoptic region</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>mediobasal hypothalamus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>mesencephalon</BrainRegion>, and in the <BrainRegion>hindbrain</BrainRegion>. Double-label immunocytochemistry showed GnRH1 (Ser(8) GnRH)-immunoreactive neuronal processes projecting mainly to the <BrainRegion>proximal pars distalis of the pituitary</BrainRegion>, while GnRH2 (His(5), Trp(7), Tyr(8) GnRH) and GnRH3 (Trp(7), Leu(8) GnRH) fibers were observed in close association with cells containing GnRH-RIB and GnRH-RIII in the brain. These results suggest that GnRH-RIA might be hypophysiotropic in nature, whereas GnRH-RIB and GnRH-RIII could have additional neuromodulatory functions. Further, evidence of close proximity of GnRH-R-containing cells and neuronal processes of multiple GnRH types suggests complex cross-talk between several GnRH ligands and GnRH receptors(GnRH-Rs) .</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Anatomical comparison of the macaque and marsupial <BrainRegion>visual cortex</BrainRegion>: common features that may reflect retention of essential <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> elements.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>This study identifies fundamental anatomical features of <BrainRegion>primary visual cortex</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>area V1</BrainRegion> of macaque monkey <BrainRegion>cerebral cortex</BrainRegion>, i.e., features that are present in <BrainRegion>area V1</BrainRegion> of phylogenetically distant mammals of quite different lifestyle and features that are common to other regions of <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion>. We compared anatomical constituents of macaque V1 with V1 of members of the two principal marsupial lines, the dunnart and the quokka, that diverged from the eutherian mammalian line over 135 million years ago. Features of <BrainRegion>V1</BrainRegion> common to both macaque and marsupials were then compared with anatomical features we have previously described for macaque <BrainRegion>prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion>. Despite large differences in overall area and thickness of <BrainRegion>V1 cortex</BrainRegion> between these animals, the absolute size of pyramidal neurons is remarkably similar, as are their specific dendritic branch patterns and patterns of distribution of intrinsic axons. Pyramidal neuron patchy connections exist in the <BrainRegion>supragranular V1</BrainRegion> in both the marsupial quokka and macaque as well as in macaque <BrainRegion>prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion>. Several specific types of aspinous interneurons are common to <BrainRegion>area V1</BrainRegion> in both marsupial and macaque and are also present in macaque <BrainRegion>prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion>. Spiny stellate cells are a common feature of the <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion>-recipient, mid-depth lamina 4 of <BrainRegion>V1</BrainRegion> in all three species. Because these similarities exist despite the very different lifestyles and evolutionary histories of the animals compared, this finding argues for a highly conserved framework of cellular detail in macaque <BrainRegion>primary visual cortex</BrainRegion> rather than convergent evolution of these features.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Crossed and uncrossed <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> projections to the hamster circadian system.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The hamster <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion> (SCN), site of the circadian clock, has been thought to be equally and completely innervated by each <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>. This issue was studied in animals that had received an injection of the tracer cholera toxin subunit B (CTb) conjugated to Alexa 488 into the vitreous of one eye, with cholera toxin subunit B(CTb) -Alexa 594 injected into the other. <BrainRegion>Retinal</BrainRegion> projections to the <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion>(SCN) and other nuclei of the circadian system were simultaneously evaluated by using confocal laser microscopy. Each <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> provides completely overlapping terminal fields throughout each <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion>(SCN) . Although <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion>(SCN) innervation by the <BrainRegion>contralateral retina</BrainRegion> is slightly denser than that from the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral retina</BrainRegion>, there are distinct <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion>(SCN) regions where input from one side is predominant, but not exclusive. A dense terminal field from the <BrainRegion>contralateral retina</BrainRegion> encompasses, and extends dorsally beyond, the <BrainRegion>central suprachiasmatic nucleus(SCN) subnucleus</BrainRegion> identified by calbindin-immunoreactive neurons. Surrounding the dense terminal field, innervation is largely derived from the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral retina</BrainRegion>. The densest terminal field in the <BrainRegion>intergeniculate leaflet</BrainRegion> is from the <BrainRegion>contralateral retina</BrainRegion>, which completely overlaps the ipsilateral projection. Most nuclei of the <BrainRegion>pretectum</BrainRegion> receive innervation largely, but not solely, from the <BrainRegion>contralateral retina</BrainRegion>, although the <BrainRegion>olivary pretectal nucleus</BrainRegion> has very dense patches of innervation derived <BrainRegion>exclusively from one retina</BrainRegion> or the other. Retina-dependent variation in terminal field density within the three closely examined nuclei may indicate areas of specialized function not previously appreciated. This issue is discussed in the context of the melanopsin-containing <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> ganglion cell projections to several nuclei in the circadian visual system.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Changes in synaptic density after developmental compression or expansion of <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> input to the <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> projection to the <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion> can be made abnormally dense by inducing a &quot;compressed" <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> projection into a subnormal <BrainRegion>tectal</BrainRegion> volume, or abnormally sparse by monocular enucleation early in development. Any or all of the features of cell number, axonal arbor, dendritic arbor, and synaptic density could potentially be adjusted to compensate for such variations in the convergence of one cell population on another. We have examined the consequences of neonatal partial <BrainRegion>tectal</BrainRegion> ablation or monocular enucleation for synaptic length, density, and relative numbers of synapse classes in the <BrainRegion>superficial gray layer</BrainRegion> of the hamster <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion>. Monocular enucleation resulted in a reduction of synaptic density in the superficial gray layer of the colliculus ipsilateral to the remaining eye. This decrease in density was entirely accounted for by a reduction of the number of synapses with round vesicles, large asymmetric terminal specializations, and pale mitochondria characteristic of retinocollicular terminals (RLP synapses). There was no compensatory increase in any other synaptic class. RLP synapses were larger in monocular enucleates. Partial <BrainRegion>tectal</BrainRegion> ablation had no effect on synaptic density, nor on the relative proportions of different synaptic types. Synapses of the RLP class were slightly smaller than normal. These results suggest that synaptic density is normally at a maximum that cannot be altered by increases in potential input. However, density may be reduced by decreasing the number of inputs. Terminal classes do not appear to compete with each other within the collicular volume, suggesting that postsynaptic cells controls both the classes and numbers of their potential inputs.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Serotoninergic system in the <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion> of the marmoset: a combined immunocytochemical and three-dimensional reconstruction study.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The distribution and morphology of serotoninergic neurons in the marmoset (New-World monkey) <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion> were studied by immunocytochemistry and computer-assisted three-dimensional reconstruction. The cytoarchitectonic localization of serotoninergic neurons was ascertained in series of adjacent immunostained and Nissl-stained sections, and the extent and shape of the <BrainRegion>serotoninergic nuclei</BrainRegion> were visualized by computer reconstruction. The overall distribution of the immunoreactive neurons is comparable to that already described for several species of primates. The <BrainRegion>serotoninergic nuclei</BrainRegion> are spatially well segregated into an anterior and a posterior group. The anterior group, in the <BrainRegion>mesencephalon</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>rostral pons</BrainRegion>, contains the largest population of <BrainRegion>serotoninergic neurons</BrainRegion>. These neurons are not confined to the <BrainRegion>raphe nuclei</BrainRegion> near the midline, but rather expand laterally in the <BrainRegion>reticular formation</BrainRegion>. This expanded distribution of the neurons in the anterior group results in a partial fusion of the nuclei. In some nuclei, particularly the <BrainRegion>median raphe</BrainRegion>, subdivisions can be clearly delineated on the basis of the distinct morphology of the neurons and of their clustering. The neurons of the posterior group, in the <BrainRegion>caudal pons</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>medulla</BrainRegion>, are almost all contained within the limits of the <BrainRegion>raphe nuclei</BrainRegion>. The serotoninergic neurons located in the <BrainRegion>reticular formation</BrainRegion> form a lateral column, which is clearly separated from the serotoninergic neurons found near the midline. Immunoreactive axons are distributed throughout the <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion>, but they innervate certain <BrainRegion>motor and sensory nuclei</BrainRegion> more densely. It was consistently found in newborn animals that the overall immunoreactive axonal network was richer than in juveniles or adults, suggesting that there may be a major modification in the function of the serotoninergic system around birth.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Synaptogenesis in the <BrainRegion>primary visual cortex</BrainRegion> of the tree shrew (Tupaia belangeri).</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The <BrainRegion>primary visual cortex</BrainRegion> of the tree shrew is characterized by the lack of ocular dominance columns. The two eyes are represented in sublayers of laminae 3 and 4. In an earlier study using the transneuronal transport we observed that the <BrainRegion>geniculate</BrainRegion> afferents from the two eyes do not initially overlap and then segregate into their appropriate sublaminae. The final distribution pattern can already be observed during the early postnatal period. Since segregation and elimination of afferent terminal branches do not seem to take place, we wanted to investigate whether or not an overproduction of synapses can be observed as in several other animals. We examined layers 3B, 3C, 4A, and 4B, which receive afferents from the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> via the <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>, from P5 to maturity by using the electron microscope. The brain tissue was excised in the region where the central vision is represented in adult animals. Then we determined the density of synapses per 100 microns 2 neuropil for each of the four sublayers at the ages P5, P15, P19, P23, P31, and P42 and in the adult animal (AD). In determining the neuropil we measured the size of two additional compartments, i.e., the compartments consisting of perikarya and of blood vessels. At a higher resolution we determined the fraction of Gray type I and type II synapses in each sublamina and in each developmental stage. The size of the neuropil increases from 57% at P5 to 81% in adult animal(AD) whereas the compartment of perikarya decreases from 42% to 15% and the compartment of blood vessels increases from 1.3% to 3.9%. The synaptic density starts with very low values (3.5/100 microns 2) at P5. Then it increases rapidly and attains a maximal rate of increase during the period of eyelid opening. After this period the increase is slowed down and approaches the adult value (12.5/100 microns 2) slowly. An overproduction of synapses could not be observed. The percentage of type I and type II synapses also changes during this period. The fraction of type I synapses amounts to 73% at P5 and increases to 92% in adult animal(AD) . The increase in density of type I synapses is continuous and does not show any sign of overproduction. The density of type II synapses rapidly reaches it final value and then remains constant. Possibly there is a slight overproduction during the period of eyelid opening.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>The early development of the <BrainRegion>optic nerve</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>chiasm</BrainRegion> in embryonic rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>To establish the time course and major features of the development of the <BrainRegion>optic nerve</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>chiasm</BrainRegion> in the embryonic rat, the growth of axons from the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> to the brain has been studied by light and electron microscopy. On embryonic day 14 (E14), the first axons are generated by <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> ganglion cells. Fascicles of axons can be detected in the <BrainRegion>optic stalk</BrainRegion> at embryonic day 14(E14) .5 and in the <BrainRegion>diencephalon</BrainRegion> by E15.0. In the <BrainRegion>vitreal retina</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>optic fissure</BrainRegion>, large extracellular spaces resemble the oriented channels previously described in the mouse. They form approximately 12 hours before the invasion of optic axons and contain hyaluronic acid. In the <BrainRegion>optic stalk</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>diencephalon</BrainRegion> of the rat, similar spaces are not present, but the timed autolysis of neuroepithelial cells could provide a pathway of minimal resistance for the earliest axons. Degenerating cells are prominent in the <BrainRegion>ventral stalk</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>rostral diencephalon</BrainRegion> prior to the arrival of the first optic axons that preferentially invade these regions. The role of pigment in the development of visual pathways is controversial. In one strain of rat, Manchester Hooded, the <BrainRegion>retinae</BrainRegion> are heavily pigmented, but little pigment is seen at any stage in the stalk; in albinos, pigment is absent from both <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> and stalk. However, the distribution of axons within the developing <BrainRegion>optic stalk</BrainRegion> is very similar in both strains, suggesting that the reduction in size of the ipsilateral pathway observed in the albino rat compared with the Manchester Hooded is not due to a lack of pigment in the <BrainRegion>optic stalk</BrainRegion> early in development. Several factors previously reported to contribute to the development of retinotopic order in other species are also present in the rat. These include the sequence in which axons grow into the stalk, and fasciculation. Intermembranous contacts observed between growth cones and adjacent tissues suggest one mechanism by which fasciculation occurs. A small group of fascicles, which may represent the ipsilateral projection, diverges from the crossing fibers on E15.5, without evidence of being deflected by any glial or other structures.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Schwann cell behavior after nerve repair by means of tissue-engineered muscle-vein combined guides.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Schwann cells play a critical role in peripheral nerve regeneration. When a non-nervous conduit is used to bridge a nerve defect, the conduit is soon colonized by a number of Schwann cells that make a pathway for regrowing axons. By using electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis, we have investigated the behavior of migratory glial cells along a particular type of autologous tissue-engineered conduit made of a vein filled with fresh skeletal muscle, using the rat sciatic nerve model. With this particular type of autograft, our data show that many Schwann cells soon take up a close relationship with grafted muscle fibers, and especially with their basal lamina, which appears to serve as a migration pathway for them. The early and massive colonization of the conduit is sustained by both Schwann cell migration and proliferation, as demonstrated by PCNA immunostaining. Later, as they meet regenerating axons, Schwann cells become closely associated with them and eventually lose their connections with grafted muscle fibers because of the formation of perineurial envelopes. Because previous studies showed that alpha(2a-2b) NRG1 is overexpressed at early stages along the muscle-vein combined tubes, we have also investigated mRNA expression of its two receptors, erbB2 and erbB3. Both messengers are overexpressed, although with different time courses. Overall, our results provide some morphological and biochemical bases for explaining the effectiveness of fresh muscle-vein combined nerve guides and throw an interesting light on the possible role of alpha(2a-2b) NRG1 through the erbB2/erbB3 heterodimer receptor for nerve regeneration inside non-nervous conduits.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Evidence for subdivisions in the human <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The human suprachiasmatic nucleus was analysed by immunohistochemical demonstration of various substances in combination with 3-dimensional computerized reconstruction and video overlay facilities. In the human, the <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion> is not as compact as in the rodent. Its boundaries are not easily delineated using conventional stains, and it shows no obvious cytoarchitectonic structure. However, based on its chemoarchitecture, the human <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion> can be apportioned into five major subdivisions: Dorsal, comprising a crescent shaped mass of densely packed neurophysin/vasopressin-neurons as well as neurotensin-neurons, and also containing 3-fucosyl-N-acetyl-lactosamine (FAL)-positive neurons in its medial part. Central, occupying the core of the nucleus and consisting precisely of a region devoid of neurophysin/vasopressin neurons but demarcated by calbindin, synaptophysin, and a circumscribed cluster of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-neurons and containing neurotensin neurons as well. Anteroventrally this division also contains some intermingled neurons positive for neurotensin, neuropeptide Y, somatostatin, and 3-fucosyl-N-acetyl-lactosamine(FAL) . Ventral, extending from the anterior extreme of the <BrainRegion>preoptic recess</BrainRegion> caudolaterally to a field between the <BrainRegion>optic chiasm</BrainRegion> and the anteroventral margin of the <BrainRegion>supraoptic nucleus</BrainRegion>. This subdivision is specified by synaptophysin, calbindin, and substance P immunoreactivity and is almost free of glial fibrillary acidic protein. From its rostral portion, fibers immunoreactive for calbindin, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, synaptophysin, and substance P protrude deeply into the <BrainRegion>optic chiasm</BrainRegion>. Medial, comprising a thin band between the subependymal zone and the dorsal subdivision, containing scattered somatostatin neurons. External, extending as a band around the dorsal and lateral borders of the nucleus, containing astrocytes expressing the 3-fucosyl-N-acetyl-lactosamine(FAL) -epitope and scattered neurophysin/vasopressin and neurotensin neurons. These findings indicate that the human <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion> contains well-defined subdivisions with different, chemically specific, connections and provides a basis for comparing these subdivisions with the structure and function of subdivisions previously described for the <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion> in experimental animals. In addition, the findings strengthen the concept that the human <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion> generates and expresses circadian rhythms in a manner similar to that documented for the <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion> in experimental animals, and suggest that different subdivisions may subserve specific functional roles.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<AbstractText>Refinement of the <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> pathways to the <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion> (SC) and <BrainRegion>dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion> (dLGN) is mediated by nitric oxide (NO). Long-term depression (LTD) can also be induced in <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion>(SC) and <BrainRegion>LGN</BrainRegion> during the time at which these pathways are refined, and this Long-term depression(LTD) is partially dependent on nitric oxide(NO) and L-type Ca(2+) channel function. In an effort to determine whether nitric oxide(NO) -mediated pathway refinement is also mediated by Ca(2+) channel function, we have examined the refinement of the retinocollicular and <BrainRegion>retinogeniculate</BrainRegion> pathways in mice which lack the gene for the Ca(2+) channel beta(3) subunit (CCKO) and which have significantly reduced L-type Ca(2+) currents. Injections of the anterograde tracer cholera toxin subunit B/HRP were made into one eye of these knockout animals and in wild-type mice ages postnatal day (P) 13, P19, and P26. After 48 hours, mice were perfused and sections processed by using tetramethylbenzidine histochemistry. Labeling distribution in some animals was analyzed quantitatively. Obvious differences in the distribution of the ipsilateral retinocollicular pathway were observed at P15, with the pathway being more exuberant in CCKO mice. This difference was statistically significant. More subtle differences were seen at P21 and P28. Obvious differences were also seen in the <BrainRegion>contralateral retinogeniculate</BrainRegion> pathway which in CCKO mice filled most of the domain normally occupied by ipsilateral eye fibers. This difference was also statistically significant. We conclude that reduction in L-type Ca(2+) currents has an effect on axonal refinement similar to that which occurs in nitric oxide(NO) knockout mice, which supports the possibility that L-type Ca(2+) channel-dependent Long-term depression(LTD) mediates nitric oxide(NO) -dependent axonal refinement.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>New high-resolution 2-deoxyglucose method featuring double labeling and automated data collection.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>A new approach to high-resolution 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) emulsion-autoradiography which combines improved retention of 2-deoxy-D-glucose(2DG) labeling, staining with immunohistochemical and other specific markers, and automated data collection and analysis of local silver grain and stain densities is described. The Durham et al. (J. Neurosci. 1:519-526, &apos;81) procedure for fixation of 2-deoxy-D-glucose(2DG) with periodate-lysine-paraformaldehyde (PLP, McLean and Nakane: J. Histochem. Cytochem. 22:1077-1083, '74) was adapted to increase retained label roughly tenfold. Phenobarbital anesthesia is induced 45 minutes after 2-deoxy-D-glucose(2DG) injection. Barbiturate anesthesia increases brain glycogen (Nelson et al.: J. Neurochem. 15:1271-1279, '68) and presumably increases the incorporation of intracellular 2-deoxy-D-glucose(2DG) from 2-deoxy-D-glucose(2DG) -6P into brain glycogen and other molecules (Nelson et al.: J. Neurochem. 43:949-956, '84; Pentreath et al.: Neuroscience 7:759-767, '82). Iodoacetate is added to cold fixative to prevent glycogen breakdown (Cammermeyer and Fenton: Histochemistry 76:339-356, '82). This high-resolution 2-deoxy-D-glucose(2DG) protocol is directly compatible with many other neuroanatomical techniques. We demonstrate 2-deoxy-D-glucose(2DG) emulsion autoradiography combined with cytochrome oxidase (CO) histochemistry, markers for axonal pathway tracing, plastic embedding for semithin sections, and immunohistochemical staining for glutamate decarboxylase (GAD). The method should be compatible with antibodies for other antigens and with other neuroanatomical stains. To collect the data directly from microscope slides, a computer-controlled microscope was integrated with image-processing software to eliminate the need for manual counting and scoring of autoradiograms. Regions of interest are scanned automatically at high resolution to map regional labeling and/or stain density. There is excellent correspondence between computer-enhanced two-dimensional maps of the data and the original autoradiograms. Automated counts for five specimens were compared to counts of labeled cells by trained observer. The correlation between the two sets of measurements is high (r = .93). Automated data collection has been generalized to measure regional stain densities on the autoradiographed sections for direct comparison with silver grain density. The method is extremely flexible, especially since new image-processing strategies can be developed in software to extract the desired information from materials labeled by other methods (e.g., HRP).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Development of the spinocerebellar system in the postnatal rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The distribution of <BrainRegion>spinocerebellar</BrainRegion> projections from birth to adulthood in rats was analyzed by anterograde and retrograde tracing methods. A correlation between mossy fiber synaptogenesis and the establishment of <BrainRegion>spinocerebellar</BrainRegion> topography was also investigated with electron microscopy. Experiments with retrograde transport techniques indicate that the spinal axons reach the <BrainRegion>cerebellum</BrainRegion> in two successive groups: the first one, appearing prenatally, contains axons from neurons in the <BrainRegion>central cervical nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>Clarke&apos;s column</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>sacral nucleus of Stilling</BrainRegion>, as well as from border cells. The second group, which reaches the <BrainRegion>cerebellum</BrainRegion> by P3, arises from new neurons of the same nuclear regions and from scattered cells of the <BrainRegion>spinal gray matter</BrainRegion>. The distribution and the morphological appearance of the spinal cells change between P1 and P3 and give the adult pattern by P7. The establishment of <BrainRegion>spinocerebellar</BrainRegion> projections occurs in four successive stages. In a first stage, spinal axons reach the <BrainRegion>cerebellum</BrainRegion> and occupy the prospective <BrainRegion>white matter of the anterior vermal lobe</BrainRegion> and of the <BrainRegion>pyramis</BrainRegion>. Later, during a &quot;waiting" stage between P1 and P3, the spinal fibers become denser in the central white matter of both their anterior and posterior target zones but do not penetrate the gray matter. From P3 to P5 the protocolumnar stage takes place, and spinal axons invade the <BrainRegion>granular layer of the anterior lobe</BrainRegion>, where they begin to be organized in nascent sagittal columns. At the end of this stage, identifiable synaptic contacts between mossy terminals and granule cell dendrites are first observed in the anterior lobe by electron microscopy. In the <BrainRegion>pyramis</BrainRegion>, invasion of the granular layer begins only at P5. Between P5 and P7 the low intercolumnar dispersion of spinal fibers disappears and the projection reaches its fourth and final stage, characterized by a columnar organization corresponding to the adult pattern of the <BrainRegion>spinocerebellar</BrainRegion> projection. These results indicate that (1) the adult pattern of <BrainRegion>spinocerebellar</BrainRegion> projections is attained by P7. (2) The asynchronous invasion of the <BrainRegion>gray matter in the anterior and posterior lobes</BrainRegion> may be related to the chronology of mossy fiber maturation in these regions. (3) There is a temporal correlation between the columnar organization of the spinal axons and the appearance of the earliest-maturing mossy rosettes. However, a clear relationship between synaptogenesis and topographic organization could not be demonstrated.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Morphology and soma-dendritic distribution of synaptic endings from the <BrainRegion>rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus</BrainRegion> (riMLF) on motoneurons in the <BrainRegion>oculomotor and trochlear nuclei</BrainRegion> in the cat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The morphology and soma-dendritic distribution of anterograde biocytin-labelled <BrainRegion>rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus</BrainRegion> (riMLF) synaptic endings in the <BrainRegion>oculomotor and trochlear nuclei</BrainRegion> have been examined by electron microscopy by using both preembedding immunoperoxidase and postembedding immunogold methods. The results indicate that three morphological types of <BrainRegion>rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus</BrainRegion>(riMLF) synaptic endings are distinguishable on the basis of synaptic vesicle morphology (spheroidal, pleiomorphic, or ellipsoidal) and postsynaptic membrane specializations (asymmetrical or symmetrical). All three morphological types of <BrainRegion>rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus</BrainRegion>(riMLF) synaptic endings establish synaptic connections predominantly with dendrites. Synaptic endings that contain ellipsoidal synaptic vesicles have a more proximal soma-dendritic distribution than those that contain either spheroidal or pleiomorphic synaptic vesicles. Furthermore, all three morphological types of synaptic endings are encountered in the same motoneuron subdivisions of the <BrainRegion>oculomotor and trochlear nuclei</BrainRegion> in the same experiments. The findings suggest that subregions of the <BrainRegion>rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus</BrainRegion>(riMLF) contain coexistent populations of excitatory and inhibitory premotor neurons that are related to opposite directions of vertical saccadic eye movements but that project to the same motoneuron subgroups on the ipsilateral side. Both the morphology and the mode, pattern, and soma-dendritic distribution of saccade-related <BrainRegion>rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus</BrainRegion>(riMLF) synaptic endings that establish synaptic connections with vertical motoneurons differ from those of excitatory and inhibitory second-order vertical vestibular synaptic endings. These differences in the synaptic organization of <BrainRegion>rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus</BrainRegion>(riMLF) and second-order vestibular inputs to <BrainRegion>oculomotor</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>trochlear</BrainRegion> motoneurons may be related to differences in the information transferred by each source, the <BrainRegion>rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus</BrainRegion>(riMLF) input conveying eye-velocity signals, and the vestibular input conveying eye-position signals.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>The chandelier cell of the human <BrainRegion>visual cortex</BrainRegion>: a Golgi study.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The size, location, distribution, and spatial orientation of the chandelier cell of the human <BrainRegion>visual cortex</BrainRegion> are described for the first time. The rapid Golgi method has been utilized to study the structural features of these inhibitory interneurons. The human chandelier cell is a small stellate interneuron with prominent idiodendritic and idioaxonic arborizations. These arborizations are distributed within a narrow rectangular tissue slab that measures approximately 300 X 200 X 100 microns. This relatively small and narrow functional territory is oriented perpendicular to the pial surface and to the long axis of the gyrus. The territory of distribution of its axon is larger than and encloses that of its dendrites. The number of specific axonic terminals (candles) per chandelier cell is also relatively small, ranging from 60 to 80 units. These axonic terminals represent the functional units of the neuron and reflect the number of pyramidal cell axons contacted by it. The chandelier cell of the human <BrainRegion>visual cortex</BrainRegion> possibly represents the smallest neuron of this kind described to date. The size of its functional territory and the number of its specific axonic terminals are among the smallest of any neuron of this kind thus far described. It is postulated herein that in the course of mammalian phylogeny the chandelier cell shows a tendency toward a progressive reduction in the size of its functional territory and in the number of its functional units (candles), as well as a tendency toward a more &quot;idio" pattern of distribution for its axonic and dendritic arborizations. Perhaps, these progressive evolutionary modifications could reflect a tendency of this type of interneuron toward an increasing specialization. The possible existence of a relationship between the progressive transformation of the chandelier cell and the increasing visual acuity, dexterity, and skillfulness in the course of mammalian phylogeny should be explored.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Expression of dopamine and vesicular monoamine transporters and differential vulnerability of mesostriatal dopaminergic neurons.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Numerous studies suggest that the dopamine transporter (DAT), responsible for dopamine reuptake, may act as a vulnerability factor in the pathogenesis of Parkinson&apos;s disease (PD) and the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT2), responsible for its vesicular storage, as a neuroprotective factor. However, the relevance of each on the differential vulnerability of <BrainRegion>midbrain</BrainRegion> DA cells remains unknown. Here we studied the relationship between the expression pattern (mRNA and protein) of both transporters and the differential vulnerability of <BrainRegion>midbrain</BrainRegion> DA cells in a model of Parkinson&apos;s disease(PD) (intracerebroventricular injection of 6-OHDA in rats) and in monkey and human <BrainRegion>midbrain</BrainRegion>. Our results revealed that the expression patterns for VMAT2 mRNA and protein and dopamine transporter(DAT) mRNA are similar, with the highest levels in the <BrainRegion>rostromedial region of substantia nigra</BrainRegion> (SNrm), followed by the <BrainRegion>caudoventral region of SN</BrainRegion> (SNcv), the <BrainRegion>ventral tegmental area</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>pigmented parabrabraquial nucleus</BrainRegion> (VTA/PBP), and finally the <BrainRegion>linear and interfascicular nuclei</BrainRegion> (Li/IF). In contrast, the expression of dopamine transporter(DAT) protein in rats, monkeys, and humans followed a caudoventrolateral-to-rostrodorsomedial decreasing gradient (SNcv &amp;gt; SNrm &gt; VTA/PBP &gt; linear and interfascicular nuclei(Li/IF) ), matching the degeneration profile observed after intracerebroventricular injection of 6-OHDA and in Parkinson's disease(PD) . In addition, dopamine transporter(DAT) blockade made all <BrainRegion>midbrain</BrainRegion> DA cells equally resistant to 6-OHDA. These data indicate that dopamine transporter(DAT) protein levels, but not dopamine transporter(DAT) mRNA levels, are closely related to the differential vulnerability of <BrainRegion>midbrain</BrainRegion> DA cells and that this relationship is unaffected by the relative levels of VMAT2. Furthermore, the difference between dopamine transporter(DAT) mRNA and protein profiles suggests internuclear differences in its posttransductional regulation.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Immunocytochemical localization of dopamine and its synthetic enzymes in the central nervous system of the lamprey Lampetra fluviatilis.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The distribution of dopamine (DA)-containing cell bodies, fibers, and terminals in the brain and <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> of Lampetra fluviatilis was investigated by immunohistochemical means. In order to distinguish dopaminergic neurons from those using other catecholamines as the primary neurotransmitter, the distribution of dopamine-immunoreactive structures was compared to that of cell bodies, fibers, and terminals labelled with antibodies directed against the enzymes tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC), dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH), and phenylethanolamine-N-methyl transferase (PNMT). We define dopaminergic neurons as those that are simultaneously dopamine(DA) , tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) , and L-amino acid decarboxylase(AADC) immunoreactive and at the same time dopamine beta-hydroxylase(DBH) and phenylethanolamine-N-methyl transferase(PNMT) nonreactive. The overall concentrations of dopamine, noradrenaline, and adrenaline and some of their metabolites were also measured via high-performance liquid chromatography of whole-brain extracts. Our results revealed the presence of 10 populations of dopaminergic neurons in the brain of the lamprey in the <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>preoptic area</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>rhombencephalon</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>. In addition, uniquely dopamine(DA) -immunoreactive neurons, in contact with the cerebrospinal fluid, were observed in the <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>. Chromatography indicated that dopamine exists in considerably higher concentrations than noradrenaline in the lamprey brain, whereas adrenaline is absent, the latter finding being supported by our failure to observe any phenylethanolamine-N-methyl transferase(PNMT) -immunoreactive cell bodies, fibers, or terminals. The dopaminergic system of the lamprey appears to share many features not only with that of other anamniotes but also with that of amniotes; however, as in teleosts, dopaminergic neurons in the <BrainRegion>midbrain</BrainRegion> corresponding to the <BrainRegion>substantia nigra</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>retrorubral area</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>ventral tegmental area</BrainRegion> of other species do not exist in the lamprey.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Ultrastructural organization of choline-acetyltransferase-immunoreactive fibres innervating the <BrainRegion>neocortex</BrainRegion> from embryonic <BrainRegion>ventral forebrain</BrainRegion> grafts.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Suspension grafts of foetal tissue rich in cholinergic neurones were transplanted into the <BrainRegion>frontoparietal cortex</BrainRegion> of rats that had previously undergone deafferentation of the extrinsic cholinergic innervation of the cortex by injection of ibotenic acid into the <BrainRegion>nucleus basalis magnocellularis</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> tissue containing the graft was processed for electron microscopic immunocytochemistry by using a monoclonal antibody to choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) in order to examine the contacts established between cholinergic fibres from the graft and the host <BrainRegion>neocortex</BrainRegion>. The density, distribution, and targets of this graft-host innervation were compared with those seen in the intact and deafferented <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion>. choline acetyltransferase(ChAT) -positive fibres in both grafted and control animals formed extensive synaptic connections with various <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> neural elements--those of graft origin being of similar morphology to those in the intact <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion>. However, the distribution of postsynaptic <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> targets of the graft-derived choline acetyltransferase(ChAT) -immunoreactive boutons was abnormal, such that a greater percentage of such terminals formed synaptic contacts with neuronal perikarya, especially layer V pyramidal neurones, than was seen in control brains. It is possible that the formation of new synaptic contacts between the embryonic graft and host <BrainRegion>frontoparietal cortex</BrainRegion> may, in part, be necessary for the restoration of functional activity that has been previously reported in these grafted animals.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Development of lateral line organs in the axolotl.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Lateral line sensory receptors and their <BrainRegion>cranial nerves</BrainRegion> in axolotls arise from a dorsolateral series of placodes, including the octaval placode, that gives rise to the <BrainRegion>inner ear</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>octaval nerve</BrainRegion>. Anterodorsal and anteroventral placodes occur rostral to the octaval placode and give rise to anterodorsal and anteroventral lateral line nerves and electroreceptors and mechanoreceptors of the snout, cheek, and lower jaw. Middle, supratemporal, and posterior placodes occur caudal to the octaval placode and give rise to similarly named lateral line nerves, electroreceptors and mechanoreceptors of the occipital region of the head, and trunk neuromasts. All placodes, except the posterior placode, elongate, forming sensory ridges, following the genesis of sensory ganglia. Primary mechanoreceptor primordia begin to form within the central zone of the sensory ridges at stage 36; primary electroreceptor primordia originate within the lateral zones of these ridges at stage 38. The first primary mechanoreceptors erupt during stage 37; all primary mechanoreceptors have erupted at hatching (stage 41). Primary electroreceptors begin to erupt at stage 43. Secondary mechanoreceptor primordia begin to form in 1-week-old larvae and erupt 1-2 weeks later. Secondary electroreceptor primordia also begin to form in 1-week-old larvae and continue until clusters of two to five electroreceptors are formed. The developmental stages thought to characterize lateral line placodes in the earliest gnathostomes suggest that this ancestral ontogeny has been truncated in modern amphibians, and ontogenetic mechanisms underlying placodal differentiation are suggested.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Terminal dendritic sprouting and reactive synaptogenesis in the postnatal <BrainRegion>organ of Corti</BrainRegion> in culture.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Synaptogenesis in the <BrainRegion>organ of Corti</BrainRegion> between the primary receptors, the inner hair cells, and the peripheral processes of their afferent spiral ganglion neurons in the mouse lasts for 5 days postnatally (Sobkowicz et al. [1986] J. Neurocytol. 15:693-714). The transplantation of the organ into culture at the fifth postnatal day induces a reactive sprouting of dendritic terminals and an extensive formation of new ribbon synapses within 24 hours. This reactive synaptogenesis differs strikingly from the primary synaptogenesis and has been seen thus far only in the inner hair cells. The synaptically engaged neuronal endings sprout a multitude of filopodia that intussuscept the inner hair cells. The filopodial tips contain a heavy electron-dense matter that appears to attract the synaptic ribbons, which form new synaptic contacts with the growing processes. The intensity of the filopodial growth and synaptogenesis subsides in about 3 days; the filopodia undergo resorption, leaving behind fibrous cytoplasmic plaques mostly stored in the supranuclear part of the hair cells. However, occasional filopodial growth and formation of new synaptic connections continued. The data demonstrate that any disruption or disturbance of the initial synaptic contacts between the inner hair cells and their afferent neurons caused by transplantation results in prompt synaptic reacquisition. Furthermore, we suggest that the transitory phase of terminal sprouting and multiribbon synapse formation manifests a trophic dependence that develops postnatally between the synaptic cells.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Intracellular labeling of neurons in the <BrainRegion>medial accessory olive</BrainRegion> of the cat: II. Ultrastructure of dendritic spines and their GABAergic innervation.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>In order to describe the morphology of dendritic spines of identified neurons in the cat <BrainRegion>inferior olive</BrainRegion> together with their gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) synaptic input, a technique was used combining intracellular labeling of horseradish peroxidase with postembedding gold-immunocytochemistry. With this technique physiologically identified <BrainRegion>olivary</BrainRegion> cells were reconstructed with the light microscope, and the horseradish peroxidase reaction product and immunogold labeling were subsequently examined in serial sections at the ultrastructural level. In addition, a degenerating neuron was observed, resulting in a triple labeling in single ultrathin sections. Quantitative and three-dimensional analysis showed that the dendritic spines were composed of long, thin stalks ending in one or more spine heads. The spines of cells located in the <BrainRegion>caudal half of the medial accessory olive</BrainRegion> (type I cells, characterized by dendrites which run away from the soma) were found to be less complex than those of cells located rostrally in this <BrainRegion>olivary subnucleus</BrainRegion> (type II cells, characterized by dendrites which tend to turn back towards the soma). Most, if not all, of the spines of both cell types were located within glomeruli. On average, the spines within individual glomeruli originated from 6 different dendrites (with a maximum of 8). Different spines within the same glomerulus were never derived from different dendrites of the same <BrainRegion>olivary</BrainRegion> neuron, but single spines frequently gave rise to several spine heads, which could be located either within different glomeruli or inside a single glomerulus. The glomerular spine heads originating from the same spine were rarely located near one another. All spines and most of the spine heads were contacted by both gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) ergic and non- gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) ergic terminals. Most of the gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) ergic terminals contained pleomorphical vesicles and displayed symmetric synapses whereas the non- gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) ergic terminals showed usually round to oval vesicles and asymmetric synapses.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Connections of the octopus <BrainRegion>optic lobe</BrainRegion>: an HRP study.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The major visual centers of the octopus central nervous system are the paired <BrainRegion>optic lobes</BrainRegion>. Bidirectional transport of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was used to determine connections of the <BrainRegion>optic lobe</BrainRegion>. Cells afferent to the <BrainRegion>optic lobe</BrainRegion> were identified by retrograde horseradish peroxidase(HRP) transport in the following <BrainRegion>lobes of the central ganglia: anterior basal, median basal, dorsal basal, interbasal, subvertical, precommissural, brachial, and magnocellular</BrainRegion>. Labeled cells were also observed within the <BrainRegion>contralateral optic lobe</BrainRegion>, various <BrainRegion>optic tract lobes</BrainRegion> bilaterally, and in photoreceptors of the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral retina</BrainRegion>. Additionally, individual fibers, in part originating from cells in the <BrainRegion>posterior subvertical lobe</BrainRegion>, were labeled within the central neuropil core of various vertical lobules. Differences in results between superficial and deep <BrainRegion>optic lobe medulla</BrainRegion> injections indicate that some afferent projections from central sources may terminate on cell populations at specific depths within the lobe. Efferent <BrainRegion>optic lobe</BrainRegion> fibers into the <BrainRegion>superior frontal and lateral basal lobes</BrainRegion> were labeled by anterograde transport. Other possible <BrainRegion>optic lobe</BrainRegion> efferent projections terminated in <BrainRegion>supraesophageal lobes</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>magnocellular lobe</BrainRegion>. The many inputs to the <BrainRegion>optic lobe</BrainRegion> from higher motor and associative centers in the central ganglia emphasize that the <BrainRegion>medulla region of the optic lobe</BrainRegion> is an exceptionally complex integrative area.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Spinal</BrainRegion> afferents to functionally distinct <BrainRegion>periaqueductal gray columns</BrainRegion> in the rat: an anterograde and retrograde tracing study.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The segmental and laminar organization of <BrainRegion>spinal</BrainRegion> projections to the functionally distinct <BrainRegion>ventrolateral (vlPAG) and lateral periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion> ( <BrainRegion>lateral periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion>(lPAG) ) columns was examined by using retrograde and anterograde tracing techniques. It was found 1) that <BrainRegion>spinal</BrainRegion> input to both <BrainRegion>v lateral periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion>(lPAG) and <BrainRegion>lateral periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion>(lPAG) columns arose predominantly from neurons in the upper <BrainRegion>cervical (C1-4) and sacral spinal cord</BrainRegion>; 2) that there was a topographical separation of <BrainRegion>vl-PAG</BrainRegion> projecting and <BrainRegion>lateral periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion>(lPAG) -projecting neurons within the upper <BrainRegion>cervical spinal cord</BrainRegion>; but 3) that below <BrainRegion>spinal segment C4</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>v lateral periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion>(lPAG) -projecting and <BrainRegion>lateral periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion>(lPAG) -projecting spinal neurons were similarly distributed, predominantly within contralateral lamina I, the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the dorsolateral fasciculus</BrainRegion> (the <BrainRegion>lateral spinal nucleus</BrainRegion>) and the lateral (reticular) part of lamina V. Consistent with the retrograde results, the greatest density of anterograde label, within both the <BrainRegion>v lateral periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion>(lPAG) and <BrainRegion>lateral periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion>(lPAG) , was found after tracer injections made either in the superficial or deep <BrainRegion>dorsal horn of the upper cervical spinal cord</BrainRegion>. Tracer injections made within the <BrainRegion>thoraco-lumbar spinal cord</BrainRegion> revealed that the <BrainRegion>v lateral periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion>(lPAG) column received a convergent input from both the superficial and deep <BrainRegion>dorsal horn</BrainRegion>. However, <BrainRegion>thoraco-lumbar</BrainRegion> input to the <BrainRegion>lateral periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion>(lPAG) was found to arise uniquely from the <BrainRegion>superficial dorsal horn</BrainRegion>; whereas the <BrainRegion>deep dorsal horn</BrainRegion> was found to innervate the <BrainRegion>&quot;juxta-aqueductal" PAG region</BrainRegion> rather than projecting to the <BrainRegion>lateral periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion>(lPAG) . These findings suggest that similar to spino-parabrachial projections, <BrainRegion>spinal</BrainRegion> projections to the <BrainRegion>lateral periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion>(lPAG) (and <BrainRegion>juxta-aqueductal PAG</BrainRegion>) are topographically organised, with distinct <BrainRegion>subgroups of spinal neurons</BrainRegion> projecting to specific <BrainRegion>lateral periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion>(lPAG) or <BrainRegion>juxta-aqueductal PAG subregions</BrainRegion>. In contrast, the <BrainRegion>v lateral periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion>(lPAG) receives a convergent <BrainRegion>spinal</BrainRegion> input which arises from the superficial and deep <BrainRegion>dorsal horn of cervical, thoracic, lumbar, and sacral spinal segments</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Evidence for a high density of secretoneurin-like immunoreactivity in the extended <BrainRegion>amygdala</BrainRegion> of the rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Secretoneurin is a novel 33-amino-acid neuropeptide produced by endoproteolytic processing from secretogranin II, which is a member of the chromogranin/secretogranin family. In this immunocytochemical study, we compared the distribution pattern of secretoneurin immunoreactivity with that of tyrosine hydroxylase, calbindin, substance P, and Leu-enkephalin in adjacent sections of rat <BrainRegion>forebrain</BrainRegion>. Secretoneurin appeared mainly in varicosities and fibers. Only a few cell bodies were stained. In the <BrainRegion>nucleus accumbens</BrainRegion>, a partial overlap of secretoneurin-immunoreactive patches with enkephalin-immunopositive areas was found. Secretoneurin displayed low to moderate levels of immunoreaction in calbindin-rich as well as in calbindin-immunonegative areas of the <BrainRegion>caudate-putamen</BrainRegion>. In the <BrainRegion>globus pallidus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>entopeduncular nucleus</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>substantia nigra</BrainRegion>, secretoneurin immunoreactivity was oriented ventromedially preferentially in woolly fibers. The dense immunostaining in the <BrainRegion>medial nucleus accumbens</BrainRegion> was directly continuous with dense secretoneurin immunoreactivity in the <BrainRegion>bed nucleus of the stria terminalis</BrainRegion>. Two strongly secretoneurin-immunopositive bands, one in the sublenticular portion and a smaller one along the <BrainRegion>posterior limb of the anterior commissure</BrainRegion>, interconnected the highly secretoneurin-immunopositive <BrainRegion>centromedial amygdala</BrainRegion> with the <BrainRegion>bed nucleus of the stria terminalis</BrainRegion>. Thus, the distribution pattern of secretoneurin immunoreactivity provides a marker of the extended <BrainRegion>amygdala</BrainRegion> that forms a continuum between the <BrainRegion>centromedial amygdala</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>bed nucleus of the stria terminalis</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Intact sorting, targeting, and clustering of gamma-aminobutyric acid A receptor subtypes in <BrainRegion>hippocampal</BrainRegion> neurons in vitro.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The cellular and subcellular distribution of four GABA(A) receptor subtypes, identified by the presence of the alpha1, alpha2, alpha3, or alpha5 subunit, was investigated immunocytochemically in dissociated cultures of <BrainRegion>hippocampal</BrainRegion> neurons. We addressed the questions whether (1) cell-type specific expression, (2) axonal/somatodendritic targeting, and (3) synaptic/extrasynaptic clustering of GABA(A) receptor subtypes was retained in vitro. For comparison, the in vivo distribution pattern was assessed in sections from adult rat brain. The differential expression of GABA(A) receptor subunits allowed to identify five morphologically distinct cell types in culture: the alpha1 subunit was observed in glutamic acid decarboxylase-positive interneurons, the alpha2 and alpha5 subunits marked pyramidal-like cells, and the alpha3 subunit labeled three additional cell types, including presumptive hilar cells. All subunits were found in the somatodendritic compartment. In addition, appropriate axonal targeting was evidenced by the intense alpha2, and sometimes alpha3 subunit labeling of axon-initial segments (AIS) of pyramidal cells and hilar cells, respectively. Accordingly, both receptor subtypes were targeted to axon-initial segments(AIS) in vivo, as well. Synaptic receptors were identified by colocalization with gephyrin, a postsynaptic clustering protein, and apposition to presynaptic terminals labeled with synapsin I. In vitro and in vivo, alpha1- and alpha2-receptor subtypes formed numerous synaptic clusters, alpha3-GABA(A) receptors were located either synaptically or extrasynaptically depending on the cell type, whereas alpha5-GABA(A) receptors were extrasynaptic. We conclude that receptor targeting to broad subcellular locations does not require specific GABAergic innervation patterns, which are disturbed in vitro, but depends on protein-protein interactions in the postsynaptic cell that are both subunit- and neuron-specific.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Remodeling of the femoral chordotonal organ during metamorphosis of the hawkmoth, Manduca sexta.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>During metamorphosis of the moth, Manduca sexta, the larval legs degenerate and are replaced by adult legs with a diverse array of new sensory organs. The majority of the larval sensory neurons degenerate but some hair sensilla and chordotonal organ sensory neurons survive metamorphosis (Consoulas [2000] J. Comp. Neurol. 419:154-174). In the present study nerve-tracing techniques, birth-date labeling (5-bromodeoxyuridine), and electrophysiology were used to describe the remodeling of the femoral chordotonal organ (FCO) in the prothoracic legs. The larval femoral chordotonal organ(FCO) is composed of two scoloparia, which are associated with separate apodemes. At the onset of metamorphosis, some of the 13 larval neurons degenerate, together with the larval femoral chordotonal organ(FCO) apodemes. The remaining larval femoral chordotonal organ(FCO) sensory neurons persist in the imaginal leg to become the precursors of the adult femoral and tibial chordotonal organs respectively. Early in the pupal stage, 45 to 60 new sensory neurons are generated de novo and become associated with 6 persistent larval neurons in the imaginal femur to compose the adult femoral chordotonal organ(FCO) . Two clusters of persistent and new neurons are enclosed into two scoloparia with short apodemes that eventually become fused. In both larval and adult stages, the femoral chordotonal organ(FCO) contains units that respond phasically and others that respond tonically to femorotibial movements. Nerve activity from the femoral chordotonal organ(FCO) neurons can be recorded continuously during the remodeling of the organ. A persistent leg flexor motoneuron receives inputs from the femoral chordotonal organ(FCO) sensory neurons in both larval and adult stages, offering the opportunity to investigate the remodeling of the neural circuits underlying the proprioceptive control of the femorotibial joint.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Medium-sized neurofilament protein related to maturation of a subset of <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> neurons.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Neurofilaments are typical structures of the neuronal cytoskeleton and participate in the formation and stabilization of the axonal and dendritic architecture. In this study, we have characterized a murine monoclonal antibody, FNP7, that is directed against the medium-sized neurofilament subunit NF-M. This antibody identifies a subset of neurons in the <BrainRegion>cerebral cortex</BrainRegion> of various species including human and in organotypic cultures of rat <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion>. In the <BrainRegion>neocortex</BrainRegion> of all species examined, the antibody labels pyramidal cells in layers III, V, and VI, with a distinctive laminar distribution between architectonic boundaries. In comparison with other antibodies directed against NF-M, the FNP7 antibody identifies on blots two forms of NF-M that appear relatively late during development, at the time when dynamic growth of processes changes to the stabilization of the formed processes. Dephosphorylation with alkaline phosphatase unmasks the site, making it detectable for the FNP7 antibody. The late appearance suggests that the site is present during early development in phosphorylated form and with increasing maturation becomes dephosphorylated, mainly in dendrites. This event may relate to changes in cytoskeleton stability in a late phase of dendritic maturation. Furthermore, mainly corticofugal projections and only few <BrainRegion>callosal</BrainRegion> axons are stained, suggesting a differential phosphorylation in a subset of axons. The antibody provides a useful marker to study subsets of pyramidal cells in vivo, in vitro, and under experimental conditions.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Topographical organization of the motoneuron pools that innervate the muscles of the pinna of the cat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The topographical organization of the 22 motoneuron pools that innervate the pinna muscles of the cat was examined by injecting the B-subunit of cholera toxin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase into individual muscles. All 22 pools are found in the <BrainRegion>facial nucleus</BrainRegion>, organized as rostro-caudally oriented columns, and arranged according to the action of the muscles they innervate. Pools innervating muscles that pull the pinna dorsally are located in the dorsal two thirds of the medio-dorsal subdivision, and those innervating muscles that pull the pinna ventrally are located in the ventral one half of the nucleus. Motoneurons innervating muscles that pull the pinna cranially are located laterally, those that pull the pinna caudally are located medio-ventrally, and those that change the shape of the pinna are located along the entire dorso-ventral extent in the center of the medio-dorsal subdivision. This topographical layout is consistent with the somatotopic organization of the entire facial nucleus as demonstrated in a variety of species.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Connectional networks within the <BrainRegion>orbital and medial prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion> of macaque monkeys.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The intrinsic <BrainRegion>cortico</BrainRegion>-<BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> connections within the <BrainRegion>orbital and medial prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion> (OMPFC) were demonstrated with retrograde and anterograde tracers injected into each of the architectonic areas that constitute this region. Although many of the connections linked neighboring areas, others selectively connected relatively distant areas. Most, but not all, of the connections were reciprocal. Altogether, the connections formed at least two distinct networks within the <BrainRegion>orbital and medial prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion>(OMPFC) . The <BrainRegion>&quot;orbital" prefrontal network</BrainRegion> linked most of the areas within the <BrainRegion>orbital cortex</BrainRegion>, with very few connections to <BrainRegion>medial prefrontal areas</BrainRegion>. <BrainRegion>Areas Iam, Iapm, Ial, 12l, 12m, and 12r</BrainRegion> in the <BrainRegion>caudal and lateral parts of the orbital cortex</BrainRegion> (which received inputs from several sensory modalities) had convergent connections with <BrainRegion>areas 13l</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>13m</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>13b</BrainRegion> in the <BrainRegion>central orbital cortex</BrainRegion>, with further connections to the <BrainRegion>rostral orbital area 11l</BrainRegion>. For the connections between <BrainRegion>areas Iapm</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>Iam</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>Ial</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>13m</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>13l</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>11l</BrainRegion>, rostrally directed fibers arose mainly in layer V, whereas caudally directed fibers originated mainly in layer III. The <BrainRegion>&quot;medial" prefrontal network</BrainRegion> selectively involved <BrainRegion>medial areas 14r</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>14c</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>24</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>25</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>32</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>10m</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>rostral orbital areas 10o</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>11m</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>agranular insular area Iai</BrainRegion> in the <BrainRegion>posterior orbital cortex</BrainRegion>. Two <BrainRegion>orbital areas, 13a</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>12o</BrainRegion>, had substantial connections to both networks and may serve as points of interaction between them; otherwise there were relatively few interconnections. The two networks also had distinct connections with other <BrainRegion>cortical regions</BrainRegion>, with <BrainRegion>limbic structures</BrainRegion>, and with the <BrainRegion>mediodorsal thalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>. Their role in guidance of affective behaviour is discussed.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>AII amacrine cells in the distal inner nuclear layer of the mouse <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>We serendipitously found a distal Disabled-1 (Dab1)-immunoreactive cell in <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> of the C57BL/6J black mouse. The somata of these cells are located in the outermost part of the inner nuclear layer (INL). Their processes extend toward the outer plexiform layer (OPL), receiving synaptic inputs from horizontal and interplexiform cells. In the current study, we name this cell the &quot;distal Disabled-1(Dab1) -immunoreactive cell." Double-labeling experiments demonstrate that the distal Disabled-1(Dab1) -immunoreactive cell is not a horizontal cell. Rather, the distal Disabled-1(Dab1) cell appears to be a misplaced AII cell, by being glycine transporter-1-immunoreactive and by resembling the latter cell in an electron microscopic analysis. A distal Disabled-1(Dab1) cell had been reported in the FVB/N mouse <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>, a model of retinitis pigmentosa (Park et al. [2004] Cell Tissue Res 315:407-412). However, here, we found this distal Disabled-1(Dab1) -immunoreactive cell in the adult and normal developing mouse <BrainRegion>retinas</BrainRegion>. Hence, we show that such cells do not require the loss of photoreceptors as suggested previously (Park et al. [2004] Cell Tissue Res 315:407-412). Instead, two other pieces of data suggest an alternative explanation sources for distal Disabled-1(Dab1) cells. First, we find a correlation between the number of these cells in the left and right eyes Second, developmental analysis shows that the distal Disabled-1(Dab1) -immunoreactive cell is first observed shortly after birth. At the same time, AII cells emerge, extending their neurites into the <BrainRegion>inner retina</BrainRegion>. These data suggest that distal Disabled-1(Dab1) -immunoreactive cells are misplaced AII amacrine cells, resulting from genetically modulated anomalies owing to migration errors.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Novel peptide pancreastatin: its occurrence and codistribution with chromogranin A in the central nervous system of the pig.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The distribution of pancreastatin immunoreactivity was investigated in porcine brain, <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>dorsal root ganglia</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>pituitary</BrainRegion>. In the brain, immunoreactive cell bodies were present in many areas including the <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>basal ganglia</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>mesencephalic reticular formation</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>cerebellum</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>medulla oblongata</BrainRegion>. Immunoreactive fibres were most abundant in the <BrainRegion>globus pallidus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>stria terminalis</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>entopeduncular nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion>, and in the <BrainRegion>substantia nigra</BrainRegion>. In the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>, immunoreactive cells were found in laminae IV-IX. Immunoreactive fibres were concentrated in the <BrainRegion>dorsal horn</BrainRegion>. Pancreastatin immunoreactivity was localised to fibres and small cells (5-10% of the total) in the dorsal root ganglia. In the <BrainRegion>posterior pituitary</BrainRegion>, many immunoreactive fibres were present and in the anterior lobe subsets of gonadotrophs and thyrotrophs were pancreastatin-immunoreactive. The localisation of pancreastatin showed a parallel distribution with chromogranin A. Coexistence of pancreastatin with calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) immunoreactivity in cell bodies in the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>, including motoneurones, and with calcitonin gene-related peptide(CGRP) or galanin immunoreactivities in dorsal root ganglion cells was also noted. The differential pattern of pancreastatin immunostaining was reflected in the extractable levels of peptide with highest concentrations in the <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion> (55.8 +/- 6.0 pmol/g wet weight, mean +/- S.E.M.), <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion> (60.0 +/- 5.0 pmol/g), <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion> (54.4 +/- 6.5 pmol/g), and <BrainRegion>anterior pituitary</BrainRegion> (2,714 +/- 380 pmol/g). Characterisation of pancreastatin immunoreactivity in the <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>pituitary</BrainRegion> by gel permeation and high-pressure liquid chromatography revealed multiple molecular forms, one of which was indistinguishable from natural porcine pancreastatin. The widespread distribution of pancreastatin immunoreactivity suggests this peptide may play a part in several neuroendocrine, autonomic, somatic, and sensory functions, and its colocalisation with chromogranin A is consistent with a precursor-product relationship.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Organization of the reciprocal connections between the <BrainRegion>subiculum</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>entorhinal cortex</BrainRegion> in the cat: II. An electrophysiological study.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The projection of the <BrainRegion>entorhinal cortex</BrainRegion> (EC) to the <BrainRegion>subiculum</BrainRegion> (SUB) and the projection in the opposite direction from the <BrainRegion>subiculum</BrainRegion>(SUB) to the <BrainRegion>entorhinal cortex</BrainRegion>(EC) have been studied in the cat by using electrophysiological methods. Field potentials elicited by <BrainRegion>entorhinal cortex</BrainRegion>(EC) stimulation were recorded in the <BrainRegion>subiculum(</BrainRegion>SUB) . Different topographic distributions of the amplitude of the average evoked potentials (AEPs) were obtained depending on the place of stimulation along a lateromedial axis in the <BrainRegion>entorhinal cortex</BrainRegion>(EC) . Stimulation of the <BrainRegion>lateral entorhinal cortex</BrainRegion>(EC) elicited the largest average evoked potentials(AEPs) in the <BrainRegion>septal part of the subiculum</BrainRegion>(SUB) whereas stimulation of the <BrainRegion>medial entorhinal cortex</BrainRegion>(EC) evoked maximal responses in the <BrainRegion>temporal part of the subiculum</BrainRegion>(SUB) . Field potentials evoked by <BrainRegion>subicular</BrainRegion> stimulation were measured in the <BrainRegion>entorhinal cortex</BrainRegion>(EC) ; the topographic distribution of the average evoked potentials(AEPs) was dependent on the place of stimulation along the <BrainRegion>subicular septotemporal axis</BrainRegion>. <BrainRegion>Septal subiculum</BrainRegion>(SUB) stimulation elicited the largest field potentials in the <BrainRegion>laterocaudal part of the entorhinal cortex</BrainRegion>(EC) whereas <BrainRegion>temporal subiculum</BrainRegion>(SUB) stimulation evoked maximal responses in the <BrainRegion>mediocaudal part of the entorhinal cortex</BrainRegion>(EC) . These findings indicate that a topographical organization exists in the <BrainRegion>entorhinal cortex</BrainRegion>(EC) - <BrainRegion>subiculum</BrainRegion>(SUB) connections and that these connections are reciprocal. Unit activity both orthodromically and antidromically elicited by <BrainRegion>subiculum</BrainRegion>(SUB) stimulation was recorded in the <BrainRegion>entorhinal cortex</BrainRegion>(EC) . Mean conduction velocities were estimated and found to vary around 1 m/second-1. The physiological evidence is discussed along with the anatomical data reported in the accompanying paper.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Segmental variation in the arborization of identified neurons in the leech central nervous system.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Mechanosensory and motor neurons in the central nervous system of the leech have been examined by intracellular injection of horseradish peroxidase and electrophysiological mapping of their peripheral fields to determine how the arborizations of homologous cells are influenced by their segmental position. The branching patterns of annulus erector (AE) motoneurons in ganglia near the head and tail were found to be more extensive than those of cells in midbody ganglia. As in midbody ganglia, the peripheral fields of annulus erector(AE) motoneurons in adjacent ganglia near the head and tail overlapped extensively, but the subfields innervated by individual branches of a single annulus erector(AE) motoneuron showed little or no overlap. No annulus erector(AE) motoneurons were found in the head ganglion or in the 20th and 21st free segmental ganglia. The branching pattern of touch-sensitive mechanosensory cells showed a similar segmental variation; touch cells in ganglia near the head and tail had more extensive arborizations than those in midbody ganglia. The rostrocaudal position along the cord at which the branching pattern changed from that characteristic of midbody ganglia to one with a more extensive arborization differed for different types of neurons. These findings demonstrate that a cell&apos;s pattern of arborization is not determined by a simple segmental difference between ganglia and suggest that during development neurons respond individually to cues that vary along the length of the cord.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Organisation of the <BrainRegion>cerebellar nucleus</BrainRegion> of the dogfish, Scyliorhinus canicula L.: a light microscopic, immunocytochemical, and ultrastructural study.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Elasmobranchs possess a well-developed <BrainRegion>cerebellum</BrainRegion> with an associated <BrainRegion>cerebellar nucleus</BrainRegion>. To determine whether the organization of this nucleus is comparable with that of the deep <BrainRegion>cerebellar nuclei</BrainRegion> of mammals, we studied the dogfish <BrainRegion>cerebellar nucleus</BrainRegion> with light microscopic methods (Nissl stain, Golgi method, reduced silver stain, NADPH-diaphorase histochemistry and immunocytochemistry) and with electron microscopy. We found the dogfish <BrainRegion>cerebellar nucleus</BrainRegion> to consist of about 1,050 large neurons, the ratio of Purkinje cells to <BrainRegion>cerebellar nucleus</BrainRegion> neurons being about 17:1. Immunocytochemistry showed large glutamatergic neurons in the main portions of the nucleus and small glutamate- and/or alpha-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-immunoreactive cells in the subventricular region of the nucleus. Large glutamatergic neurons corresponded to bipolar or triangular cells revealed by Golgi methods. Application of horseradish peroxidase to the <BrainRegion>cerebellar cortex</BrainRegion> produced the labelling of beaded fibres of Purkinje cells in the <BrainRegion>cerebellar nucleus</BrainRegion>. Unlike in mammals, glutamate- and/or alpha-aminobutyric acid(GABA) ergic innervation of the <BrainRegion>cerebellar nucleus</BrainRegion> was scare: Purkinje cell axon terminals in the <BrainRegion>cerebellar nucleus</BrainRegion> did not appear to be glutamate- and/or alpha-aminobutyric acid(GABA) -immunoreactive, most glutamate- and/or alpha-aminobutyric acid(GABA) ergic fibres being found in the subventricular neuropile. Some fibres immunoreactive to serotonin and somatostatin were also observed in the subventricular neuropile of the <BrainRegion>cerebellar nucleus</BrainRegion>. Three neuron types were distinguished with electron microscopy (types A to C). Type A cells were abundant and smooth-surfaced, and appeared to correspond to Golgi-impregnated neurons and large glutamate-immunoreactive cells. Type B neurons were scarce and possessed dendrites covered by sessile or stalked spines. Type C neurons were small cells located mainly in the medialmost region of the nucleus and corresponded to subventricular glutamate- and glutamate- and/or alpha-aminobutyric acid(GABA) -immunoreactive cells. Six types of synaptic bouton were observed (types I to VI). The most abundant (type I boutons) made symmetrical contacts and appeared to correspond to Purkinje cell axons. Type I boutons were the only type observed on perikarya and initial axon segments of type A cells. Type IV and type V boutons made complex glomerular-like asymmetrical contacts with spines of type B cells. Type VI boutons appeared to correspond to peptidergic and/or monoaminergic axons. The functional significance of these results is discussed.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Connections of the small bipolar cells with the photoreceptors in the turtle. An electron microscope study of Golgi-impregnated, gold-toned <BrainRegion>retinas</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The connections between photoreceptors and the small bipolar cells with a Landolt club in the turtle <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> (Pseudemys scripta elegans) were analyzed with the electron microscope after Golgi impregnation and gold toning. The dendritic tree of several bipolars was partially or completely reconstructed from continuous series of thin sections. All bipolar cells studied established both basal and invaginating junctions with cone pedicles; in invaginating junctions, their dendrites invariably ended as the central process of triads. Dendrites of this bipolar cell type make invaginating synapses, basal junctions, or a mixture of both. In turn, each pedicle found within the dendritic field of the bipolar cell contacts it with a mixture of invaginating and basal junctions; furthermore, each pedicle synapses with more than one dendrite from the same bipolar cell. All small bipolar cells examined also synapse with rod pedicles; the geometry of the connections and the types of synapses are the same for both rods and cones. The fact that small turtle bipolars can form both basal and invaginating contacts with a single cone indicates that the polarity of the postsynaptic response can not be predicted on the basis of the structure of the photoreceptor-to-bipolar cell synapse.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Presynaptic cytomatrix protein bassoon is localized at both excitatory and inhibitory synapses of rat brain.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Bassoon is a 420-kDa protein specifically localized at the active zone of presynaptic nerve terminals. It is thought to be involved in the structural organization of the neurotransmitter release site. We studied the distribution of Bassoon transcripts and protein in rat brain and assessed which types of presynaptic terminals contain the protein. As shown by in situ hybridization, Bassoon transcripts are widely distributed in the brain and occur primarily in excitatory neurons. In addition, examples of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic neurons expressing Bassoon are detected. At the light microscopic level, Bassoon immunoreactivity is found in synaptic neuropil regions throughout the brain, with the strongest expression in the <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>cerebellar cortex</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>. Immunoelectron microscopy showed that Bassoon immunoreactivity is found in both asymmetric type 1 and symmetric type 2 synapses. Immunopositive asymmetric synapses include mossy fiber boutons and various spine and shaft synapses in the <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion> and mossy fiber terminals and parallel fiber terminals in the <BrainRegion>cerebellum</BrainRegion>. Bassoon-containing symmetric synapses are observed, e.g., between basket and granule cells in the <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion>, between Golgi cells and granule cells, and between basket cells and Purkinje cells in the <BrainRegion>cerebellum</BrainRegion>. Within synaptic terminals, Bassoon appears highly concentrated at sites opposite to postsynaptic densities. In cultured <BrainRegion>hippocampal</BrainRegion> neurons, Bassoon was found to colocalize with gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) (A) and glutamate (GluR1) receptors. These data indicate that Bassoon is a component of the presynaptic apparatus of both excitatory glutamatergic and inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) ergic synapses.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Nigropedunculopontine projection in the rat: an anterograde tracing study with phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin (PHA-L).</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The termination of the <BrainRegion>substantia nigra pars reticulata</BrainRegion> efferents in the <BrainRegion>nucleus tegmenti pedunculopontinus</BrainRegion> was studied in the rat by using the anterograde tracer Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin (PHA-L). Both large and small injections of Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin(PHA-L) in various portions of the <BrainRegion>substantia nigra pars reticulata</BrainRegion> labeled varicose fibers in the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral and contralateral nucleus tegmenti pedunculopontinus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>subnucleus dissipatus</BrainRegion> as well as in the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral nucleus tegmenti pedunculopontinus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>subnucleus compactus</BrainRegion>. However, the bulk of the <BrainRegion>nigral</BrainRegion> fibers appeared to terminate in the <BrainRegion>medial two-thirds of the ipsilateral subnucleus dissipatus of the pedunculopontine nucleus</BrainRegion> and exhibited a discrete dorsoventral topographical pattern. The terminal plexus displayed patches of uneven density, which was partly due to the numerous fiber bundles passing through the <BrainRegion>pedunculopontine nucleus</BrainRegion>, but also to an obvious preference of <BrainRegion>nigral</BrainRegion> fibers for some cells. Electron microscopic examination confirmed that nearly all of the varicosities observed in the light microscope contained synaptic vesicles and represented either terminal boutons or boutons en passant. The labeled boutons were elongated (average length: 1.5 microns) and consistently contained a prominent group of mitochondria. The results suggest that the <BrainRegion>nigral</BrainRegion> input to the <BrainRegion>nucleus tegmenti pedunculopontinus</BrainRegion> may be directed toward specific subpopulation(s) of <BrainRegion>pedunculopontine</BrainRegion> neurons and may influence not only cells in the <BrainRegion>subnucleus dissipatus</BrainRegion>, but also in the <BrainRegion>subnucleus compactus</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Cell division and cleavage orientation in the developing <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> are regulated by L-DOPA.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Recent studies have highlighted a potential link between the cleavage orientation of a dividing neuroblast and the regulation of daughter cell fate in the developing vertebrate <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>. There is evidence to suggest that this process is at least partially regulated by the presence of the <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> pigment epithelium (RPE) and/or <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> pigment epithelium(RPE) -derived factors. In addition to a lack of melanin in the <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> pigment epithelium(RPE) , the albino <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> is characterized by abnormal patterns of cell proliferation and cellular organization during development as well as cell-type specific deficits in the adult. We examined mitotic spindle orientation in vivo in developing pigmented and albino rat <BrainRegion>retinae</BrainRegion> along with other parameters of cell division to determine whether <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> pigment epithelium(RPE) abnormalities in the albino influence these aspects of <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> development. In the albino, mitotic indices were elevated, an excess of cells remained in the cell cycle, dividing cells were not so tightly apposed to the ventricular margin, and an excessive proportion of divisions was vertically oriented (i.e., with the mitotic spindle aligned perpendicular to the plane of the neuroepithelium). Administration of L-DOPA (a melanin precursor found at reduced concentrations in the hypopigmented eye) regulated the distribution of spindle orientations and reduced levels of mitosis in a manner consistent with an endogenous role in the control of these processes. These findings highlight the multiple roles that L-DOPA plays in the regulation of <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> development and cast light on the diversity of anatomical abnormalities found in the albino visual system.

<ArticleTitle>Ultrastructure of the Eimer&apos;s organ of the star-nosed mole.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The nose of the star-nosed mole consists of 22 fleshy appendages that fan out from around the nostrils and are covered with specialized epidermal sensory receptors called Eimer&apos;s organs. The Eimer's organs of the star-nosed mole are domed epidermal papillae approximately 40 to 50 microns in diameter. The center of each papilla contains a column of stacked circular epidermal cells closely associated with five to ten neural processes that originate from three myelinated fibers in the underlying dermis. At middle and lower levels in the cell column, a single nerve fiber is located in the center of the column, enclosed by the epidermal cells which wrap around the fiber and form desmosomes between their own adjacent plasma membranes. An additional five to ten fibers travel up the sides of the column ensheathed in the margins of the epidermal cells. At the top of the cell column, the nerve fibers produce a repeated series of terminal swellings. These terminal swellings converge in the center of the column, where a single epidermal cell completely encapsulates each circular arrangement of nerve terminals. No synapses or other cellular junctions were observed between the nerve terminals where they converge within the cell column. There is a single Merkel-like ending at the base of the cell column, and a single encapsulated corpuscle beneath the cell column, in the connective tissue of the dermis. The structure of Eimer's organs is consistent with a mechanoreceptive function.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Ontogeny of the projections from the <BrainRegion>anteroventral periventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus</BrainRegion> in the female rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Neurons in the <BrainRegion>anteroventral periventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus</BrainRegion> (AVPV) mediate a variety of autonomic functions. In adults they primarily innervate <BrainRegion>neuroendocrine nuclei in the periventricular zone of the hypothalamus</BrainRegion>, including the <BrainRegion>paraventricular and arcuate nuclei</BrainRegion> (PVH, ARH). Ascending projections from the <BrainRegion>anteroventral periventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus</BrainRegion>(AVPV) also provide inputs to the <BrainRegion>ventrolateral septum</BrainRegion> (LSv) and the principal division of the <BrainRegion>bed nuclei of the stria terminalis</BrainRegion> (BSTp). Consistent with a role in regulating preovulatory luteinizing hormone secretion, rostral projections from the <BrainRegion>anteroventral periventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus</BrainRegion>(AVPV) contact gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons surrounding the <BrainRegion>vascular organ of the lamina terminalis</BrainRegion> (OVLT). To study the development of these pathways, we placed implants of the lipophilic tracers DiI and CMDiI into the <BrainRegion>anteroventral periventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus</BrainRegion>(AVPV) of female rats ranging in age from embryonic day 19 (E19) through adulthood. The earliest projections targeted a population of gonadotropin-releasing hormone(GnRH) neurons, with apparent contacts from labeled fibers observed as early as embryonic day 19(E19) . These connections appeared to be fully developed before birth, as similar numbers of appositions from <BrainRegion>anteroventral periventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus</BrainRegion>(AVPV) projections onto the gonadotropin-releasing hormone(GnRH) -immunoreactive cells were observed at all ages examined. Caudal projections were delayed relative to projections to the <BrainRegion>OVLT</BrainRegion>. Labeled <BrainRegion>anteroventral periventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus</BrainRegion>(AVPV) fibers reached the <BrainRegion>PVH</BrainRegion> during the first postnatal week, and fibers targeting the <BrainRegion>BSTp</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>LSv</BrainRegion> were not observed until the second and third postnatal weeks, respectively. Labeled <BrainRegion>anteroventral periventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus</BrainRegion>(AVPV) fibers were not seen in the <BrainRegion>ARH</BrainRegion> of animals at any age. Our results demonstrate that projections from the <BrainRegion>anteroventral periventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus</BrainRegion>(AVPV) develop with both spatial and temporal specificity, innervating each target with a unique developmental profile.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Intergeniculate leaflet</BrainRegion>: an anatomically and functionally distinct subdivision of the <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate complex</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The <BrainRegion>intergeniculate leaflet</BrainRegion> (IGL) in the rat is a distinctive subdivision of the <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate complex</BrainRegion> that participates in the regulation of circadian function through its projections to the circadian pacemaker, the <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion> (SCN) of the <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion>. The present investigation was undertaken to provide a precise definition of the <BrainRegion>intergeniculate leaflet</BrainRegion>(IGL) and a characterization of its neuronal organization including neuronal morphology, chemical phenotype, connections, and synaptic organization. The <BrainRegion>intergeniculate leaflet</BrainRegion>(IGL) extends the entire <BrainRegion>rostrocaudal length of the geniculate complex</BrainRegion> and contains a distinct population of small to medium neurons. In Golgi preparations, the neurons are multipolar with dendrites largely confined to the <BrainRegion>intergeniculate leaflet</BrainRegion>(IGL) . The neurons can be subdivided into three groups on the basis of neurotransmitter content and projections: (1) neurons that contain GABA and neuropeptide Y and project to the <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion>(SCN) ; (2) neurons that contain GABA and enkephalin and project to the <BrainRegion>contralateral intergeniculate leaflet</BrainRegion>(IGL) ; and (3) a small group of neurons that projects to the <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion>(SCN) but not characterized as yet by neurotransmitter content. The <BrainRegion>intergeniculate leaflet</BrainRegion>(IGL) receives dense, bilateral input from <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> ganglion cells and dense substance P input of unknown origin. A number of neurons in the <BrainRegion>anterior hypothalamic area</BrainRegion> and, particularly, the <BrainRegion>retrochiasmatic area</BrainRegion> project to the <BrainRegion>intergeniculate leaflet</BrainRegion>(IGL) , and there are sparse projections from <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion> monoamine and cholinergic neurons. The synaptic organization of the <BrainRegion>intergeniculate leaflet</BrainRegion>(IGL) is complex with afferents terminating in glomerular complexes that include axoaxonic synaptic interactions. Virtually all <BrainRegion>intergeniculate leaflet</BrainRegion>(IGL) afferents synapse upon dendrites and spines, with the densest synaptic input occurring on the distal portions of the dendritic arbor. The organization of the <BrainRegion>intergeniculate leaflet</BrainRegion>(IGL) and its connections as revealed in this analysis is in accord with its role in the integration of visual input with other information to provide feedback regulation of the <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion>(SCN) pacemaker.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Functional morphologies of <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> ganglion cells in the turtle.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText><BrainRegion>Retinal</BrainRegion> ganglion cells in the turtle, Pseudemys scripta elegans, were examined by intracellular recording with a protocol of stationary and moving lights. Responses were apportioned among OFF, ON, and ON-OFF categories, and directional selectivity. Cells were injected with Neurobiotin, then later conjugated with avidin-horseradish peroxidase in standard procedure. Morphological analysis of the stained cells included measurements of soma and dendritic field sizes, dendritic stratification, number of cell processes, dendritic branchings, and dendritic symmetry ratios. ON and ON-OFF cells are at least bistratified, sometimes tristratified, in both sublaminae A and B whether directionally selective or not. OFF cells, in contrast, are monostratified, or at least confined to sublamina A. Morphological parameters of somal and dendritic field areas, branch point densities, and dendritic field asymmetries do not predict directional selectivity. Membrane polarization accompanying moving stimulation is discussed in terms of shunting inhibition and recording site.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>&quot;Necklace olfactory glomeruli" form unique components of the rat primary olfactory system.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>A distinct subset of rat <BrainRegion>primary olfactory</BrainRegion> neurons was identified immunohistochemically by means of a polyclonal antibody against human placental antigen X-P2 (hPAX-P2), an incompletely characterized substance found in all estrogen-biosynthetic organs. The subset of olfactory receptor cells was distributed widely over the olfactory epithelium with some degree of concentration on the dorsocaudal walls of <BrainRegion>nasal subcavities</BrainRegion>. The subset formed unique &quot;necklace olfactory glomeruli," which were composed of seven to nine solitary glomeruli located in the caudal end of the <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>. One of them was located in the &quot;<BrainRegion>modified glomerular complex</BrainRegion>&quot; reported to be involved in rat suckling behavior. The projectional patterns of the necklace olfactory system, albeit diffuse, indicated some degree of spatial correspondence between zones of olfactory epithelium and specific glomeruli. Axons emanating from neighboring cells can project to several glomerular loci. From the necklace olfactory system, an average of 150-200 receptor cells were estimated to converge onto a single necklace glomerulus.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Organization of <BrainRegion>subcortical</BrainRegion> pathways for sensory projections to the <BrainRegion>limbic cortex</BrainRegion>. I. <BrainRegion>Subcortical</BrainRegion> projections to the <BrainRegion>medial limbic cortex</BrainRegion> in the rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText><BrainRegion>Subcortical</BrainRegion> afferent projections to the <BrainRegion>medial limbic cortex</BrainRegion> were examined in the rat by the use of retrograde axonal transport of horseradish peroxidase. Small iontophoretic injections of horseradish peroxidase were placed at various locations within the <BrainRegion>dorsal and ventral cingulate areas</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>dorsal agranular and ventral granular divisions of the retrosplenial cortex</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>presubiculum</BrainRegion>. Somata of afferent neurons in the <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>basal forebrain</BrainRegion> were identified by retrograde labeling. Each of the <BrainRegion>anterior thalamic nuclei</BrainRegion> was found to project to several <BrainRegion>limbic cortical areas</BrainRegion>, although not with equal density. The <BrainRegion>anterior dorsal nucleus</BrainRegion> projects primarily to the <BrainRegion>presubiculum</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>ventral retrosplenial cortex</BrainRegion>; the <BrainRegion>anterior ventral nucleus</BrainRegion> projects to the <BrainRegion>retrosplenial cortex</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>presubiculum</BrainRegion> with apparently similar densities; and the <BrainRegion>anterior medial nucleus</BrainRegion> projects primarily to the <BrainRegion>cingulate areas</BrainRegion>. The projections from the <BrainRegion>lateral dorsal nucleus</BrainRegion> to these <BrainRegion>limbic cortical areas</BrainRegion> are organized in a loose topographic fashion. The projection to the <BrainRegion>presubiculum</BrainRegion> originates in the most <BrainRegion>dorsal portion of the lateral dorsal nucleus</BrainRegion>. The projection to the <BrainRegion>ventral retrosplenial cortex</BrainRegion> originates in <BrainRegion>rostral and medial portions of the nucleus</BrainRegion>, whereas afferents to the <BrainRegion>dorsal retrosplenial cortex</BrainRegion> originate in <BrainRegion>caudal portions of the lateral dorsal nucleus</BrainRegion>. The projection to the <BrainRegion>cingulate</BrainRegion> originates in the <BrainRegion>ventral portion of the lateral dorsal nucleus</BrainRegion>. Other projections from the <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion> originate in the <BrainRegion>intralaminar and midline nuclei</BrainRegion>, including the <BrainRegion>central lateral, central dorsal, central medial, paracentral, reuniens, and paraventricular nuclei</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>ventral medial and ventral anterior nuclei</BrainRegion>. In addition, projections to the <BrainRegion>medial limbic cortex</BrainRegion> from the <BrainRegion>basal forebrain</BrainRegion> originate in cells of the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the diagonal band</BrainRegion>. Projections to the <BrainRegion>presubiculum</BrainRegion> also originate in the <BrainRegion>medial septum</BrainRegion>. These results are discussed in regard to convergence of sensory and nonsensory information projecting to the <BrainRegion>limbic cortex</BrainRegion> and the types of visual and other sensory information that may be relayed to the <BrainRegion>limbic cortex</BrainRegion> by these projections.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Origin and identification of fibers in the <BrainRegion>cranial nerve IX-X complex</BrainRegion> of Xenopus laevis: Lucifer Yellow backfills in vitro.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The central projections of individual components of the <BrainRegion>IX-X nerve complex</BrainRegion> in the South African clawed frog, Xenopus laevis, were mapped by dye diffusion with Lucifer Yellow in an isolated brain preparation. The method reliably revealed fiber tracts, termination zones, and detailed cell morphology. In addition, motor neurons could be doubly labelled by retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase from muscle targets followed by backfilling the appropriate nerves with Lucifer Yellow. The most anterior root associated with the <BrainRegion>nerve IX-X complex</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>root 1</BrainRegion>, is composed of lateral line afferents that terminate in the <BrainRegion>medial medulla</BrainRegion>. <BrainRegion>Root 2</BrainRegion> contains sensory fibers that terminate in the <BrainRegion>nucleus tractus solitarii</BrainRegion> and axons of lateral line efferent neurons. <BrainRegion>Root 3</BrainRegion> is composed of sensory and motor fibers, including a major somatosensory component that terminates in <BrainRegion>posterior medulla</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>anterior spinal cord</BrainRegion>, and axons from <BrainRegion>cranial nerve nucleus IX-X</BrainRegion>. The most posterior root of the <BrainRegion>IX-X nerve complex</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>root 4</BrainRegion>, contains axons of laryngeal motor neurons and of general visceral efferent neurons.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Effects of continuous light on the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> of a fish, Notemigonus crysoleucas.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Notemigonus crysoleucas organisms were exposed to light at 1,250 and 850 lux in regimes of 12L:12D and 24L:OD. Each layer of cells in the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> was evaluated employing light microscopy and measurements for quantitative analysis were recorded from the <BrainRegion>retinas</BrainRegion> of over 150 fish. These values were compared for <BrainRegion>dorsal and ventral portions of the retina</BrainRegion>, for the two intensities, and for the two regimes. Fish maintained under the 24L:OD light regime exhibited significant light damage to the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>, characterized by reduction of outer segments of photoreceptors, reduction in the density of nuclear layers, and disintegration of ganglion cells. The <BrainRegion>dorsal portion of the retina</BrainRegion> experienced significantly greater deterioration than the ventral portion. Fish which had been subjected to 96 hours of continuous light displayed no ability to repair damage after 96 hours under 12L:12D.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>The phylogenetic significance of crustacean <BrainRegion>optic neuropils</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>chiasmata</BrainRegion>: a re-examination.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Recent molecular data challenge the traditional hypotheses of arthropod phylogeny founded on morphologic characters. In this discussion, the structure of the visual systems in Pterygota (Hexapoda) and Decapoda (Malacostraca, Crustacea) is an important argument. Although many components of their visual systems depict structural homology, differences exist between Pterygota/Decapoda on the one side and Branchiopoda (Entomostraca) on the other in that the latter do not have a third optic neuropil or <BrainRegion>optic chiasmata</BrainRegion>. Therefore, the goals of the current study were to explore whether the <BrainRegion>third optic neuropils</BrainRegion> in Pterygota and Decapoda are homologous, to examine the formation of the <BrainRegion>first two optic neuropils and the chiasmata</BrainRegion> in Crustacea, and to compare these processes with Pterygota. For this purpose, five species of entomostracan and malacostracan crustaceans were analyzed by examination of serial sections, fluorescence labeling with phallotoxins, and anti-histamine immunohistochemistry. We found that the <BrainRegion>chiasmata</BrainRegion> of Decapoda and Pterygota are characterized by striking similarities regarding both the level of individually identifiable classes of neurons and ontogenetic mechanisms, which are clearly different from those in Branchiopoda. Furthermore, the <BrainRegion>third optic neuropil</BrainRegion> of Decapoda and Pterygota, the lobula, shares an ontogenetic protocerebral origin and an innervation by corresponding sets of histamine-immunoreactive neurons, suggesting homology of the lobula in these two groups. In conclusion, the characteristics of the visual system are in conflict with the traditional classification of Arthropoda. Instead, they support a sister-group relationship of Hexapoda and Malacostraca, as suggested by some of the molecular studies.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Complementary stripes of phospholipase Cbeta3 and Cbeta4 expression by Purkinje cell subsets in the mouse <BrainRegion>cerebellum</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Transverse boundaries divide the <BrainRegion>cerebellar cortex</BrainRegion> into four transverse zones, and within each zone the <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion> is further subdivided into a symmetrical array of parasagittal stripes. Several molecules believed to mediate long-term depression at the parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapse are known to be expressed in stripes. We have therefore explored the distributions of phospholipase Cbeta3 and phospholipase Cbeta4, key components in the transduction of type 1 metabotropic glutamate receptor-mediated responses. The data reveal that both phospholipase Cbeta isotypes are expressed strongly in the mouse <BrainRegion>cerebellum</BrainRegion> in subsets of Purkinje cells. The two distributions are distinct and largely nonoverlapping. The pattern of phospholipase Cbeta3 expression is unique, revealing stripes in three of the four transverse zones and a uniform distribution in the fourth. In contrast, phospholipase Cbeta4 appears to be confined largely to the Purkinje cells that are phospholipase Cbeta3-negative. PLCbeta3 is restricted to the zebrin II-immunopositive Purkinje cell subset. Not all zebrin II-immunoreactive Purkinje cells express PLCbeta3: in lobules IX and X it is restricted to that zebrin II-immunopositive subset that also expresses the small heat shock protein HSP25. PLCbeta4 expression is restricted to, and coextensive with, the zebrin II-immunonegative Purkinje cell subset. These nonoverlapping expression patterns suggest that long-term depression may be manifested differently between <BrainRegion>cerebellar</BrainRegion> modules.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Topographic intermingling of striatonigral and striatopallidal neurons in the rhesus monkey.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The topography and interrelationship of striatofugal neurons have been examined using a double retrograde tracing paradigm to label striatopallidal and striatonigral neurons in the same <BrainRegion>neostriatum</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>rostral globus pallidus</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>rostral substantia nigra</BrainRegion> in the same hemisphere were injected simultaneously with fluorescent tracers in three monkeys. In addition, the <BrainRegion>caudal globus pallidus</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>caudal substantia nigra</BrainRegion> were injected separately in a fourth and fifth monkey with a fluorescent dye and wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP), respectively. Digitized plots of fluorescent dye-labeled neurons revealed that large numbers of striatonigral projection neurons lie within both <BrainRegion>neostriatal nuclei</BrainRegion>, i.e., the <BrainRegion>caudate</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>putamen</BrainRegion>. Similarly, neurons innervating the <BrainRegion>globus pallidus</BrainRegion> were found in both <BrainRegion>caudate</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>putamen</BrainRegion>. The distribution of retrogradely labeled neurons observed was consistent with the topography of striatofugal projections that has been described previously, i.e., the <BrainRegion>rostrocaudal and mediolateral axes of the neostriatum</BrainRegion> are preserved in the striatopallidal and striatonigral projections (e.g., Szabo, &apos;62, '67, '70, '72) and the dorsoventral axis is inverted in the projection of the <BrainRegion>neostriatum</BrainRegion> onto the <BrainRegion>nigra</BrainRegion> but not in the striatopallidal projection (Nauta and Domesick, &apos;79; Gerfen, '85). Analysis of cases in which striatonigral and striatopallidal neurons were present in large numbers within the same region of the <BrainRegion>neostriatum</BrainRegion> disclosed that the two populations are intermingled such that small clusters of striatopallidal neurons are surrounded by striatonigral neurons and vice versa. The clustered arrangement of striatofugal neurons observed in the fluorescent cases was unambiguous in a case in which HRP was injected into the <BrainRegion>caudal substantia nigra</BrainRegion>. In this case, both anterogradely labeled terminals and retrogradely labeled neurons exhibited a striking, compartmental-like distribution in the <BrainRegion>posterior putamen</BrainRegion>. Our observations indicate that the matrix compartment of the <BrainRegion>neostriatum</BrainRegion> is comprised of a patchwork of interposed clusters of <BrainRegion>nigral</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>pallidal</BrainRegion> efferent neurons. We hypothesize that these clusters of efferent neurons may direct interdigitated <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> inputs into distinct nigro- and pallido-thalamic pathways. In view of the parallel nature of processing throughout the <BrainRegion>basal ganglia</BrainRegion>, it appears that convergence of these segregated nigral and pallidal loops must occur at the <BrainRegion>cortical level</BrainRegion> where prefrontal and premotor targets of the <BrainRegion>basal ganglia</BrainRegion> are interconnected via corticocortical projections (Selemon and Goldman-Rakic, &apos;88).</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Characterization of neuropeptide Y-expressing cells in the mouse <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> using immunohistochemical and transgenic techniques.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The amacrine cells of the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> are a complex family of interneurons. They are made up of numerous subgroups, each with different morphologic and/or biochemical properties and each presumably serving a different function. In this study, we characterized one subgroup, defined by its expression of a peptide, neuropeptide Y (NPY). The cells were identified using antibodies to neuropeptide Y(NPY) and characterized using a transgenic mouse line that expressed the reporter enzyme, beta-galactosidase, in the neuropeptide Y(NPY) -immunoreactive ( neuropeptide Y(NPY) -IR) cells. We found that neuropeptide Y(NPY) -IR cells were present in two layers, the inner nuclear layer (INL) and the ganglion cell layer (GCL). The cells in both layers were densely distributed, with those in the inner nuclear layer(INL) having a mean density of 1452 +/- 65 cells/mm(2), and those in the ganglion cell layer(GCL) having a mean density of 644 +/- 41 cells/mm(2). The cells in the inner nuclear layer(INL) extended their processes in the sublamina of the inner plexiform layer (IPL) closest to the inner nuclear layer(INL) / inner plexiform layer(IPL) border, the presumptive OFF sublamina, and the cells in the ganglion cell layer(GCL) extended their processes in the sublamina near the ganglion cell layer(GCL) / inner plexiform layer(IPL) border, the presumptive ON sublamina. Both populations of cells were immunoreactive to a GABA transporter and, thus, likely GABAergic. The high density of these cells suggests that they play a prominent role in inner plexiform layer(IPL) processing. The location of their processes suggests that one population acts in the pathway that mediates OFF responses, and the other in the pathway that mediates ON responses, and their expression of a GABA marker indicates that their actions are likely inhibitory.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Enriched expression and developmental regulation of the middle-weight neurofilament (NF-M) gene in <BrainRegion>song control nuclei</BrainRegion> of the zebra finch.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Songbirds evolved a complex set of <BrainRegion>dimorphic telencephalic nuclei</BrainRegion> that are essential for the learning and production of song. These nuclei, which together make up the oscine song control system, present several neurochemical properties that distinguish them from the rest of the <BrainRegion>telencephalon</BrainRegion>. Here we show that the expression of the gene encoding the middle-weight neurofilament (NF-M), an important component of the neuronal cytoskeleton and a useful tool for studying the cytarchitectonic organization of mammalian <BrainRegion>cortical areas</BrainRegion>, is highly enriched in large neurons within <BrainRegion>pallial song control nuclei</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>nucleus HVC</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>robustus nucleus of the arcopallium</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>lateral magnocellular nucleus of the nidopallium</BrainRegion>) of male zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata). We also show that this transcript is highly expressed in large neurons in the <BrainRegion>medulla</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>pons</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>midbrain</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion>. Moreover, we demonstrate that neurofilament(NF-M) expression in <BrainRegion>song control nuclei</BrainRegion> changes during postembryonic development, peaking during an early phase of the song-learning period that coincides with the maturation of the song system. We did not observe changes in neurofilament(NF-M) expression in <BrainRegion>auditory areas</BrainRegion> or in <BrainRegion>song control nuclei</BrainRegion> in the contexts of hearing song or singing, although these contexts result in marked induction of the transcription factor ZENK. This observation suggests that neurofilament(NF-M) might not be under the regulatory control of ZENK in <BrainRegion>auditory areas</BrainRegion> or in <BrainRegion>song control nuclei</BrainRegion>. Overall, our data indicate that neurofilament(NF-M) is a neurochemical marker for <BrainRegion>pallial song control nuclei</BrainRegion> and provide suggestive evidence of an involvement of neurofilament(NF-M) in the development and/or maturation of the oscine song control system.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Immunocytochemical localization of sGnRH and cGnRH-II in the brain of goldfish, Carassius auratus.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The immunocytochemical distribution of salmon gonadotropin-releasing hormone (sGnRH) and chicken GnRH-II (cGnRH-II) neurons in the brain of goldfish was examined using respective antisera. Salmon GnRH-immunoreactive (ir) cell bodies were localized in the area between the <BrainRegion>olfactory nerve</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> (the terminal nerve ganglion), the <BrainRegion>ventral telencephalon</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>preoptic area</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion>. Chicken GnRH-II- GnRH-immunoreactive(ir) cell bodies were observed in the same areas as were those of salmon gonadotropin-releasing hormone(sGnRH) , although the number of cell bodies were fewer than those of salmon gonadotropin-releasing hormone(sGnRH) . In addition, chicken GnRH-II- GnRH-immunoreactive(ir) cell bodies were also observed in the midbrain <BrainRegion>tegmentum</BrainRegion> where no salmon gonadotropin-releasing hormone(sGnRH) - GnRH-immunoreactive(ir) cell bodies were found. Both salmon gonadotropin-releasing hormone(sGnRH) - GnRH-immunoreactive(ir) and chicken GnRH-II(cGnRH-II) - GnRH-immunoreactive(ir) fibers were distributed not only in the <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>pituitary gland</BrainRegion> but also in various brain areas from the <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>. The wide distribution of GnRH- GnRH-immunoreactive(ir) fibers suggests that in the goldfish, salmon gonadotropin-releasing hormone(sGnRH) and chicken GnRH-II(cGnRH-II) not only regulate gonadotropin release from the <BrainRegion>pituitary gland</BrainRegion> but also function as neuromodulators in various brain regions.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Postnatal development of periodontal ruffini endings in rat incisors: an immunoelectron microscopic study using protein gene product 9.5 (PGP 9.5) antibody.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Postnatal development of Ruffini endings was ultrastructurally investigated in the upper incisors of the rat from 1 day to 60 days after birth by means of protein gene product 9.5 (PGP 9.5) immunocytochemistry. The immunostaining with protein gene product 9.5(PGP 9.5) antibody clearly demonstrated chronological alterations of the distribution and ultrastructure of the Ruffini endings during postnatal development. At 1 day after birth, the protein gene product 9.5(PGP 9.5) -positive nerve terminals contained a few mitochondria and vesicles immunonegative for protein gene product 9.5(PGP 9.5) . Dendritic terminals appeared at 4 days after birth, with a small number of expanded or bulbous portions. These expanded portions possessed morphological features similar to those of the growth cone: several mitochondria and various kinds of vesicles. Typical Ruffini endings with dendritic ramification and expanded portions appeared 7-11 days after birth. At this stage, parts of the axon terminals extended through the slits of Schwann cell covering and formed finger-like projections called axonal spines. These Ruffini endings increased dramatically in number after 24-26 days and were identical in density and morphology to those seen in adult rats. After the commencement of the occlusion between the incisors, the number of large mitochondria increased, in contrast to the decrease of the vesicles in the axon terminals. Moreover, the axonal spines increased both in number and in length. Thus, the periodontal nerve endings showed stage-specific morphological features intimately related in timing to tooth eruption and occlusion. Functional stimuli possibly contribute to the final differentiation and maturation of the periodontal Ruffini endings.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Enhanced fos expression in the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) brain following first courtship.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Young zebra finch males that court a female for the first time develop a stable preference for the females of that species. On the neuronal level, consolidation of the imprinted information takes place. Here we demonstrate that first courtship or being chased around in the cage leads to enhanced fos expression in <BrainRegion>forebrain areas</BrainRegion> implicated in learning and imprinting in zebra finch males compared with birds reared in isolation or in the aviary. Two of the <BrainRegion>forebrain areas</BrainRegion> highly active during first courtship (as demonstrated by the 14C-2-deoxyglucose technique), the imprinting locus <BrainRegion>latral neo/hyperstriatum ventrale</BrainRegion> (LNH) and the <BrainRegion>secondary visual area hyperstriatum accessorium/dorsale</BrainRegion> (HAD), demonstrate enhanced fos expression. Two other imprinting-related areas, the <BrainRegion>medial neo/hyperstriatum ventrale</BrainRegion> (MNH) and <BrainRegion>archistriatum/neostriatum caudale</BrainRegion> (ANC), do show c-fos induction; however, the areas are not congruous with those demarcated by the 2-DG autoradiographic studies. Additional <BrainRegion>telencephalic areas</BrainRegion> include the <BrainRegion>olfactory lobe</BrainRegion>, the information storage site <BrainRegion>lobus parolfactorius</BrainRegion> (LPO), the memory site <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>auditory caudomedial neostriatum</BrainRegion> implicated in the strength of song learning, and the <BrainRegion>caudolateral neostriatum</BrainRegion>, which is comparable to the mammalian <BrainRegion>prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion>. In addition, c-fos is induced by first courtship and chasing in neurosecretory cell groups of the <BrainRegion>preoptic area</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion> associated with the repertoire of sexual behavior and stress or enhanced arousal. Enhanced fos expression is also observed in brainstem sources of specific (noradrenergic, catecholaminergic) and nonspecific (<BrainRegion>reticular formation</BrainRegion>) activating pathways with inputs to higher brain areas implicated in the imprinting process. Birds reared in isolation or alternatively in the aviary with social and sexual contact to conspecifics showed attenuated or no fos expression in most of the above-mentioned areas. First courtship and chasing both lead to enhanced uptake of 2-DG in the four imprinting areas, as well as subsequent changes in spine density-an anatomical manifestation of the imprinting process. fos expression in the imprinting and other <BrainRegion>telencephalic</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>preoptic</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>hypothalamic</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>mesencephalic brain regions</BrainRegion> indicates processing of stimuli originating from exposure (like chasing) and the analysis of stimuli in a behaviorally relevant, sexually explicit context (like first courtship). c-fos induction in these brain areas indicates its involvement in the triggering of neural changes that accompany the learning process of imprinting, leading eventually to alterations in dendritic spine density in the zebra finch.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>On the formation of neuromata in the <BrainRegion>primary olfactory</BrainRegion> projection.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Olfactory axons have been shown to grow aberrantly and form dense collections of axons, termed neuromas, in the olfactory epithelium of rats in which the <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> was ablated. Likewise, in human olfactory mucosa, collections of neurites have been noted in a variety of disease states, including Alzheimer&apos;s disease. We report here an immunohistochemical and electron microscopic analysis of aberrant axonal growth in the rat olfactory mucosa induced by experimental lesion. In particular, we have used the monoclonal antibody 2G12, which binds to the phosphorylated form of GAP-43, as an extremely sensitive marker for neuromatous axons, because it does not label neuronal cell bodies. In unilaterally bulbectomized rats, neuromas form in posterior olfactory epithelium on the operated side. Several lines of evidence, including serial section reconstruction, indicate that olfactory axons are induced to grow back into the epithelium at a distance from their point of origin as a consequence of bulbectomy, and are accompanied by glial cells from the <BrainRegion>olfactory nerve</BrainRegion>. Avulsion of a part of the <BrainRegion>olfactory nerve</BrainRegion> has similar effects as destruction of the <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>. Intraepithelial neuromas also develop in the olfactory mucosa of rats simultaneously exposed to methyl bromide gas and injected with 3-methyl indole; this treatment severely damages the olfactory epithelium directly. Exposure to methyl bromide alone causes milder damage, and the neuromas that form are transient. The evidence indicates that neuromas form after the epithelium is directly damaged because axons are trapped in the epithelium. Both of the mechanisms identified here should be taken into account when considering the findings in the human olfactory mucosa.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Galanin-immunoreactive synaptic terminals on <BrainRegion>basal forebrain</BrainRegion> cholinergic neurons in the rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Previous studies have indicated that galanin is one of the most abundant peptides in the <BrainRegion>basal forebrain</BrainRegion> and that it has a significant modulatory influence on cholinergic transmission. The aim of the present study was to use a light electron microscopic correlation technique to determine whether galanin-immunoreactive terminals form synaptic contacts with <BrainRegion>basal forebrain</BrainRegion> cholinergic cells of the rat. Sections from fixed-perfused brains were stained at the light and electron microscopic levels for galanin and choline acetyltransferase immunoreactivity in the same section by using a dual-colour immunohistochemical method. The results showed that galanin-immunoreactive axonal terminals are unevenly distributed in the <BrainRegion>medial septal nucleus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>diagonal band</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>nucleus basalis</BrainRegion>. Galanin-positive synapses were most prominent on choline acetyltransferase-positive neurons in the <BrainRegion>lateral parts of the nucleus of the diagonal band</BrainRegion> and in the <BrainRegion>posterior half of the nucleus basalis</BrainRegion>, which is where there was the greatest overlap between the distribution of galanin-immunoreactive terminals and choline acetyltransferase-positive neurons. The origins of these galanin-positive terminals are not known, but the results confirm that the <BrainRegion>basal forebrain</BrainRegion> galaninergic system has a synaptic influence on <BrainRegion>basal forebrain</BrainRegion> cholinergic neurons in the rat.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Postnatal increase of unmyelinated axon profiles in the feline <BrainRegion>ventral root L7</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The proportion of unmyelinated axon profiles and possible age-related, degenerative and regenerative alterations were studied ultrastructurally in the <BrainRegion>L7 ventral root</BrainRegion> of 25 cats ranging form 3 weeks to 11 years of age. For comparison, the <BrainRegion>ventral root C6</BrainRegion> was examined in 5 of these animals. The sections were taken from a level midway between the proximal and distal ends of the roots. The proportion of unmyelinated axon profiles in the <BrainRegion>L7 ventral root</BrainRegion> increased from about 14% to around 31% between 4 and 7 months after birth. Simultaneously, the average number of unmyelinated axon profiles per Schwann cell was doubled from 2-3 to 4-5. Thereafter, these figures remained largely unchanged for at least a decade. The total number of myelinated axons was similar in kittens and in cats. In the <BrainRegion>C6 root</BrainRegion> the proportion of unmyelinated axon profiles was about 20%, both in kittens and in young or old adult cats. At both segmental levels in the oldest cats, some unmyelinated axons showed degenerative changes and medium-sized and large axons had features characteristic of demyelination and remyelination.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Dopaminergic cell group A8 in the monkey: anatomical organization and projections to the <BrainRegion>striatum</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The first part of the study was a quantitative analysis of the distribution of A8 neurons compared with that of A9 and A10 neurons by means of tyrosine hydroxylase and calbindin-D(28K) immunohistochemistry and image analysis in monkeys. Then the <BrainRegion>striatal</BrainRegion> projection of A8 neurons was studied using retrograde and anterograde tracing methods. It was compared with that originating in cell groups A9 and A10 by performing injections of the retrograde tracer wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase into different regions of the <BrainRegion>striatum</BrainRegion>. Ten percent of all <BrainRegion>mesencephalic</BrainRegion> dopaminergic neurons are located in cell group A8. This cell group, along with A10 and the dorsal part of A9, constitutes the dorsal tier, which accounts for 28% of <BrainRegion>mesencephalic</BrainRegion> dopaminergic neurons. Double-staining experiments showed that the neurons located in the dorsal tier were calbindin positive, whereas those from the ventral tier were not. In terms of anatomical projection, the dorsal tier mainly projects to the <BrainRegion>ventral part of the associative striatum</BrainRegion>, with preferential projections of A8 neurons to the <BrainRegion>ventrocaudal putamen</BrainRegion>, of A10 neurons to the <BrainRegion>nucleus accumbens</BrainRegion>, and of dorsal A9 neurons to both. Conversely, the main targets of the ventral tier of <BrainRegion>mesencephalic</BrainRegion> neurons (ventral part of A9) are the <BrainRegion>sensorimotor putamen</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>associative caudate nucleus</BrainRegion>. In conclusion, each <BrainRegion>mesencephalic</BrainRegion> cell group projects primarily to one specific <BrainRegion>striatal region</BrainRegion> but also participates, albeit to a lesser extent, in the innervation of all the remaining <BrainRegion>striatal</BrainRegion> parts.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Origin of the vertebrate visual cycle: genes encoding <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> photoisomerase and two putative visual cycle proteins are expressed in whole brain of a primitive chordate.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The absorption of light by rhodopsin leads to the cis-to-trans isomerization of the chromophore to generate all-trans-retinal. In the visual cycle, the resultant all-trans-retinal is converted back into the 11-cis-retinal. In the mammalian eye, the <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> pigment epithelium (RPE) plays an essential role in the visual cycle. We have identified cDNA clones encoding three putative visual cycle proteins, homologs of mammalian retinal G-protein-coupled receptor (RGR), cellular retinaldehyde-binding protein (CRALBP) and beta-carotene 15,15&apos;-monooxygenase (BCO)/ <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> pigment epithelium(RPE) 65 in a primitive chordate, ascidian Ciona intestinalis. The mRNAs for these proteins are specifically expressed in the central nervous system during embryonic development. In the larva, the transcripts were widely distributed in the brain vesicle and visceral ganglion. Since visual pigment, Ci-opsin1, is solely expressed in photoreceptor cells, the visual cycle in this primitive chordate may take place in two compartments, which are coupled into a cycle by the direct flow of retinoids though the intercellular matrix. The Ci-opsin3, an ascidian homolog of mammalian <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> G-protein-coupled receptor(RGR) , was expressed in HEK 293S cells and purified after binding of <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion>. The chromophore of Ci-opsin3 is in an all-trans-retinal and it is isomerized to an 11-cis-form upon absorption of light. Mammalian cellular retinaldehyde-binding protein(CRALBP) and beta-carotene 15,15&apos;-monooxygenase(BCO) / <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> pigment epithelium(RPE) 65 are believed to play critical roles in the process of reisomerization of all-trans-retinoid to 11-cis-retinoid in <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> pigment epithelium(RPE) . The present data suggest that isomerization of all-trans-retinoid to 11-cis-retinoid occurs in the brain vesicle and visceral ganglion of a primitive chordate.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Central distribution of efferent and afferent components of the pudendal nerve in macaque monkeys.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Central distribution of efferent and afferent components of the pudendal nerve was studied by the horseradish peroxidase (HRP) method in 13 macaque monkeys, i.e., in nine Japanese monkeys (Macaca fuscata), two rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta), and two crab-eating monkeys (Macaca fascicularis). The enzyme was applied to the central cut end of the pudendal nerve; then the monkeys were allowed to survive for 36 to 72 hr. Retrogradely labeled neuronal cell bodies of pudendal motoneurons constituted a slender longitudinal cell column in the ventral horn. The cell column extended from high or middle <BrainRegion>S1</BrainRegion> to high or middle <BrainRegion>S2</BrainRegion> in eight monkeys, from middle or low <BrainRegion>L7</BrainRegion> to high <BrainRegion>S2</BrainRegion> in four monkeys, and from high <BrainRegion>L7</BrainRegion> to middle S1 in a monkey. The cell column appeared to correspond to Onuf&apos;s X nucleus in man. No sex difference was recognized in the position of the cell column. The average number of horseradish peroxidase(HRP) -labeled pudendal motoneurons was larger in male than in female adult Japanese monkeys, whereas no sex difference was found in the average soma diameter of the pudendal motoneurons. Transganglionically labeled axons entered into the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> through the <BrainRegion>S1</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>S2 dorsal roots</BrainRegion> in 12 monkeys and through the <BrainRegion>L7</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>S1 dorsal roots</BrainRegion> in one monkey. Labeled axons were distributed ipsilaterally in laminae I-VI and X of the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> at the same and adjacent levels of entry of horseradish peroxidase(HRP) -labeled dorsal root fibers (from <BrainRegion>L7</BrainRegion> to <BrainRegion>S3</BrainRegion> in 12 monkeys and from <BrainRegion>L6</BrainRegion> to <BrainRegion>S3</BrainRegion> in one monkey).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Auditory receptor of the red-eared turtle: II. Afferent and efferent synapses and innervation patterns.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Innervation patterns in the auditory receptor of the red-eared turtle were reconstructed from serial ultrathin sections. Four locations were studied, including three on the <BrainRegion>basilar membrane</BrainRegion> and one on the <BrainRegion>basal limbus</BrainRegion>. In that area of the papilla located above the apical end of the <BrainRegion>basilar membrane</BrainRegion> most cells were innervated by single afferent fibers which, in turn, supplied as many as three cells. Although afferents in the midmembrane area of the papilla supplied fewer cells, the innervation pattern was similar in other respects to that in the apical area including an abundance of efferent synapses on afferents. In contrast, hair cells in the <BrainRegion>basal membrane area</BrainRegion> were contacted by two afferent fibers and had five times as many afferent synapses as observed previously. Here, each afferent made twice as many synapses as fibers in the previous two areas and supplied one or two hair cells but received no efferent synapses. In the <BrainRegion>basal limbus area</BrainRegion>, each hair cell was contacted by as many as eight afferents and each afferent supplied as many as seven hair cells. The significance of these innervation patterns is discussed in the light of structural information obtained from other vertebrate auditory receptors and in the light of available functional information derived from the turtle papilla.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Regional and laminar distribution of the dopamine and serotonin innervation in the macaque <BrainRegion>cerebral cortex</BrainRegion>: a radioautographic study.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The regional density and laminar distribution of dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) afferents were investigated in the <BrainRegion>cerebral cortex</BrainRegion> of cynomolgus monkeys using a radioautographic technique that is based on the high affinity uptake capacity of these aminergic neurons. Large vibratome sections, 50 micron thick, were incubated with [3H] dopamine(DA) (0.2 microM) and desipramine (5 microM) or with unlabeled norepinephrine (5 microM) and [3H] 5-HT (0.6 microM), which allowed for the specific labeling of the dopamine(DA) and 5-HT innervations, respectively. After fixation, these sections were dried, defatted, and radioautographed by dipping. Semiquantitative data on the dopamine(DA) innervation also were provided by counting [3H] dopamine(DA) -labeled axonal varicosities in radioautographs from 4-micron-thick sections of the slices obtained after epon embedding. The dopamine(DA) innervation was widespread and differed in density and laminar distribution in the <BrainRegion>agranular and granular cortices</BrainRegion>. dopamine(DA) afferents were densest in the <BrainRegion>anterior cingulate</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>area 24</BrainRegion>) and the <BrainRegion>motor areas</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>areas 4, 6</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>supplementary motor area</BrainRegion> [SMA]). In the latter they displayed a trilaminar pattern of distribution, predominating in layers I, IIIa, and V-VI, with characteristic cluster-like formations in layer IIIa, especially in the <BrainRegion>medial part of motor areas</BrainRegion>. In the <BrainRegion>granular prefrontal</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>areas 46, 9, 10, 11, 12</BrainRegion>), <BrainRegion>parietal</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>areas 1, 2, 3, 5, 7</BrainRegion>), <BrainRegion>temporal</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>areas 21, 22</BrainRegion>), and <BrainRegion>posterior cingulate</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>area 23</BrainRegion>) <BrainRegion>cortices</BrainRegion>, dopamine(DA) afferents were less dense and showed a bilaminar pattern of distribution, predominating in the depth of layer I and in layers V-VI; density in layers II, III, and IV was only 20% of that in layer I. The lowest density was in the <BrainRegion>visual cortex</BrainRegion>, particularly in <BrainRegion>area 17</BrainRegion>, where the dopamine(DA) afferents were almost restricted to layer I. The density of 5-HT innervation was generally greater than that of dopamine(DA) except in the <BrainRegion>motor areas</BrainRegion> and in the <BrainRegion>anterior cingulate cortex</BrainRegion>. Region-specific laminar patterns characterized (1) <BrainRegion>motor areas</BrainRegion> where a lower density in layer III contrasted with the clusters of dopamine(DA) axons in the same layer; (2) the <BrainRegion>primary visual cortex</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>area 17</BrainRegion>), where two bands of higher density in layers III-IV and layer V outlined a poorly innervated zone in layer IVc-beta; (3) the <BrainRegion>peristriate area 18</BrainRegion>, where the 5-HT network was relatively loose but with a denser band in layer III. Thus, dopamine(DA) innervation of the <BrainRegion>cerebral cortex</BrainRegion> displays major differences between rodents and primates, characterized by expanded cortical targets and by a highly differentiated laminar distribution.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Projections from the <BrainRegion>cerebellar interposed</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>dorsal column nuclei</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion> in the rat: a double anterograde labelling study.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>It is generally agreed that <BrainRegion>cerebellar</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>lemniscal</BrainRegion> pathways project to largely separate areas of the <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion> and influence different functional areas of the <BrainRegion>cerebral cortex</BrainRegion>. <BrainRegion>Cerebellar</BrainRegion> afferents arise from neurones in the deep <BrainRegion>cerebellar nuclei</BrainRegion> and terminate in the <BrainRegion>ventral lateral group of thalamic nuclei</BrainRegion> or the <BrainRegion>&quot;motor thalamus,"</BrainRegion> whereas <BrainRegion>lemniscal</BrainRegion> afferents arise from the <BrainRegion>dorsal column nuclei</BrainRegion> and terminate in the adjacent <BrainRegion>ventral posterior group of thalamic nuclei</BrainRegion> or <BrainRegion>&quot;sensory thalamus."</BrainRegion> However, it remains unclear whether or not these pathways converge onto <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> neurones in the border zone between <BrainRegion>motor and sensory thalamus</BrainRegion>. The aim of this study was to compare directly the locations of <BrainRegion>cerebellar interposed</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>dorsal column nuclei</BrainRegion> terminals in the rat <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion> by using a double anterograde labelling technique. Microinjections of dextran-tetramethylrhodamine and dextran-fluorescein were made into the <BrainRegion>interposed and dorsal column nuclei</BrainRegion>, and labelled terminals in the <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion> were examined in the same sections. The labelled <BrainRegion>cerebellar</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>lemniscal</BrainRegion> terminals were located in separate areas throughout most of the <BrainRegion>ventral lateral</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>ventral posterior lateral nuclei</BrainRegion>, and there was only a limited region around the rostral border between these nuclei where the two groups of terminals came in close proximity to each other. In this common projection zone, however, <BrainRegion>cerebellar</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>lemniscal</BrainRegion> terminals seldom intermingled, and they mostly occupied separate, discreet areas. The results show that <BrainRegion>cerebellar</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>lemniscal</BrainRegion> fibres do indeed project to the <BrainRegion>border zone between the sensory and cerebellar thalamic nuclei</BrainRegion>, but they show practically no overlap in this region and are likely to influence separate thalamic neurones.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Central organization of eighth nerve and mechanosensory lateral line systems in the <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion> of ictalurid catfish.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The octavolateral sensory systems in teleost fish comprise at least four distinct hair-cell sensory modalities which are processed separately within the CNS. Two of these modalities, the mechanosensory lateral line system and the eighth nerve auditory system, have been implicated in the animal&apos;s ability to detect and localize underwater vibrations. Distinct <BrainRegion>mechanosensory lateral line and auditory nuclei</BrainRegion> are present within the <BrainRegion>torus semicircularis</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>midbrain</BrainRegion> homologue of the <BrainRegion>inferior colliculus</BrainRegion>. The present study utilized horseradish peroxidase tracing techniques to delineate those areas of the <BrainRegion>lower brainstem</BrainRegion> which are involved in auditory as opposed to mechanosensory lateral line processes. The <BrainRegion>primary mechanosensory nucleus of the medulla</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>n. medialis</BrainRegion>, projects directly to the <BrainRegion>optic tectum</BrainRegion> and to the <BrainRegion>mechanosensory nucleus of the torus semicircularis</BrainRegion>. <BrainRegion>Nucleus medialis</BrainRegion> receives input from <BrainRegion>primary lateral line nerve fibers</BrainRegion> as well as from a number of sites within the CNS: <BrainRegion>n. praeeminentialis pars ventralis</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>eminentia granularis</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>lobus caudalis of the cerebellum</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>n. praeeminentialis</BrainRegion> itself receives a descending input from the <BrainRegion>mechanosensory nucleus of the torus semicircularis</BrainRegion>. These mechanosensory lateral line pathways are parallel to, but distinct from, those of the electrosensory lateral line system. Auditory signals reach the <BrainRegion>midbrain</BrainRegion> via an entirely separate route. The <BrainRegion>octaval nerve</BrainRegion> terminates in a column of five <BrainRegion>medullary nuclei</BrainRegion>. Of these, only the <BrainRegion>anterior and descending octaval nuclei</BrainRegion> maintain a direct but sparse projection to the <BrainRegion>auditory nucleus of the midbrain</BrainRegion>. The bulk of the auditory input to the <BrainRegion>midbrain</BrainRegion> involves a newly described <BrainRegion>medullary nucleus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>medial auditory nucleus of the medulla</BrainRegion>. This nucleus receives input from the <BrainRegion>descending octaval nucleus</BrainRegion> and projects bilaterally to the <BrainRegion>auditory nucleus of the torus semicircularis</BrainRegion>. It is suggested that the <BrainRegion>medial auditory nucleus of the medulla</BrainRegion> is homologous to portions of the <BrainRegion>superior olivary complex</BrainRegion> of other vertebrates.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>The growth of nerves in relation to the formation of premuscle cell masses in the developing chick forelimb.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>A description is given of the growth of segmental nerves 13 to 16 (SN13 to SN16) from the brachial myotomes into the ventral and dorsal premuscle cell masses of the chick forelimb. At stage 25 (Hamburger and Hamilton, &apos;51), segmental nerves have converged to form two nerve trunks which enter the ventral and dorsal premuscle cell masses. These nerves grow into the limb, parallel to its proximodistal axis. The nerve trunk in the ventral compartment, the brachialis longus inferior (bli n), grows on the brachial artery as far as the metacarpals. The nerve trunk in the dorsal compartment, the brachialis longus superior (bls n), grows on the precartilage adjacent to a dorsal premuscle density as far as the metacarpals. The brachialis longus inferior and superior nerve trunks give rise to a number of nerves during their growth to the metacarpals. Each of these nerves appears at the time of formation of a new premuscle cell density. At late stage 25, a posterior and ventral premuscle density forms in the middle of the stylopodium; posterior fascicles of the brachialis longus inferior(bli n) diverge at this level and grow toward this new density to form the ulnar nerve. By stage 26 a posterior and ventral premuscle density is prominent over the brachialis longus inferior(bli n) , at the junction of the stylopodium and the zeugopodium; ventral fascicles of the brachialis longus inferior(bli n) grow into this density to form the flexor digitorum profundus nerve. At this stage a posterior and dorsal premuscle density forms just beyond the junction of the stylopodium and zeugopodium. Posterior fascicles of the brachialis longus superior(bls n) diverge at this level and grow toward this density to form a nerve from which the extensor metacarpi ulnaris, extensor digitorum communis, and radialis laterialis nerves are destined to form. At stage 29 the premuscle cell masses of the autopodium have formed. The remaining nerve fascicles comprising the brachialis longus superior(bls n) (the radialis profundus nerve) grow into the autopodium and branch to innervate each of the dorsal premuscles. The remaining nerve fascicles comprising the brachialis longus inferior(bli n) (the middle nerve) grow into the autopodium and branch to innervate each of the ventral premuscles.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Morphology and distribution of serotoninergic and oculomotor internuclear neurons in the cat <BrainRegion>midbrain</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Serotoninergic fibers have been reported in both the <BrainRegion>abducens</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>facial nuclei</BrainRegion> of the cat. Furthermore, serotoninergic <BrainRegion>dorsal raphe</BrainRegion> and oculomotor internuclear neurons occupy similar locations in the <BrainRegion>periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion> overlying the <BrainRegion>oculomotor and trochlear motor nuclei</BrainRegion>. To resolve the issue of whether these two populations of neurons overlap, serotoninergic fibers were assayed in the <BrainRegion>abducens</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>facial nucleus</BrainRegion>; then the morphologies and distributions of identified serotoninergic neurons and oculomotor internuclear neurons were determined. Both the <BrainRegion>abducens and facial nuclei</BrainRegion> contained varicosities labelled with antibody to serotonin, but a much higher density of immunoreactive fibers was present in the latter, especially in its medial aspect. Distinct synaptic profiles labelled with antibodies to serotonin were observed in both nuclei. In both cases, terminal profiles contained numerous small, predominantly spheroidal, synaptic vesicles as well as a few, large, dense-core vesicles. These profiles made synaptic contacts onto dendritic and, in the <BrainRegion>facial nucleus</BrainRegion>, somatic profiles that occasionally displayed asymmetric, postsynaptic, membrane densifications. Following injection of horseradish peroxidase into either the <BrainRegion>abducens</BrainRegion> or <BrainRegion>facial nuclei</BrainRegion>, double-label immunohistochemical techniques demonstrated that the serotoninergic and oculomotor internuclear neurons form two distinct cell populations. The immunoreactive serotoninergic cells were distributed within the <BrainRegion>dorsal raphe nucleus</BrainRegion>, predominantly caudal to the retrogradely labelled oculomotor internuclear neurons. The latter were located in the <BrainRegion>oculomotor nucleus</BrainRegion> along its dorsal border and in the adjacent <BrainRegion>supraoculomotor area</BrainRegion>. Intracellular injection of horseradish peroxidase revealed that oculomotor internuclear neurons have multipolar somata with up to ten long, tapering dendrites that bifurcate approximately five times. Their dendritic fields were generally contained within the nucleus and adjacent <BrainRegion>supraoculomotor area</BrainRegion>. In contrast, putative serotoninergic neurons were often spindle-shaped and exhibited far fewer primary dendrites. Many of these long, narrow, sparsely branched dendrites crossed the midline and extended to the surface of the <BrainRegion>cerebral aqueduct</BrainRegion>. In the vicinity of the <BrainRegion>aqueduct</BrainRegion> they branched repeatedly to form a dendritic thicket. The axons of the intracellularly stained serotoninergic neurons emerged either from the somata or the end of a process with dendritic morphology, and in some cases they produced axon collaterals within the <BrainRegion>periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion>. Thus the oculomotor internuclear and serotoninergic populations differ in both distribution and morphology.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Distribution of protein phosphatases-1 alpha and -1 gamma 1 and the D(1) dopamine receptor in primate <BrainRegion>prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion>: Evidence for discrete populations of spines.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The function of G protein-coupled receptors depends on the availability of the appropriate signal transduction proteins in close proximity to the receptor. We have examined and quantified in primate <BrainRegion>prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion> the subcellular distribution of two isoforms of protein phosphatase-1 (PP1), phosphatase-1(PP1) alpha and phosphatase-1(PP1) gamma 1, which are components of the signal transduction pathway accessed by the D(1) dopamine receptor. Both phosphatase-1(PP1) alpha- and phosphatase-1(PP1) gamma 1-labeled puncta are seen in <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>basal ganglia</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion>. Viewed with the electron microscope, both phosphatase-1(PP1) isoforms are selectively localized to dendritic spines and are found in different percentages of spines; phosphatase-1(PP1) alpha is present in roughly 70% and phosphatase-1(PP1) gamma 1 in roughly 40% of dendritic spines. Our analysis indicates that three populations of spines are defined by the distribution of these phosphatase-1(PP1) isoforms: those that contain both phosphatase-1(PP1) alpha and phosphatase-1(PP1) gamma 1, those that contain only phosphatase-1(PP1) alpha and those that contain neither. The D(1) receptor is present in a subset of the population that contains both phosphatase-1(PP1) alpha and phosphatase-1(PP1) gamma 1. The nonhomogeneous distribution of signal transduction proteins in the spines and dendrites of <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> pyramidal cells may help to explain differences in the actions of receptors that nominally use the same signal-transduction pathway.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>First evidence of diversity in eutherian <BrainRegion>chiasmatic</BrainRegion> architecture: tree shrews, like marsupials, have spatially segregated crossed and uncrossed chiasmatic pathways.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>In the <BrainRegion>optic chiasm</BrainRegion> of mammals, axons either cross the midline to the opposite side of the brain or remain uncrossed. In the eutherian species studied to date, uncrossed axons in the <BrainRegion>caudal nerve</BrainRegion> are found in all regions. In the <BrainRegion>chiasm</BrainRegion>, they are dispersed through the <BrainRegion>hemichiasm</BrainRegion>, with many axons approaching the midline and then turning back to enter the same side of the brain as the originating eye. In marsupials, by contrast, uncrossed axons never approach the midline; instead, they remain grouped in the <BrainRegion>lateral nerve</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>chiasm</BrainRegion>. The impression gained from these data is that there is a major difference in chiasmatic architecture between eutherian and marsupial mammals. Therefore, the mechanisms by which axons choose their route through the chiasm was also thought to differ between the two major groups of mammals. However, the present study shows that the <BrainRegion>chiasm</BrainRegion> of a highly visual eutherian mammal, the tree shrew, is similar to that found in marsupials, with uncrossed axons confined to lateral regions and not approaching the midline. However, unlike marsupials, in the tree shrew, optic fascicles in the chiasm are often separated by thick collagen bundles. It is probable that the chiasmatic structure described to date for eutherian mammals is not ubiquitous, as was previously thought, and theories explaining the mechanisms by which axons chose their route through the <BrainRegion>chiasm</BrainRegion> during development will have to be expanded.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Origins and migratory routes of murine Cajal-Retzius cells.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The first layer that appears in the cortical neuroepithelium, the preplate, forms in the upper part of the <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion> immediately below the pial surface. In mice, this layer exists between embryonic days (E) 10 and 13, and it hosts different cell populations. Here, we have studied the first cell population generated in the preplate, the Cajal-Retzius cells. There is considerable confusion regarding these cells with respect to both their site of generation and the migratory routes that they follow. This perhaps is due largely to the different opinions that exist regarding their characterization. We have studied the site of origin of these cells, their migratory routes, and the molecular markers that may distinguish them by injecting tracers into early embryos, culturing them in toto for 24 hours, and then performing immunohistochemistry. We found that the Cajal-Retzius cells are most likely generated in the <BrainRegion>cortical hem</BrainRegion> by comparing with other <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> or extracortical origins. These cells are generated mainly at E10 and E11, and they subsequently migrate tangentially to cover the whole <BrainRegion>cortical mantle</BrainRegion> in 24 hours. From their site of origin in the <BrainRegion>medial wall of the telencephalon</BrainRegion>, they spread in a caudorostral direction, following an oblique migratory path toward the <BrainRegion>lateral part of the neuroepithelium</BrainRegion>. Prior to the splitting of the preplate, a percentage of the Cajal-Retzius cells that can be distinguished by the expression of reelin do not contain calretinin. Furthermore, there were no early-migrating neurons that expressed calbindin.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Subbarrel patterns of thalamocortical innervation in rat <BrainRegion>somatosensory cortical barrels</BrainRegion>: Organization and postnatal development.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Barrel hollows in the <BrainRegion>posteromedial barrel subfield of adult rat somatosensory cortex</BrainRegion> typically encompass two or three metabolically and structurally distinct regions, termed subbarrels. We used immunohistochemical staining for vesicular glutamate transporter 2 and the neuronal serotonin transporter, in conjunction with cytochrome oxidase (CO) histochemistry, to investigate the distribution of thalamocortical (TC) axon terminals in relation to subbarrel domains. We found, first, that cytochrome oxidase(CO) -dark subbarrels are more intensely immunoreactive for thalamocortical terminals than the cytochrome oxidase(CO) -light clefts that separate them. Second, during the first postnatal week, immunoreactivity for markers of thalamocortical(TC) terminals is relatively homogeneous throughout the barrel hollow; subbarrel patterns of distribution only become recognizable between P-8 and P-10. These observations extend previous findings that subbarrels denote barrel regions enriched in synaptic contacts. The data also indicate that allocation of thalamocortical(TC) terminals into subbarrel domains does not occur immediately upon <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> axon ingrowth. Instead, refinement of thalamocortical(TC) arbors into subbarrels is a gradual process, the outcome of which is not manifest until the second week of postnatal life.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Distribution of GABA-immunoreactive nerve fibers and cells in the <BrainRegion>cervical and thoracic paravertebral sympathetic trunk</BrainRegion> of adult rat: evidence for an ascending feed-forward inhibition system.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Neurochemical and immunohistochemical evidence suggests that the superior cervical ganglion (SCG) contains all components of a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic transmission system, which includes gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) ergic axons of unknown origin. The number of nerve fibers with and without gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) -like immunoreactivity was determined in interganglionic connectives at all <BrainRegion>cervical and thoracic levels of the paravertebral sympathetic trunk</BrainRegion>. In addition, the distribution of gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) -immunoreactive (IR) neurons was established within the ganglion chain and compared with the relative frequency of principal neurons richly innervated by gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) - GABA-immunoreactive(IR) axon terminals. The following results were obtained: 1) the total number of nerve fibers in cross sections did not significantly vary between the <BrainRegion>cervical levels</BrainRegion>, but it increased steadily from upper to lower <BrainRegion>thoracic segments</BrainRegion>; 2) in contrast, the number of gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) - GABA-immunoreactive(IR) fibers decreased from the <BrainRegion>cervical sympathetic trunk</BrainRegion> below the superior cervical ganglion(SCG) (approximately 300 fibers) down to the seventh to tenth thoracic ganglion, below which no such fiber was seen; 3) gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) - GABA-immunoreactive(IR) nerve fibers originate from a subclass of gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) - GABA-immunoreactive(IR) cells; these are small, bipolar neurons with predominantly ascending, unmyelinated axon-like processes; 4) the number of principal neurons richly innervated by gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) - GABA-immunoreactive(IR) nerve fibers decreased from the superior cervical ganglion(SCG) to the upper thoracic ganglia, and was very small below; and 5) apart from basket-like innervation, gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) - GABA-immunoreactive(IR) axons also formed diffuse networks around gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) -negative principal neurons predominantly in cervical and upper thoracic ganglia. These data suggest that the gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) ergic innervation of paravertebral sympathetic ganglia is more complex than previously suspected. What appears as preganglionic afferents from several spinal segments (<BrainRegion>C8-Th7</BrainRegion>) innervate gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) ergic neurons in the <BrainRegion>sympathetic trunk</BrainRegion> which have ascending axons and focus their inhibitory effects on the cervical sympathetic ganglia, predominantly the superior cervical ganglion(SCG) . These data suggest that gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) ergic small interganglionic neurons form a feed-forward inhibition system, which may be driven by multisegmental <BrainRegion>spinal</BrainRegion> input in the paravertebral sympathetic ganglion chain.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>The distribution of tyrosine hydroxylase, dopamine-beta-hydroxylase, and phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase immunoreactive neurons in the <BrainRegion>feline medulla oblongata</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The distributions and morphological characteristics of neurons displaying immunoreactivity to the catecholamine synthetic enzymes tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH), and phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase (PNMT) were examined in adjacent sections of the <BrainRegion>feline medulla oblongata</BrainRegion>. tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) -positive neurons were found in two bilaterally symmetrical columns in the <BrainRegion>ventrolateral and dorsomedial medulla</BrainRegion>. Within the <BrainRegion>ventrolateral medulla</BrainRegion>, tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) -positive neurons were found within the <BrainRegion>lateral reticular formation</BrainRegion> throughout the entire <BrainRegion>rostrocaudal extent of the medulla</BrainRegion>. In the <BrainRegion>dorsomedial medulla</BrainRegion>, tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) -immunoreactive perikarya were localized to the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the tractus solitarius</BrainRegion> including the <BrainRegion>commissural subnucleus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>area postrema</BrainRegion>. dopamine-beta-hydroxylase(DBH) -positive neurons had distributions and morphologies similar to those of the tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) -immunoreactive cells with three exceptions: tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) -positive neurons far outnumbered dopamine-beta-hydroxylase(DBH) -positive neurons in the <BrainRegion>area postrema</BrainRegion>; slightly greater numbers of tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) -positive neurons were seen in the <BrainRegion>commissural nucleus of the tractus solitarius</BrainRegion>; and, <BrainRegion>caudal to the obex</BrainRegion>, only tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) -positive neurons were seen within the <BrainRegion>dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus</BrainRegion>. phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase(PNMT) -immunoreactive neurons were found in all the <BrainRegion>nuclear regions of the medulla</BrainRegion> where both tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) - and dopamine-beta-hydroxylase(DBH) -positive neurons were seen. However, the phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase(PNMT) immunoreactive perikarya had a somewhat more restricted distribution along the rostrocaudal axis. In the <BrainRegion>ventrolateral medulla</BrainRegion>, phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase(PNMT) -positive cells extended rostrally only as far as the <BrainRegion>retrofacial nucleus</BrainRegion> and caudally only to the <BrainRegion>obex</BrainRegion>. Within the <BrainRegion>dorsomedial medulla</BrainRegion>, phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase(PNMT) immunoreactive cells were found from just rostral to the <BrainRegion>area postrema</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>medullary-spinal cord</BrainRegion> junction. These findings demonstrate that the distributions of tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) , dopamine-beta-hydroxylase(DBH) , and phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase(PNMT) immunoreactive perikarya in the <BrainRegion>medulla</BrainRegion> of the cat are generally similar to those seen in the rat insofar as these neurons are arranged in longitudinal columns in both species. However, significant differences exist with regard to the cytoarchitectonic borders within which immunoreactive perikarya can be found and the rostrocaudal extent of the phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase(PNMT) -positive cell groups in these two species.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Auditory cortex</BrainRegion> on the human <BrainRegion>posterior superior temporal gyrus</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The human <BrainRegion>superior temporal cortex</BrainRegion> plays a critical role in hearing, speech, and language, yet its functional organization is poorly understood. Evoked potentials (EPs) to auditory click-train stimulation presented binaurally were recorded chronically from penetrating electrodes implanted in <BrainRegion>Heschl&apos;s gyrus</BrainRegion> (HG), from pial-surface electrodes placed on the <BrainRegion>lateral superior temporal gyrus</BrainRegion> (STG), or from both simultaneously, in awake humans undergoing surgery for medically intractable epilepsy. The distribution of averaged Evoked potentials(EPs) was restricted to a relatively small area on the lateral surface of the <BrainRegion>posterior superior temporal gyrus</BrainRegion>(STG) . In several cases, there were multiple foci of high amplitude Evoked potentials(EPs) lying along this acoustically active portion of <BrainRegion>superior temporal gyrus</BrainRegion>(STG) . Evoked potentials(EPs) recorded simultaneously from <BrainRegion>Heschl&apos;s gyrus</BrainRegion>(HG) and <BrainRegion>superior temporal gyrus</BrainRegion>(STG) differed in their sensitivities to general anesthesia and to changes in rate of stimulus presentation. Results indicate that the acoustically active region on the <BrainRegion>superior temporal gyrus</BrainRegion>(STG) is a separate auditory area, functionally distinct from the <BrainRegion>Heschl&apos;s gyrus</BrainRegion>(HG) auditory field(s). We refer to this acoustically sensitive area of the <BrainRegion>superior temporal gyrus</BrainRegion>(STG) as the <BrainRegion>posterior lateral superior temporal area</BrainRegion> (PLST). Electrical stimulation of <BrainRegion>Heschl&apos;s gyrus</BrainRegion>(HG) resulted in short-latency Evoked potentials(EPs) in an area that overlaps <BrainRegion>posterior lateral superior temporal area</BrainRegion>(PLST) , indicating that <BrainRegion>posterior lateral superior temporal area</BrainRegion>(PLST) receives a corticocortical input, either directly or indirectly, from <BrainRegion>Heschl&apos;s gyrus</BrainRegion>(HG) . These physiological findings are in accord with anatomic evidence in humans and in nonhuman primates that the <BrainRegion>superior temporal cortex</BrainRegion> contains multiple interconnected auditory areas.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Synapses formed by olivocochlear axon branches in the mouse <BrainRegion>cochlear nucleus</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText><BrainRegion>Cochlear nucleus</BrainRegion> branches of thick olivocochlear axons were labeled by injections of horseradish peroxidase into the <BrainRegion>spiral ganglion of the cochlear basal</BrainRegion> turn in mice. Six labeled axons were traced by light microscopy, and selected portions of seven branches were sectioned serially for electron microscopic examination. Axonal branches most frequently terminated near certain granule cell regions of the <BrainRegion>ventral cochlear nucleus</BrainRegion>. This article describes terminals, synapses, and postsynaptic elements of these <BrainRegion>olivocochlear branches</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>olivocochlear branches</BrainRegion> had both terminal and en passant boutons that contained round vesicles and made asymmetric synapses with other neuronal processes. About a quarter of the synapses also possessed additional specializations, postsynaptic, or subjunctional bodies. Mossy terminals, a multisynaptic type of terminal commonly found in granule cell regions, were not found arising from any of the labeled branches. No somatic synapses were found, although contacts with cell bodies were occasionally observed. The predominant synaptic target of <BrainRegion>olivocochlear branches</BrainRegion> were what appeared to be dendrites of large diameter. At least some of these large dendrites received multiple synapses from a single labeled olivocochlear branch. The morphological characteristics of reconstructed dendrites suggest that multipolar cells might be predominant targets for the medial olivocochlear system in the <BrainRegion>cochlear nucleus</BrainRegion>. This was demonstrated in one case in which a large dendrite was followed to its cell body of origin.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>How Müller glial cells in macaque <BrainRegion>fovea</BrainRegion> coat and isolate the synaptic terminals of cone photoreceptors.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>A cone synaptic terminal in macaque <BrainRegion>fovea</BrainRegion> releases quanta of glutamate from approximately 20 active zones at a high rate in the dark. The transmitter reaches approximately 500 receptor clusters on bipolar and horizontal cell processes by diffusion laterally along the terminal&apos;s 50 microm(2) secretory face and approximately 2 microm inward. To understand what shapes transmitter flow, we investigated from electron photomicrographs of serial sections the relationship between Müller glial processes and cone terminals. We find that each Müller cell has one substantial trunk that ascends in the outer plexiform layer below the space between the "footprints" of the terminals. We find exactly equal numbers of Müller cell trunks and <BrainRegion>foveal</BrainRegion> cone terminals, which may make the <BrainRegion>fovea</BrainRegion> particularly vulnerable to Müller cell dysfunction. The processes that emerge from the single trunk do not ensheathe a single terminal. Instead, each Müller cell partially coats two to three terminals; in turn, each terminal is completely coated by two to three Müller cells. Therefore, the Müller cells that coat one terminal also partially coat the surrounding ( approximately six) terminals, creating a common environment for the cones supplying the center/surround receptive field of <BrainRegion>foveal</BrainRegion> midget bipolar and ganglion cells. Upon reaching the terminals, the trunk divides into processes that coat the terminals&apos; sides but not their secretory faces. This glial framework minimizes glutamate transporter (EAAT1) beneath a terminal's secretory face but maximizes EAAT1 between adjacent terminals, thus permitting glutamate to diffuse locally along the secretory face and inward toward inner receptor clusters but reducing its effective spillover to neighboring terminals.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Substance P immunoreactive boutons form synapses with feline sympathetic preganglionic neurons.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>In this study, the relationship between substance P-immunoreactive boutons and antidromically activated sympathetic preganglionic neurons was examined by light and electron microscopy. Sympathetic preganglionic neurons in the <BrainRegion>T2-T4 spinal segments</BrainRegion> of the cat were identified by intracellular recording and antidromic activation from the corresponding <BrainRegion>white ramus</BrainRegion>. Neurons were filled with lucifer yellow and then stained to reveal, simultaneously, substance P and lucifer yellow immunoreactivity. All of the neurons examined with the light microscope (n = 13) received appositions from substance P-immunoreactive boutons. Appositions were found on all parts of the neuron, including the somata, dendrites, and axon initial segment. In most cases (11/13) few close appositions were seen; however, two neurons received large numbers of appositions from substance P-immunoreactive boutons. On one neuron, 16 substance P-immunoreactive varicosities that were identified as being closely apposed at the light microscope level were serially sectioned and examined with the electron microscope. Of these 16 varicosities, eight either directly contacted the neuron or formed morphologically identifiable synapses. The remaining eight varicosities were separated from the neuron by thin glial processes. Two other sympathetic preganglionic neurons that were examined ultrastructurally also received substance P-immunoreactive synapses and close contacts. These findings suggest that substance P-containing nerve fibres could affect all sympathetic preganglionic neurons but are likely to be important in regulating the activity of only a small proportion of these neurons.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Vagal afferent innervation of the atria of the rat heart reconstructed with confocal microscopy.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>We have used confocal microscopy to analyze the vagal afferent innervation of the rat heart. Afferents were labeled by injecting 1,1&apos;-dioleyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine methanesulfonate (DiI) into the nodose ganglia of animals with prior supranodose de-efferentations, autonomic ganglia were stained with Fluoro-gold, and tissues were examined in whole mounts. Distinctively different fiber specializations were observed in the epi-, myo-, and endocardium: Afferents to the epicardium formed complexes associated with cardiac ganglia. These ganglia consisted of four major ganglionated plexuses, two on each atrium, at junctions of the major vessels with the atria. Ganglionic locations and sizes (left &gt; right) were consistent across animals. In addition to principal neurons (PNs), significant numbers of small intensely fluorescent (SIF) cells were located in each of these plexuses, and vagal afferents provided dense pericellular varicose endings around the small intensely fluorescent(SIF) cells in each ganglionic plexus, with few if any terminations on principal neurons(PNs) . In the myocardium, vagal afferents formed close contacts with cardiac muscles, including conduction fibers. In the endocardium, vagal fibers formed "flower-spray" and "end-net" terminals in connective tissue. With three-dimensional reconstruction of confocal optical sections, a novel polymorphism was seen: Some fibers had one or more collaterals ending as endocardial flower sprays and other collaterals ending as myocardial intramuscular endings. Some unipolar or pseudounipolar neurons within each cardiac ganglionic plexus were retrogradely labeled from the nodose ganglia. In conclusion, vagal afferents form a heterogeneity of differentiated endings in the heart, including structured elements which may mediate chemoreceptor function, stretch reception, and local cardiac reflexes.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Neuronal surface changes in the <BrainRegion>dorsal vagal motor nucleus</BrainRegion> of the guinea pig in response to axotomy.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Ultrastructural changes occurring in the <BrainRegion>dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus</BrainRegion> of the guinea pig after nerve transection were investigated. Two neuronal populations could be distinguished. Large neurons corresponding to the vagal motoneurons showed chromatolysis. They were found to develop complex changes in cell surface, which appeared either as a folding up and formation of flaplike processes or as invagination of adjacent neuronal or glial elements. Large processes often covered part of the plasmalemma and formed stacks of several neuronal lamellae. Smaller processes were mostly seen to extend into the neuropil, where they intermingled and adopted a budlike shape. These changes occurred in the cell somata within the first week after axotomy. The dendrites were affected after a short delay. The changes persisted for several months in most of the neurons, including the ones that showed signs of recovery from chromatolysis. The newly formed cellular extensions had a growth-cone-like internal structure, containing numerous smooth-surfaced vesicles or cisternae, a feltwork of filamentous material, dense-cored vesicles, and occasionally free polyribosomes. These surface changes did not occur in the second neuronal cell type of this nucleus, which had a smaller perikaryon characterized by a scanty cytoplasm. These cells did not show a retrograde degeneration and thus are probably interneurons. Acetylcholinesterase was used as a cytochemical marker of neuronal membranes. Surprisingly, the vagal motoneurons did not show a loss of enzymatic activity after nerve transection. Rather, a redistribution seemed to occur with intensified staining of the plasmalemma. The newly formed processes were consistently found to be acetylcholinesterase positive. It is suggested that the morphological changes observed correspond to an as-yet-unobserved growth process in the adult central nervous system, which involves perikarya and dendrites of regenerating guinea pig vagal motoneurons.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>The topography of primate <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>: a study of the human, bushbaby, and new- and old-world monkeys.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The distribution of ganglion cells has been studied in the <BrainRegion>retinas</BrainRegion> of four primates: the prosimian bushbaby, the New-World squirrel monkey, the Old-World crab-eating cynamolgous monkey, and the human. The sizes of ganglion cell somas were also measured at a number of <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> locations and compared with similar measurements in the cat <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> to test for the presence in primates of <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> specializations such as the visual streak, and for gradients in <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> structure, such as that between <BrainRegion>temporal and nasal retina</BrainRegion>. In all four primates, ganglion cell somas in <BrainRegion>peripheral retina</BrainRegion> ranged considerably in diameter (6-16 micrometer in the bushbaby, 8-22 micrometer in the squirrel monkey, 8-23 micrometer in the cynamolgous monkey, 8-26 micrometer in the human). It seems likely that the strong physiological correlates of soma size which have been described among cat <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> ganglion cells and among the relay cells of the macaque <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion> are generally present in primates. In all four primates, evidence was also obtained of a visual streak specialization; the isodensity lines in ganglion cell density maps were horizontally elongated, and small-bodied ganglion cells were relatively more common in the region of the proposed streak than in other areas of <BrainRegion>peripheral retina</BrainRegion>. However, the visual streak seems less well developed than in the cat; among the four primate species examined it was best developed in the bushbaby, at least as assessed by the shape of the isodensity lines. All four primates showed a clear <BrainRegion>foveal</BrainRegion> specialization, but this feature seemed least developed in the bushbaby. At the <BrainRegion>fovea</BrainRegion>, ganglion cells are smaller in soma size than in <BrainRegion>peripheral retina</BrainRegion>; they also seemed more uniform in size, although some distinctly larger cells persist in the human and bushbaby. Soma size measurements also provided evidence of a difference between <BrainRegion>nasal and temporal areas of peripheral retina</BrainRegion> comparable to that reported for the cat and other species. Thus the primate <BrainRegion>retinas</BrainRegion> examined show features, such as the <BrainRegion>foveal</BrainRegion> specialization, which seem unique to them among mammals. They also show features, such as nasal-temporal differences in ganglion cell size, and (though weakly developed) a visual streak, which they have in common with other mammals with widely different phylogenetic histories.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Morphology of thalamocortical neurons projecting to the <BrainRegion>primary somatosensory cortex</BrainRegion> and their relationship to <BrainRegion>spinothalamic</BrainRegion> terminals in the squirrel monkey.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>This study examined the morphology of thalamocortical neurons projecting to the <BrainRegion>primary somatosensory cortex</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>SI</BrainRegion>; <BrainRegion>hand region of areas 3a, 3b, 1, and 2</BrainRegion>) and their relationship to the <BrainRegion>spinothalamic</BrainRegion> (STT) terminals in the squirrel monkey. Retrogradely labeled thalamocortical neurons were intracellularly filled with Lucifer yellow (LY), and the <BrainRegion>STT</BrainRegion> terminals were anterogradely labeled with biotinylated dextran. Both filled neurons and labeled terminals were differentially visualized in the same field by a dual immunocytochemical staining method. <BrainRegion>SI</BrainRegion>-projecting neurons appeared at the light level to be in contact with <BrainRegion>STT</BrainRegion> terminal boutons in the <BrainRegion>ventroposterior lateral</BrainRegion> (VPL), <BrainRegion>ventroposterior inferior</BrainRegion> (VPI), and <BrainRegion>centrolateral (CL) nuclei</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>posterior complex</BrainRegion> (PO). The analyses of the neuronal morphology revealed that somatic and dendritic morphologies of <BrainRegion>SI</BrainRegion>-projecting neurons in these <BrainRegion>thalamic nuclei</BrainRegion>, as well as in the <BrainRegion>anterior pulvinlar</BrainRegion> (Pulo), <BrainRegion>centromedial</BrainRegion> (CM), and <BrainRegion>ventrolateral (VL) nuclei</BrainRegion>, were generally comparable with some exceptions: <BrainRegion>ventrolateral</BrainRegion>(VL) neurons had the largest soma sizes, the most primary dendrites, and the longest total dendritic length among all neurons studied; <BrainRegion>ventroposterior inferior</BrainRegion>(VPI) neurons had the smallest soma sizes; <BrainRegion>ventroposterior lateral</BrainRegion>(VPL) <BrainRegion>SI</BrainRegion>-projecting neurons were different from those in <BrainRegion>ventroposterior inferior</BrainRegion>(VPI) in their soma sizes, shape factors, and orientations; in <BrainRegion>ventroposterior lateral</BrainRegion>(VPL) the cells projecting to the superficial layers of <BrainRegion>SI</BrainRegion> were smaller than those projecting to the deeper layers, but in <BrainRegion>ventroposterior inferior</BrainRegion>(VPI) the two groups of neurons were similar in soma sizes. In general, the <BrainRegion>SI</BrainRegion>-projecting neurons in <BrainRegion>ventroposterior lateral</BrainRegion>(VPL) , <BrainRegion>ventroposterior inferior</BrainRegion>(VPI) , and <BrainRegion>centrolateral</BrainRegion>(CL) were similar in their dendritic morphologies and branching patterns, and varied from those in <BrainRegion>Pulo</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>posterior complex</BrainRegion>(PO) , <BrainRegion>centromedial</BrainRegion>(CM) , and <BrainRegion>ventrolateral</BrainRegion>(VL) .</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Structure of neurons and ganglia of the guinea pig gallbladder: light and electron microscopic studies.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>This study was undertaken to examine the morphological features of cells within ganglia of the guinea pig gallbladder, and to examine the ultrastructure of the ganglionated plexus. Gallbladder neurons are large, with a relatively simple form, having only one or two major processes. Neurobiotin often filled axons to their varicose arbors on smooth muscle in close proximity to the interganglionic connectives. With the exception of connective tissue clefts that sometimes penetrated into them, ganglia were devoid of intercellular spaces, capillaries, or connective tissue elements such as collagen and basal laminae. However, ganglia were surrounded by a single, continuous basal lamina that was enclosed within a fibroblast and collagen capsule. Within ganglia, neurons were insulated by the processes of cells that resembled the astrocyte-like glia of enteric ganglia. Although few classical synapses were observed, numerous sites of direct apposition were identified between vesicle-rich profiles and processes of gallbladder neurons. Direct appositions between vesicle-rich profiles and the ganglion-limiting basal laminae were also observed. Vesiculated profiles contained small clear vesicles and large dense-core vesicles. Within interganglionic connectives, axons were unmyelinated and were isolated from one another by processes of glia that resembled Schwann cells. As was seen in the ganglia, direct appositions between vesicle-rich profiles and the connective-limiting basal laminae were observed. The results of this study demonstrate that gallbladder ganglia are similar, ultrastructurally, to enteric ganglia in the CNS-like composition of the neuropil. However, the greater degree of glial investment, lesser degree of innervation, and simpler neurons indicated differences from the enteric nervous system that may be functionally significant.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Initial trajectories of sensory axons toward laminar targets in the developing mouse <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The formation of laminar-specific projections is a key event in the development of appropriate neuronal connections in many regions of the central nervous system. In order to provide a framework for defining functions of molecules related to <BrainRegion>spinal laminar</BrainRegion> targeting of dorsal root ganglion neurons in mice, we have characterized the initial trajectories of sensory axons in relation to the maturation of their target laminae in the spinal cord. We show that morphological and biochemical differentiation of distinct clusters of neurons in the dorsal region of the spinal cord precedes initial collateral branching from sensory axons. Between embryonic day (E) 12.5 and E13.5, sensory axons develop swelling (&quot;nodes") along their entire intraspinal extent and elaborate interstitial collateral branches from these nodes. Collaterals from the different classes of sensory axons then penetrate the <BrainRegion>gray matter of the spinal cord</BrainRegion> sequentially. Each class of sensory axons projects directly to its target lamina, never branching into inappropriate laminae en route. Some cutaneous afferents traverse the entire width of the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> to reach superficial laminae on the contralateral side, strictly avoiding both the <BrainRegion>ventral spinal cord</BrainRegion> and inappropriate laminae of the <BrainRegion>deep dorsal horn</BrainRegion>. The pathways taken by developing sensory afferents are compatible with the idea that cells in inappropriate laminae exert inhibitory influences on sensory axons which regulate their laminar specificity.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Fetal homotypic transplant in the excitotoxically neuron-depleted <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion>: light microscopy.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>One month after an in situ injection of kainic acid into the <BrainRegion>ventrobasal thalamic complex</BrainRegion> (VB), the lesioned area is totally depleted of neurons. The present study has been undertaken to determine the cytoarchitecture and connectivity of the nucleus constructed by fetal <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> neurons implanted into the excitotoxically lesioned area. Adult rats received an injection of kainic acid inducing a total neuronal depletion of the <BrainRegion>right lateral thalamus</BrainRegion> (including both the <BrainRegion>nucleus reticularis thalami</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>lateral portion of the ventrobasal complex</BrainRegion>). One month later, homotypic neurons were taken from the <BrainRegion>dorsal thalamic primordium</BrainRegion> of rat embryos (gestational age 15-16 days), dissociated, and injected into the lesioned area as a cell suspension. After 2-4-month survival, the cytoarchitecture of the neonucleus formed by the grafted neurons within the previously neuron-depleted area was analyzed. Additionally, connectivity was analyzed in seven rats in which <BrainRegion>dorsal column nuclei</BrainRegion> and/or <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> projections to the area were labeled anterogradely with either 3H-leucine or wheat-germ agglutinin conjugated to HRP, and the animals were perfused and processed following various histological procedures (Nissl staining, autoradiographic processing, and histochemistry for visualization of peroxidase). Fetal neurons grew, differentiated, and progressively occupied the previously neuron-depleted area of the adult host CNS. They organized themselves into a neonucleus with particular cytoarchitectural features including 1) the existence of two concentric zones--a central zone containing neurons and glial cells and a marginal zone only filled with a band of glial cells, 2) an increase in cellular density compared to the intact <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion>, 3) the grouping of neurons in spherical clusters, and 4) apparent polymorphism of neuronal somata. <BrainRegion>Lemniscal</BrainRegion> and corticothalamic afferents originating from the host were observed in the neonucleus when the fetal neurons had been implanted correctly into the lesioned area but not when they had been misplaced into either normal <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> tissue or the internal capsule. The afferents labeled from either the <BrainRegion>dorsal column nuclei</BrainRegion> or the <BrainRegion>somatosensory cortex</BrainRegion> were, however, less dense in the neonucleus than in the normal <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion>. These results are discussed with regard to the normal cytoarchitecture and connectivity of the <BrainRegion>ventrobasal complex</BrainRegion> of the rat <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Dlx gene expression during chick <BrainRegion>inner ear</BrainRegion> development.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Members of the Dlx gene family play essential roles in the development of the zebrafish and mouse <BrainRegion>inner ear</BrainRegion>, but little is known regarding Dlx genes and avian <BrainRegion>inner ear</BrainRegion> development. We have examined the <BrainRegion>inner ear</BrainRegion> expression patterns of Dlx1, Dlx2, Dlx3, Dlx5, and Dlx6 during the first 7 days of chicken embryonic development. Dlx1 and Dlx2 expression was seen only in nonneuronal cells of the cochleovestibular ganglion and nerves from stage 21 to stage 32. Dlx3 marks the otic placode beginning at stage 9 and becomes limited to epithelium adjacent to the <BrainRegion>hindbrain</BrainRegion> as invagination of the placode begins. Dlx3 expression then resolves to the <BrainRegion>dorsal otocys</BrainRegion>t and gradually becomes limited to the <BrainRegion>endolymphatic sac</BrainRegion> by stage 30. Dlx5 and Dlx6 expression in the developing <BrainRegion>inner ear</BrainRegion> is first seen at stages 12 and 13, respectively, in the rim of the <BrainRegion>otic pit</BrainRegion>, before spreading throughout the <BrainRegion>dorsal otocyst</BrainRegion>. As morphogenesis proceeds, Dlx5 and Dlx6 expression is seen throughout the forming <BrainRegion>semicircular canals</BrainRegion> and endolymphatic structures. During later stages, both genes are seen to mark the distal surface of the forming canals and display expression complementary to that of BMP4 in the <BrainRegion>vestibular sensory regions</BrainRegion>. Dlx5 expression is also seen in the <BrainRegion>lagena macula</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>cochlear</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>vestibular nerves</BrainRegion> by stage 30. These findings suggest important roles for Dlx genes in the vestibular and neural development of the avian <BrainRegion>inner ear</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>The long visual fibers of the dragonfly <BrainRegion>optic lobe</BrainRegion>: their cells of origin and lamina connections.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>A pair of long visual fibers projects from each <BrainRegion>ommatidium</BrainRegion> of the <BrainRegion>compound eye</BrainRegion> of the dragonfly Sympetrum. They arise from <BrainRegion>retinular</BrainRegion> cell R7 and its slender partner R6. To investigate the segregation of lamina input pathways between these and the well-described short <BrainRegion>retinular</BrainRegion> terminals, we have examined the cell morphology and en passant synaptic involvements of R7 and 6 in the ventral lamina using serial-EM and combined Golgi-EM. In the <BrainRegion>retinula</BrainRegion>, R7 has a large apical rhabdomere with microvilli aligned along the animal&apos;s horizon, and a basal axon. R6 has a few microvilli at all depths, which align with those of neighboring rhabdomeres. In the lamina, R7 and 6 neighbor on MV, the fifth monopolar cell. The stout axon of R7 has many diffusely distributed spines which contact the neighboring terminals of R5 and 8, and MII. In one entire cartridge R7 was presynaptic to MII at 24 dyads and triads throughout the lamina and also to MV at dyads exclusively in the distal lamina. Another class of element which derives from the unidentified processes called alpha was also postsynaptic to R7 at dyads, and, mostly in the proximal lamina, was reciprocally presynaptic to R7, along with R5 and 8. R6 is slender with a single conspicuous spine. At a total of three zones in the proximal lamina and <BrainRegion>distal chiasma</BrainRegion> it was presynaptic at 38 dyads--also upon MII and MV and often in combination with other elements; it was not postsynaptic in the lamina. R6 and 7 thus provide the sole input to MV and contribute to the general <BrainRegion>retinular</BrainRegion> input to MII. They form the lowest ratios of triad:dyad synapses of all lamina <BrainRegion>retinular</BrainRegion> elements. Comparison is made with the long visual fibers of other arthropods but known examples are too diverse to detect functional commonalities.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Effects of low-level x-irradiation on cat <BrainRegion>cerebella</BrainRegion> at different postnatal intervals. I. Quantitative evaluation of morphological changes.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Whole head fractionated doses of 200 r and 150 r were initiated postnatally in five experimental age groups (birth, 1-week, 2-week, 3-week and 4-week) and continued over a period of 14 or 20 days to prevent reconstitution of the external granular layer. Animals irradiated at birth displayed minor deficits in behavior, which included ataxia, tremor, hypertonus and dysmetria, while animals irradiated at 1-week showed only mild symptoms of hypermetria. All other animals displayed no motor deficits. Animals irradiated at birth had smaller eyes and ears, a reduction in the size of the entire head and were susceptible to seizures. All animals were sacrified at 70 days of age. The <BrainRegion>cerebellum</BrainRegion> was found to be reduced in size and weight, the greatest deficit being seen in animals x-irradiated at the very early ages. Newborn condition animals were found to have large compliments of interneurons in the molecular layer, an established internal granular layer, and Purkinje cells were found to have a normal orientation, position, and to be unreduced in number or size. Total granule cell deficits were found to range from 83% at birth to 29% at four weeks. Quantitative changes for the molecular layer, internal granular layer, medullary layer, Purkinje cell to granule cell ratio, and granule cell density, all depicted the greatest changes in the newborn, 1-week and 2-week conditions. This experiment confirmed that the critical period in the development at which damage would result in behavioral abnormalities was from birth to five days, while for neuroanatomical abnormalities, this critical period was from birth to 18 days.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Retinal</BrainRegion> degeneration in the nervous mutant mouse. I. Light microscopic cytopathology and changes in the interphotoreceptor matrix.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Nervous is an autosomal recessive mutation in mice (gene symbol, nr) that produces a progressive <BrainRegion>cerebellar</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> degeneration. We have examined various cytopathological features of the photoreceptor degeneration by light microscopy. An increase in the number of pyknotic <BrainRegion>photoreceptor nuclei</BrainRegion> in the outer nuclear layer (ONL) is first seen at postnatal day (P) 11. Between P13 and P19 there is a rapid loss of photoreceptors, with the outer nuclear layer(ONL) about 60% the thickness of littermate controls at P19. Between P19 and 2.5 months of age, photoreceptor cell loss is minimal, and there is a relatively slow loss of these cells between 3 and 7.5 months of age. At 7.5 months, the outer nuclear layer(ONL) consists of single row of nuclei, most of which are lost over the ensuing months, although a few <BrainRegion>photoreceptor nuclei</BrainRegion> persist at 17 months of age and older. Both rods and cones are lost at comparable rates for the first 2 months of life, but rods are somewhat preferentially lost at later ages. A very slight central-to-peripheral gradient of photoreceptor degeneration exists in the nr/nr <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>, but no superior-inferior hemispheric differences are evident. The rate, spatiotemporal gradient, and hemispheric similarity in photoreceptor degeneration are the same in albino nr/nr mice reared either in cyclic light or in the dark, and in pigmented nr/nr mice. Autoradiographic analysis of rod outer segment renewal shows that outer segment membranes are synthesized in nervous homozygotes. Rhythmic outer segment disc shedding and phagocytosis by the <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> pigment epithelium occur at approximately normal rates in nr/nr mice. Histochemical and immunocytochemical study of the interphotoreceptor matrix (IPM) reveals the exclusion of stainable interphotoreceptor matrix(IPM) from the outer segment zone by lamellar whorls of outer segment membrane, accumulation of stainable interphotoreceptor matrix(IPM) in the basal region of the outer segment zone, and the absence of an intense band of stainable interphotoreceptor matrix(IPM) at the apical surface of the <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> pigment epithelium. These changes in the interphotoreceptor matrix(IPM) are similar to those seen in the Royal College of Surgeons rat. However, comparison of cytopathological changes in these two mutants reveal that the interphotoreceptor matrix(IPM) defect probably is not the primary cause of photoreceptor cell death in nr/nr mice, and that similar phenotypic appearance does not necessarily signify similar pathological processes.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Colocalization of fixative-modified glutamate and glutaminase but not GAD in rubrospinal neurons.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>In an attempt to identify putative neurotransmitters of rubrospinal neurons, immunocytochemical procedures were utilized in combination with retrograde tracing techniques in 15 adult male rats. Following injections of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) or wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase(HRP) (WGA- horseradish peroxidase(HRP) ) into the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>, midbrain <BrainRegion>sections</BrainRegion> were processed with a combined procedure that allowed visualization of both the retrograde tracer and one or more antigens including glutamate, glutaminase, and glutamatic acid decarboxylase (GAD). Initial colocalization studies demonstrated that glutamatelike and glutaminaselike immunoreactivities were cocontained within the same neurons. Following injections of horseradish peroxidase(HRP) or WGA- horseradish peroxidase(HRP) into the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> approximately 53% of retrogradely labeled neurons contained glutamate immunoreactivity. Triple-labeling experiments indicated that glutamatelike immunoreactivity was colocalized with glutaminase immunoreactivity in retrogradely labeled rubrospinal neurons. Retrogradely labeled neurons did not contain glutamatic acid decarboxylase(GAD) immunoreactivity. Moreover, triple labeling experiments verified that glutamatelike immunoreactive retrogradely labeled cells did not cocontain glutamatic acid decarboxylase(GAD) immunoreactivity. These studies demonstrate that glutamate and its synthesizing enzyme, glutaminase, are present in some rubrospinal neurons and raise the possibility that a component of the rubrospinal projection may be glutamatergic. glutamatic acid decarboxylase(GAD) , on the other hand, is not present in rubrospinal neurons. This finding supports the hypothesis that GABAergic neurons play a role as interneurons in the <BrainRegion>red nucleus</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Structural basis of orientation sensitivity of cat <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> ganglion cells.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>We investigated the structural basis of the physiological orientation sensitivity of <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> ganglion cells (Levick and Thibos, &apos;82). The dendritic fields of 840 <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> ganglion cells labeled by injections of horseradish peroxidase into the <BrainRegion>dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion> (LGNd) or optic tracts of normal cats. Siamese cats, and cat deprived of patterned visual experience from birth by monocular lid-suture (MD) were studied. Mathematical techniques designed to analyze direction were used to find the dendritic field orientation of each cell. Statistical techniques designed for angular data were used to determine the relationship between dendritic field orientation and angular position on the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> (polar angle). Our results indicate that 88% of <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> ganglion cells have oriented dendritic fields and that dendritic field orientation is related systematically to <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> position. In all regions of <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> more that 0.5 mm from the area centralis the dendritic fields of <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> ganglion cells are oriented radially, i.e., like the spokes of a wheel having the area centralis at its hub. This relationship was present in all animals and cell types studied and was strongest for cells located close to the horizontal meridian (visual streak) of the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>. <BrainRegion>Retinal</BrainRegion> ganglion cells appear to be sensitive to stimulus orientation because they have oriented dendritic fields.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Distribution of cytochrome oxidase and parvalbumin in the <BrainRegion>primary visual cortex</BrainRegion> of the adult and neonate monkey, Callithrix jacchus.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The anatomical distributions of the mitochondrial enzyme cytochrome oxidase (CO) and of the calcium binding protein parvalbumin (PV) were studied in the <BrainRegion>striate cortex</BrainRegion> of adult and neonate New World monkeys (Callithrix jacchus). In the adult marmoset, both proteins were found in laminar arrangements similar to those described for the macaque monkey, with prominent bands of parvalbumin(PV) -like immunoreactive ( parvalbumin(PV) -LI) puncta in layers IV and IIIb, and fairly evenly distributed parvalbumin(PV) -LI nonpyramidal neurons. Furthermore, the pattern of cytochrome oxidase(CO) activity in <BrainRegion>area 17</BrainRegion> of the neonate marmoset was almost identical to the cytochrome oxidase(CO) pattern described in neonate macaque and squirrel monkeys. It came, therefore, as a surprise to find that the adult pattern of parvalbumin(PV) -like immunoreactivity ( parvalbumin(PV) -LI) in the marmoset <BrainRegion>striate cortex</BrainRegion> arises from a neonatal pattern strikingly different from that seen in any developmental stage of the macaque, or in any other mammal studied so far. In the deep layers IV through VI of the neonate marmoset, a large number of parvalbumin(PV) -LI neurons was stained in bandlike patterns, their number in layers IV and V exceeding the number of parvalbumin(PV) -LI neurons present in these layers of the adult marmoset <BrainRegion>area 17</BrainRegion>. Staining of layers IV and VI was restricted to <BrainRegion>area 17</BrainRegion> and involved nonpyramidal cells and their processes. The stained band of layer V, in contrast, continued throughout most of the neocortex. In <BrainRegion>area 17</BrainRegion>, an estimated 10 to 20% of the stained cells in layer V exhibited pyramidal shapes. The findings show that the expression of parvalbumin(PV) by visual cortical cells occurs before birth and suggest that the comparatively early onset of parvalbumin(PV) expression is not dependent on the onset of textured vision. The exuberant number of stained cells in some layers, and particularly the staining of pyramidal cells, in the neonate marmoset, suggest that a considerable number of cells possesses the stainability for parvalbumin(PV) -LI only transiently, i.e., in the marmoset, these cells have a specific demand for parvalbumin during this phase of their development.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Evidence for two distinct mechanisms of neurogenesis and cellular pattern formation in regenerated goldfish <BrainRegion>retinas</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>After its destruction by intraocular injection of ouabain, the goldfish retina regenerates, but little is known about the histogenesis of the new tissue, including the structure and formation of regenerated cell mosaic patterns. In an effort to determine how <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> cells are generated and spatially organized within <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> regenerated after ouabain injection, in situ hybridization and immunocytochemical techniques were combined with computational analyses of two-dimensional spatial patterns of identified neurons. Labeling with specific opsin riboprobes revealed two distinct cone patterns in the ouabain-injected eyes, each of which was different from the relatively orderly cone patterns of native <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>. Central, regenerated regions had sparse aggregates of cones, and a relatively lower density of each cone type. Peripheral regions of experimental <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>, likely derived from the circumferential germinal zone, had high densities of all cone types, each of which tended to be distributed randomly. The spatial patterns of inner <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> neurons in experimental eyes were also disorganized with respect to native <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>. These results indicate that although some aspects of <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> regeneration resemble normal <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> development and growth, ouabain-induced regeneration does not produce well-organized mosaics of neurons, indicating a failure of the developmental interactions needed for proper pattern formation, which in turn could compromise visual recovery. Furthermore, the distinct cone patterns in different regions of experimental <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> support the hypothesis that new goldfish <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> arises via two spatially and cellularly distinct mechanisms after exposure to ouabain.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Postnatal development of 3H-GABA-accumulating cells in rabbit <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Light and electron microscopic autoradiography demonstrates that 3H-GABA is accumulated by horizontal cells in neonatal rabbit <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> but not in the adult. A specific population of horizontal cells appears to be mature at birth and they avidly accumulate 3H-GABA during a 15-minute incubation period in vitro. Uptake into horizontal cells is not observed after the fifth postnatal day; 3H-GABA-accumulating horizontal cell bodies and their processes are the first identifiable components that clearly mark the future location of the outer plexiform layer at birth and as such, may be considered pioneering elements. Our observations raise the interesting possibility that the pioneering horizontal cell may provide structural and/or chemical factors necessary for the subsequent development of the outer plexiform layer of the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>. Labeling patterns of other <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> cells also show varying degrees of change during development. A population of amacrine cells accumulate 3H-GABA at birth. These cells show little change in their morphological or 3H-GABA uptake properties from birth to adulthood. Müller cells show weak accumulation of 3H-GABA at birth. Subsequent to this time, labeling of Müller cells is significantly more robust, resulting in Müller cell domination of <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> autoradiographic patterns in more mature <BrainRegion>retinas</BrainRegion>. Every cell body in the ganglion cell layer accumulates 3H-GABA at birth. The number of labeled cells declines during postnatal development, resulting in a very limited adult population. We conclude that the ability of <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> cells to accumulate 3H-GABA does not remain constant during postnatal development; rather each cell population displays a unique maturation sequence that results in a dramatic developmental shift in the number and types of GABA-accumulating cells present in the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>A population of nicotinic receptors is associated with thalamocortical afferents in the adult rat: laminal and areal analysis.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>In the adult rat brain, a prominent population of nicotinic cholinoceptors binds 3H-nicotine with nanomolar affinity. These receptors are abundant in most <BrainRegion>thalamic nuclei</BrainRegion> and in <BrainRegion>neocortical</BrainRegion> layers 3/4, which receive a major <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> input. To test whether <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> nicotinic receptors are associated with thalamocortical afferents, unilateral excitotoxic (N-methyl-D-aspartate) lesions were made in one of four <BrainRegion>thalamic nuclear groups</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>anterior, ventral, medial geniculate</BrainRegion>, or <BrainRegion>dorsal lateral geniculate</BrainRegion>) or in <BrainRegion>temporal cortex</BrainRegion>. After 1 or 4 weeks of survival, cortical 3H-nicotine binding was quantified via autoradiography. <BrainRegion>Thalamic</BrainRegion> lesions resulted in a partial loss of 3H-nicotine binding in <BrainRegion>ipsilateral cerebral cortex</BrainRegion>. In each <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> lesion group, the greatest decrease (35-45%) occurred within the <BrainRegion>cortical layers</BrainRegion> and area (i.e., <BrainRegion>cingulate, parietal, temporal, or occipital cortex</BrainRegion>) receiving the densest thalamocortical innervation. Binding of 3H-nicotine was also reduced within the <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion> local to the lesion, particularly at the longer survival time. Saturation analysis, performed in <BrainRegion>frontoparietal cortical</BrainRegion> tissue homogenates following <BrainRegion>ventral thalamic</BrainRegion> lesions, revealed a significant (34%) reduction in receptor density but not affinity. Direct excitotoxic lesions of the <BrainRegion>neocortex</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>temporal cortex</BrainRegion>) tended to preserve 3H-nicotine binding in layers 3/4, despite local neuronal loss. These results, taken with other published findings, suggest that some nicotinic cholinoceptors in adult rat <BrainRegion>cerebral cortex</BrainRegion> are located on thalamocortical terminals. This organizing principle appears to apply not only to sensory and motor relay projections but also to <BrainRegion>association nuclei</BrainRegion> that project to <BrainRegion>allocortical areas</BrainRegion>. These receptors may provide a local mechanism for nicotinic cholinergic modulation of thalamocortical input.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Selective distribution of mu-opioid receptors in C1 adrenergic neurons and their afferents.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Agonists of the mu-opioid receptor (MOR) have profound effects on blood pressure, heart rate, and respiration that may be mediated by C1 adrenergic neurons in the <BrainRegion>rostral ventrolateral medulla</BrainRegion> (RVL). C1 neurons are sympathoexcitatory and are involved in both tonic and reflex regulation of sympathetic outflow. This study was designed to determine whether C1 neurons, or their afferents, contain mu-opioid receptor(MOR) . C1 neurons were identified by using an antibody against the epinephrine synthesizing enzyme phenylethanolamine-N-methyl transferase (PNMT), whereas mu-opioid receptor(MOR) was localized by using an antipeptide antibody that recognizes the cloned mu-opioid receptor(MOR) , mu-opioid receptor(MOR) 1. Combined immunoperoxidase and immunogold methods were used to examine the cellular distribution of mu-opioid receptor(MOR) 1 relative to phenylethanolamine-N-methyl transferase(PNMT) -containing neurons in the <BrainRegion>rostral ventrolateral medulla</BrainRegion>(RVL) . mu-opioid receptor(MOR) 1 was found in 22% of phenylethanolamine-N-methyl transferase(PNMT) -containing dendrites (n = 392), whereas mu-opioid receptor(MOR) 1-containing axons or axon terminals contacted 14% of phenylethanolamine-N-methyl transferase(PNMT) -containing dendrites. This distribution was heterogenous with regard to dendritic size: phenylethanolamine-N-methyl transferase(PNMT) -labeled dendrites containing mu-opioid receptor(MOR) 1 were usually large (60% were &amp;gt;1.2 microm), whereas phenylethanolamine-N-methyl transferase(PNMT) -containing dendrites that received mu-opioid receptor(MOR) 1-labeled afferents were usually small (79% were &lt;1.2 microm). Individual dendrites rarely contained mu-opioid receptor(MOR) 1 at both pre- and postsynaptic sites. Together these results suggest that mu-opioid receptor(MOR) agonists may directly influence the activity of C1 neurons, as well as the activity of select afferents to these cells. Plasmalemmal membrane labeling for mu-opioid receptor(MOR) 1 was more frequent in smaller phenylethanolamine-N-methyl transferase(PNMT) -containing dendrites, suggesting that postsynaptic receptors are more readily available for ligand binding in small dendrites, although the receptor was more frequently detected in larger phenylethanolamine-N-methyl transferase(PNMT) dendrites. The selective distribution of mu-opioid receptor(MOR) s to specific pre- and postsynaptic sites suggests the receptor may be selectively trafficked to positions where it may regulate afferent activity that is heterogeneously distributed along the dendritic tree of C1 neurons.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Somatotopic and functional organization of the avian trigeminal ganglion: an HRP analysis in the hatchling chick.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>While the somatotopic organization of many central systems is well characterized, that of peripheral sensory neurons has not been adequately defined. This is especially true for the trigeminal ganglion. By applying HRP subcutaneously at each of 14 sites and also intramuscularly, it is possible to determine whether the location of sensory neurons within the ganglion reflects their peripheral projections. There is no discernible somatotopic organization of neurons in the <BrainRegion>ophthalmic lobe</BrainRegion>. However, the location of maxillary neurons in the <BrainRegion>maxillo-mandibular lobe</BrainRegion> is organized with the most posterior cells projecting to sites closest to the ganglion and with neurons located more anteriorly projecting to progressively more distant sites. There is a less well defined organization in the superior-inferior axis of the ganglion, and none along its proximal (root) to distal axis. Mandibular exteroceptive neurons are found primarily in the <BrainRegion>anterior region of the maxillo-mandibular lobe</BrainRegion>, while mandibular proprioceptive cells are located in the proximo-central part of this lobe. In most cases there is a considerable scattering of horseradish peroxidase ( horseradish peroxidase(HRP) )-filled neurons. Projections to contralateral ganglia, the <BrainRegion>trigeminal motor nucleus</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>trigeminal mesencephalic nucleus</BrainRegion> were also examined. Cytologically, the hatchling trigeminal consists of two interspersed types of neurons: large, lightly staining and smaller, darkly staining cells. Previous experiments have proved that these two cell types do not correspond to each of the embryonic precursors of trigeminal neurons, the <BrainRegion>neural crest</BrainRegion> and placodal cells. In this study horseradish peroxidase(HRP) was found localized in both classes of neurons following injection at all sites, including jaw-closing muscles. This indicates that the dual cytology is not correlated with either distribution of peripheral fibers or exteroceptive vs. proprioceptive functions. The possibilities that the two types of neurons may have different central projections and/or may be related to visceral vs. somatic afferent functions are discussed.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Cellular distribution and subcellular localization of molecular components of vesicular transmitter release in horizontal cells of rabbit <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The mechanism underlying transmitter release from retinal horizontal cells is poorly understood. We investigated the possibility of vesicular transmitter release from mammalian horizontal cells by examining the expression of synaptic proteins that participate in vesicular transmitter release at chemical synapses. Using immunocytochemistry, we evaluated the cellular and subcellular distribution of complexin I/II, syntaxin-1, and synapsin I in rabbit <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>. Strong labeling for complexin I/II, proteins that regulate a late step in vesicular transmitter release, was found in both synaptic layers of the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>, and in somata of A- and B-type horizontal cells, of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)- and glycinergic amacrine cells, and of ganglion cells. Immunoelectron microscopy demonstrated the presence of complexin I/II in horizontal cell processes postsynaptic to rod and cone ribbon synapses. Syntaxin-1, a core protein of the soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive-factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complex known to bind to complexin, and synapsin I, a synaptic vesicle-associated protein involved in the Ca(2+)-dependent recruitment of synaptic vesicles for transmitter release, were also present in the horizontal cells and their processes at photoreceptor synapses. Photoreceptors and bipolar cells did not express any of these proteins at their axon terminals. The presence of complexin I/II, syntaxin-1, and synapsin I in rabbit horizontal cell processes and tips suggests that a vesicular mechanism may underlie transmitter release from mammalian horizontal cells.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Olivocochlear and vestibular efferent neurons of the feline <BrainRegion>brain stem</BrainRegion>: their location, morphology and number determined by retrograde axonal transport and acetylcholinesterase histochemistry.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Anterograde degeneration studies have shown that the <BrainRegion>cochlear</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>vestibular receptor organs</BrainRegion> receive an efferent innervation from neurons in the <BrainRegion>brain stem</BrainRegion>. This pathway may provide a mechanism by which the CNS could modulate its own afferent input. The neurons which provide this innervation have so far escaped positive identification with methods which depend on retrograde cell changes after axotomy. In the present study, horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was injected into the labryinths of kittens and after allowing 24 hours for the retrograde axonal transport of this tracer, its presence in neurons of the <BrainRegion>brain stem</BrainRegion> was demonstrated histochemically. Because there is evidence that the efferent innervation of the <BrainRegion>labyrinth</BrainRegion> is cholinergic, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) was also demonstrated histochemically in the same or in adjacent tissue sections. Neurons labelled with horseradish peroxidase(HRP) were found bilaterally in most periolivary cell groups of the <BrainRegion>superior olivary complex</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>cochlear</BrainRegion> efferents) and in the <BrainRegion>parvocellular reticular nucleus</BrainRegion> lateral to the <BrainRegion>abducens nucleus</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>vestibular</BrainRegion> efferents). Counts of labelled neurons yielded estimated totals of 1,700-1,800 <BrainRegion>cochlear</BrainRegion> and 400-500 <BrainRegion>vestibular</BrainRegion> efferent neurons. Approximately 60% of the neurons in each total were located on the side ipsilateral to the injection. The distribution of horseradish peroxidase(HRP) -labelled neurons was virtually identical to that of acetylcholinesterase(AChE) -positive neurons found in adjacent sections, and in those regions with predominantly ipsilateral or contralateral projections, there was an approximate correspondence in number of horseradish peroxidase(HRP) - and acetylcholinesterase(AChE) -positive neurons. In tissue sections processed successively for demonstration of horseradish peroxidase(HRP) and acetylcholinesterase(AChE) , virtually all horseradish peroxidase(HRP) -labelled neurons were found to be acetylcholinesterase(AChE) -positive. These findings suggest that a number of current conceptions regarding labyrinthine efferent systems may need revision.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Coexistence of glutamate and substance P in <BrainRegion>dorsal root ganglion neurons</BrainRegion> of the rat and monkey.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Antisera to a glutamate (Glu) conjugate, to glutaminase (GLN), and to substance P (SP) have been used to investigate the issue of putative glutamergic neurons in the <BrainRegion>dorsal root ganglia</BrainRegion> (DRG) and the possible coexistence in these neurons of glutamate(Glu) and substance P(SP) . The glutamate(Glu) antiserum, characterized by immunoadsorption and immunoblot tests, is highly selective for glutamate(Glu) out of a number of other amino acids including aspartate. Quantitative data were gathered from consecutive 4-microns-thick paraffin sections from cervical ganglia of rats with or without <BrainRegion>spinal</BrainRegion> injections of colchicine and from one monkey not treated with colchicine. Neurons containing more than one antigen could be identified on adjacent sections tested with the three different antisera. Neurons labeled by the glutamate(Glu) -antiserum represent 15-30% of the <BrainRegion>dorsal root ganglia</BrainRegion>(DRG) population in untreated rats. They include most of the small neurons (with mean perikaryal area around 300-400 microns) but also larger neurons (with perikaryal area greater than 600 microns). <BrainRegion>dorsal root ganglia</BrainRegion>(DRG) neurons labeled by either the glutaminase(GLN) or the substance P(SP) antiserum are small (mean area 335-375 microns and 356-374 microns, respectively) and account for approximately 40 and 15%, respectively, of the sampled neurons. In colchicine-treated rats the number of glutamate(Glu) -positive neurons increases up to about 70%. The same treatment also increases the number of substance P(SP) -positive neurons but not that of glutaminase(GLN) -positive neurons. In the monkey about half of the <BrainRegion>dorsal root ganglia</BrainRegion>(DRG) neurons are glutamate(Glu) positive and, as in rats, they are mostly small. glutaminase(GLN) -positive neurons in the same species account for about half of the <BrainRegion>dorsal root ganglia</BrainRegion>(DRG) population and are only small. In rats, about 60-80% of glutamate(Glu) -positive neurons are also glutaminase(GLN) -positive and most glutaminase(GLN) -positive neurons are glutamate(Glu) positive. In colchicine-treated rats, close to 90% of substance P(SP) -positive neurons are also positive for glutamate(Glu) and about 60% of substance P(SP) -positive neurons are triple labeled. In the monkey&apos;s <BrainRegion>dorsal root ganglia</BrainRegion>(DRG) s, whose sections were not processed for substance P(SP) , most glutamate(Glu) - or glutaminase(GLN) -positive neurons are also positive for the other antiserum used. Several considerations argue against the possibility that, under the present experimental conditions, the glutamate(Glu) antiserum is a metabolic marker. It is therefore suggested that glutamate(Glu) -positive neurons may use glutamate(Glu) as neurotransmitter. Coexistence of glutamate(Glu) and substance P(SP) in some <BrainRegion>dorsal root ganglia</BrainRegion>(DRG) neurons suggests that both agents may be released by terminals of primary afferents from the same <BrainRegion>dorsal root ganglia</BrainRegion>(DRG) neuron.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>The postnatal development of the tract of Lissauer in the rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>This study determined the numbers of axons in the tract of Lissauer of the S2 segment of rat <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> during postnatal development. One day after birth there were an average of 39 myelinated and 9,520 unmyelinated axons in this pathway. These numbers changed steadily to the 722 myelinated and 2,759 unmyelinated axons that characterize the adult. Thus there was a 20-fold increase in myelinated axons but a threefold decrease in total axons in this pathway from birth to adulthood. The axonal changes occurred so long after the changes in the number of cells that give rise to these axons that the axonal changes were almost certainly not due to the death of their parent neurons. We do not yet understand the mechanisms that control axonal numbers in this pathway, but in our opinion these mechanisms are as important as those that control neuronal numbers in considerations of the development of the nervous system.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Effects of estrogen replacement therapy on cholinergic <BrainRegion>basal forebrain</BrainRegion> neurons and <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> cholinergic innervation in young and aged ovariectomized rhesus monkeys.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Estrogen modulates the function of cholinergic <BrainRegion>basal forebrain</BrainRegion> neurons in aged female rats. The present study tested the hypothesis that estrogen enhances the phenotype of cholinergic <BrainRegion>basal forebrain</BrainRegion> neurons and their <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> cholinergic innervation in young adult and aged ovariectomized rhesus monkeys. Sixteen monkeys (9 young and 7 aged) received two injections of estradiol cypionate or vehicle separated by 3 weeks. All monkeys were killed 1 day after the last injection. Quantitative immunofluorescence in the <BrainRegion>vertical limb of the diagonal band</BrainRegion> (VLDB) revealed enhanced optical density for choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) in both young and aged monkeys treated with estrogen. In contrast, optical density for low-affinity p75 neurotrophin receptor immunoreactivity in the <BrainRegion>vertical limb of the diagonal band</BrainRegion>(VLDB) did not change after estrogen treatment in either aged or young animals. Quantitative immunofluorescence for either choline acetyltransferase(ChAT) or the low-affinity p75 neurotrophin receptor in the <BrainRegion>nucleus basalis Meynert</BrainRegion> failed to reveal differences between vehicle and estrogen treatment in either age group. Quantitative estimates of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) fiber density revealed that estrogen-treated aged monkeys but not their younger counterparts had decreased numbers of acetylcholinesterase(AChE) -positive fibers in layer II of <BrainRegion>frontal, insular, and cingulate cortices</BrainRegion>. These data indicate that estrogen administered in a manner simulating natural hormonal cyclicity produces modest age-specific chemical phenotypic and regional changes in select neuronal subfields of the cholinergic <BrainRegion>basal forebrain</BrainRegion> and their <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> projection sites in nonhuman primates.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Central projections of axons from taste hairs on the <BrainRegion>labellum</BrainRegion> and tarsi of the blowfly, Phormia regina Meigen.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Taste hairs are located on the <BrainRegion>labellum</BrainRegion> and tarsi of blowflies. These multimodal hairs consist of four functionally distinct chemoreceptors and a mechanoreceptor. By staining selected multimodal hairs, we sought to identify the central projection patterns of multiple and single axons from those hairs. On each side of the <BrainRegion>labellum</BrainRegion> there are 11 &quot;largest" hairs (LH). The neurons associated with the anteriormost ( "largest" hairs(LH) -1), posteriormost ( "largest" hairs(LH) -11), and one lateral ( "largest" hairs(LH) -6) hair on the <BrainRegion>labellum</BrainRegion> were stained selectively with cobaltous sulfide. The overall projection pattern in the central nervous system (CNS) for axons from &quot;largest" hairs(LH) -1 and "largest" hairs(LH) -11 is similar and differs markedly from axons from "largest" hairs(LH) -6. At least three individual axon-projection patterns were determined for each <BrainRegion>labellar</BrainRegion> hair filled, indicating a partial functional organization for axons from multimodal hairs. One identified axon, the dorsalmost axon, has terminal arborizations that do not differ with the location of its associated hair. Another axon, thicker than the others, projects to a region that is distinct from the four thin axons. Within this region the arborizations of the thick axons occupy different areas depending on the location of their associated hair. Neurons from the largest hairs on the distalmost tarsomere (D5) of each leg were also stained and consisted of one thick and four thin axons. All axons except one thin axon from tarsal D5 hairs terminate in their respective leg neuromeres. The remaining thin axon projects to the suboesophageal ganglion ipsilateral to the hair filled and terminates in the same region as a branch of the <BrainRegion>labellar</BrainRegion> dorsalmost axon. These data suggest that axonal arbors from multimodal hairs have a limited functional and somatotopic organization in the blowfly central nervous system(CNS) .</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Upregulation of aggrecan, link protein 1, and hyaluronan synthases during formation of perineuronal nets in the rat <BrainRegion>cerebellum</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Extracellular matrix molecules accumulate around central nervous system neurons during postnatal development, forming so-called perineuronal nets (PNNs). perineuronal nets(PNNs) play a role in restricting plasticity at the end of critical periods. In the adult rat <BrainRegion>cerebellum</BrainRegion>, perineuronal nets(PNNs) are found around large, <BrainRegion>deep cerebellar nuclei</BrainRegion> (DCN) neurons and Golgi neurons and are composed of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs), tenascin-R (TN-R), hyaluronan (HA), and link proteins, such as cartilage link protein 1 (Crtll). Granule cells and Purkinje cells are surrounded by a partially organized matrix. Both glial cells and neurons surrounded by perineuronal nets(PNNs) are the site of synthesis of some chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans(CSPGs) and of tenascin-R(TN-R) , but only neurons produce hyaluronan(HA) synthetic enzymes ( hyaluronan(HA) Ss), thus hyaluronan(HA) , and link proteins, which are scaffolding molecules for an organized matrix. To elucidate the mechanisms of formation of perineuronal nets(PNNs) , we analyzed by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization which PNN components are upregulated during PNN formation in rat <BrainRegion>cerebellar</BrainRegion> postnatal development and what cell types express them. We observed that Wisteria floribunda agglutinin-binding perineuronal nets(PNNs) develop around <BrainRegion>deep cerebellar nuclei</BrainRegion>(DCN) neurons from postnatal day (P)7 and around Golgi neurons from P14. At the same time as their perineuronal nets(PNNs) start to form, these neurons upregulate aggrecan, cartilage link protein 1(Crtll) , and hyaluronan(HA) Ss mRNAs. However, cartilage link protein 1(Crtll) is the only PNN component to be expressed exclusively in neurons surrounded by perineuronal nets(PNNs) . The other link protein that shows a perineuronal net pattern in the <BrainRegion>deep cerebellar nuclei</BrainRegion>(DCN) , Bral2, is upregulated later during development. These data suggest that aggrecan, hyaluronan(HA) , and, particularly, cartilage link protein 1(Crtll) might be crucial elements for the initial assembly of perineuronal nets(PNNs) .</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Distribution of immunoreactivity for the NK1 receptor on different subpopulations of sympathetic preganglionic neurons in the rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The distribution of immunoreactivity to the receptor for substance P, the neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptor, was examined in preganglionic sympathetic neurons of the rat by using immunohistochemistry and retrograde neuronal tracing. About one-third of all sympathetic preganglionic neurons were neurokinin 1(NK1) receptor immunoreactive, and most of the neurokinin 1(NK1) receptor-immunoreactive neurons were also nitric oxide synthase immunoreactive. The proportions of sympathetic preganglionic neurons projecting to the superior and inferior mesenteric ganglia, adrenal gland, and lumbar sympathetic chain which were neurokinin 1(NK1) receptor-immunoreactive were determined. Most (89%) of the preganglionic neurons projecting to the adrenal glands were neurokinin 1(NK1) receptor immunoreactive. Few (17%) of the preganglionic neurons projecting to the L5 sympathetic chain ganglion were immunoreactive for the receptor, while preganglionic neurons projecting to the prevertebral ganglia were neurokinin 1(NK1) receptor immunoreactive at intermediate frequencies (61-64%). Thus, substance P acting on neurokinin 1(NK1) receptors is likely to be important in the preganglionic pathways to the adrenal medulla and viscera via the prevertebral ganglia, but is unlikely to be important in pathways to the lumbar sympathetic chain. The co-localisation of the neurokinin 1(NK1) receptor with the enzyme nitric oxide synthase was also examined. The majority of neurokinin 1(NK1) receptor-immunoreactive neurons were also nitric oxide synthase immunoreactive. Thus neurokinin 1(NK1) receptors occur on preganglionic neurons over many spinal segments and in a range of preganglionic pathways, as well as in a range of combinations with nitric oxide synthase. The heterogeneity of preganglionic neurons showing neurokinin 1(NK1) receptor immunoreactivity may reflect the involvement of neurokinin 1(NK1) -mediated transmission in a variety of functional pathways, most notably the preganglionic projections to the adrenal medulla and to the viscera.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Central administration of neuropeptide FF (NPFF) causes increased neuronal activation and up-regulation of NPFF gene expression in the rat brainstem.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Neuropeptide FF (NPFF) is a morphine modulatory peptide that plays an important role in a wide variety of physiological functions, including those related to nociception and central autonomic regulation. Neuropeptide FF(NPFF) fibers and cells have been shown to be discretely localized in key autonomic centers within the brain, including the <BrainRegion>brainstem nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion> (NTS). Central applications of Neuropeptide FF(NPFF) evoke a number of important biological effects through activation of central neuronal circuits whose identities remain unknown at present. Neuropeptide FF(NPFF) administered in this manner may also be capable of up- or down-regulating its own gene expression. In this study, we investigated the effects of intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of Neuropeptide FF(NPFF) on the activation and the gene expression of Neuropeptide FF(NPFF) in <BrainRegion>nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion>(NTS) neurons. Conscious rats received saline or Neuropeptide FF(NPFF) (8 or 10 microg intracerebroventricular(i.c.v.) ), with concomitant monitoring of arterial blood pressure. Brains were prepared for Fos immunohistochemistry to identify neuronal activation and Neuropeptide FF(NPFF) in situ hybridization to determine cells expressing Neuropeptide FF(NPFF) mRNA in the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion>(NTS) . At a dose of 8 microg, intracerebroventricular(i.c.v.) , Neuropeptide FF(NPFF) did not evoke alterations in blood pressure, but, at 10 microg, there was an increase in arterial blood pressure of 30-40 mmHg. Image analysis showed a dose-dependent increase in number of Neuropeptide FF(NPFF) neurons that were activated in rats receiving intracerebroventricular(i.c.v.) Neuropeptide FF(NPFF) compared with saline controls. Neuropeptide FF(NPFF) gene expression in the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion>(NTS) showed a similar dose-dependent increase following intracerebroventricular(i.c.v.) administration of either 8 or 10 microg of Neuropeptide FF(NPFF) . Significantly greater numbers of activated neurons expressing the Neuropeptide FF(NPFF) gene (double labeled) were observed in the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion>(NTS) at the level of the <BrainRegion>area postrema</BrainRegion> in animals receiving intracerebroventricular(i.c.v.) Neuropeptide FF(NPFF) compared with saline controls. These data indicate that centrally administered Neuropeptide FF(NPFF) is capable of up-regulating its own gene expression in the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion>(NTS) and that this effect appears in part to be independent of elevations in arterial blood pressure that this peptide can evoke when administered intracerebroventricular(i.c.v.) at the higher dose. The up-regulation of Neuropeptide FF(NPFF) may play a homeostatic role in response to specific cardiovascular challenges, such as hypotension.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Development of retinotopy in projections from the <BrainRegion>eye</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion> of the wallaby (Macropus eugenii).</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The development of retinotopy in projections from the <BrainRegion>eye</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>dorsal lateral geniculate</BrainRegion> (dLGN) and <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion> (SC) has been studied in the marsupial wallaby. Discrete <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> lesions were made and the remaining <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> projections were traced with horseradish peroxidase in animals at stages ranging from just after <BrainRegion>optic</BrainRegion> innervation of the <BrainRegion>dorsal lateral geniculate</BrainRegion>(dLGN) and <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion>(SC) to the time when the projections are mature. Topographically organised projections could be recognized a few weeks after axons first reached the <BrainRegion>dorsal lateral geniculate</BrainRegion>(dLGN) and <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion>(SC) with a topographically discrete projection from <BrainRegion>nasoventral retinal</BrainRegion> recognized later than from <BrainRegion>dorsal, dorso-temporal, temporal, and temporoventral retina</BrainRegion>. Over time there was an increase in precision of the retinotopy as judged by an increase in sharpness of the borders of filling defects in the projection labelled with horseradish peroxidase. Refinement of the projection from <BrainRegion>temporal retina</BrainRegion> preceded that from <BrainRegion>nasal retina</BrainRegion> in both the <BrainRegion>dorsal lateral geniculate</BrainRegion>(dLGN) and <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion>(SC) and in the former occurred concomitantly with the segregation of eye-specific terminal bands. Refinement was complete 16 weeks after birth, prior to eye opening at around 20 weeks after birth. Inequalities in retinal representations in both nuclei were present from the time retinotopy could first be detected. This was before the inequalities in <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> ganglion cell distribution, which underly these representations in the adult, were obvious. Retinotopy and inequalities in <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> representation characteristic of the adult are present from a very early stage in the protracted development of visual projections in the wallaby. Refinement may involve death of inappropriately projecting cells, pruning of inappropriately projecting axon arborizations or could be achieved by growth of the retinorecipient neuropil. Temporonasal differences in the time course of refinement may reflect gradients of maturation in the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Quantitative study of granule and Purkinje cells in the <BrainRegion>cerebellar cortex</BrainRegion> of the rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The numerical densities of granule and Purkinje cells in the <BrainRegion>cerebellar cortex</BrainRegion> of the rat were determined by stereological methods. The density of Purkinje cells in our fixed material was 1,018 +/- 39 per mm2 (mean +/- s.e.m.) of Purkinje cell layer and that of granule cells 1.92 +/- 0.03 x 10(6) per microliter of granular layer. The total area of Purkinje cell layer was 332 mm2 and the volume of granular layer was 48 microliters. The rat <BrainRegion>cerebellum</BrainRegion> therefore contains 3.38 x 10(5) Purkinje cells and 9.2 x 10(7) granule cells, from which there are 274 granule cells for each Purkinje cell. The density of granule cells and the density of parallel fibers in the molecular layer observed in a companion study indicate that the average length of a parallel fiber is around 5 mm.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Organization of projections from the <BrainRegion>dorsomedial nucleus of the hypothalamus</BrainRegion>: a PHA-L study in the rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The axonal projections of the <BrainRegion>dorsomedial nucleus of the hypothalamus</BrainRegion> were investigated by using Phaseolous vulgaris-leucoagglutinin. The main conclusion of this work is that these projections are largely <BrainRegion>intrahypothalamic</BrainRegion>, with smaller components directed toward the <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>telencephalon</BrainRegion>. Although the <BrainRegion>intrahypothalamic</BrainRegion> pathways are very complex and intermix at various levels, we conclude that <BrainRegion>dorsomedial nucleus</BrainRegion> outputs follow three distinct ascending pathways: periventricular, coursing through the <BrainRegion>hypothalamic periventricular zone</BrainRegion>; ventral, traveling beneath the <BrainRegion>medial zone</BrainRegion>; and lateral, ascending in <BrainRegion>medial parts of the lateral hypothalamic area</BrainRegion>. Within the <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion>, the most densely innervated areas are the <BrainRegion>paraventricular nucleus</BrainRegion>, other <BrainRegion>dorsal regions of the periventricular zone</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>preoptic suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>parastrial nucleus</BrainRegion>. Other significant terminal fields include the <BrainRegion>median preoptic</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>anteroventral periventricular</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>lateral part of the medial preoptic</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>anteroventral preoptic nuclei</BrainRegion>; and the <BrainRegion>retrochiasmatic</BrainRegion> (including <BrainRegion>perisuprachiasmatic) area</BrainRegion>. Descending projections follow two pathways that also converge at various levels: a dorsal pathway in the <BrainRegion>midbrain</BrainRegion> periventricular system travels through, and primarily innervates, the <BrainRegion>periaqueductal and pontine gray</BrainRegion>, and a ventral pathway extends through <BrainRegion>ventromedial regions of the brainstem</BrainRegion>. Although sparse, fibers in the later pathway can be traced as far caudally as the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion>. The results are discussed relative to the pathways and properties of nearby <BrainRegion>hypothalamic medial zone nuclei</BrainRegion>. <BrainRegion>Dorsomedial nucleus</BrainRegion> projections are similar to certain other nuclei (e.g., <BrainRegion>anteroventral periventricular and parastrial</BrainRegion>) with predominantly <BrainRegion>intrahypothalamic</BrainRegion> projections, and different from those arising in the <BrainRegion>medial zone nuclei</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>medial preoptic</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>anterior hypothalamic</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>ventromedial</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>mammillary</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>The distribution and origin of serotonin-containing fibers in the <BrainRegion>septal area</BrainRegion>: a combined immunohistochemical and fluorescent retrograde tracing study in the rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The distribution of 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin, 5-HT)-containing nerve fibers and terminals in the <BrainRegion>septal area</BrainRegion> of the rat was studied by using immunohistochemistry with specific antibodies to 5-HT in combination with fluorescent retrograde tracing methods. The 5-HT innervation of the <BrainRegion>septum</BrainRegion> is heterogeneous with regard to both the morphology of individual processes and the density of distribution in different parts of the <BrainRegion>septum</BrainRegion>. Three major classes of 5-HT like immunoreactive processes can be distinguished: 1) thin, convoluted fibers with small, round or elongated varicosities; 2) thick and relatively straight fibers with few varicosities; and 3) <BrainRegion>pericellular plexuses</BrainRegion> with large varicosities in close association with perikarya in the <BrainRegion>lateral septum</BrainRegion>. Three areas of the <BrainRegion>septum</BrainRegion> receive a prominent innervation by 5-HT processes: the <BrainRegion>diagonal band of Broca</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>ventral part of the lateral septum</BrainRegion>, and an area bordering the <BrainRegion>medial edge of the islands of Calleja </BrainRegion>(<BrainRegion>insula magna</BrainRegion>). Whereas the two latter areas contain dense terminal networks, the <BrainRegion>diagonal band of Broca</BrainRegion> is occupied primarily by 5-HT fibers en route to other parts of the <BrainRegion>septum</BrainRegion>. Intraseptal injections of HRP or fluorescent dyes (granular blue, propidium iodide) resulted in retrograde labeling of neuronal cell bodies in several <BrainRegion>nuclei of the brainstem</BrainRegion> which are known to contain 5-HT neurons: the <BrainRegion>dorsal raphe</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>median raphe</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>raphe pontis</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>raphe magnus</BrainRegion>. Where fluorescent retrograde tracing was performed with 5-HT immunohistochemistry on the same tissue section, a prominent 5-HT containing pathway and a non-5-HT-containing pathway from the <BrainRegion>raphe nuclei</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>septum</BrainRegion> were revealed. Finally, double retrograde fluorescent labeling after injections of granular blue or propidium iodide into the <BrainRegion>septum</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>entorhinal area</BrainRegion> respectively of the same rat revealed extensive branching of the <BrainRegion>raphe</BrainRegion> efferents. Thus, individual <BrainRegion>raphe</BrainRegion> neurons may simultaneously connect with <BrainRegion>septum</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>entorhinal area</BrainRegion>, two structures essential for normal <BrainRegion>hippocampal</BrainRegion> function.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Influence of mitochondrial protein synthesis inhibition on deafferentation-induced ultrastructural changes in <BrainRegion>nucleus magnocellularis</BrainRegion> of developing chicks.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Following <BrainRegion>cochlea</BrainRegion> removal in developing chicks, about 30% of the neurons in the ipsilateral second-order <BrainRegion>auditory nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>nucleus magnocellularis</BrainRegion>, undergo cell death. Administration of chloramphenicol, a mitochondrial protein synthesis inhibitor, results in a pronounced increase in deafferentation-induced cell death. In this study, we examined whether the chloramphenicol enhancement of deafferentation-induced cell death reveals the same ultrastructural characteristics that are seen in degenerating <BrainRegion>nucleus magnocellularis</BrainRegion> neurons after <BrainRegion>cochlea</BrainRegion> removal alone. Unilateral <BrainRegion>cochlea</BrainRegion> removal was performed on anaesthetized posthatch chicks. One group of animals was simultaneously treated with chloramphenicol. Six, twelve, or twenty-four hours following <BrainRegion>cochlea</BrainRegion> removal, <BrainRegion>n. magnocellularis</BrainRegion> neurons were studied by routine transmission electron microscopy. Particular attention was paid to the integrity of the polyribosomes and rough endoplasmic reticulum. Two ultrastructurally different types of neuronal degeneration were observed in the deafferented <BrainRegion>nucleus magnocellularis</BrainRegion> neurons: an early onset electron-lucent type that always involved ribosomal dissociation and a late-onset electron-dense type displaying nuclear pyknosis and severely damaged mitochondria. The percentage of <BrainRegion>nucleus magnocellularis</BrainRegion> neurons displaying ribosomal disintegration following <BrainRegion>cochlea</BrainRegion> removal was found to be markedly increased after chloramphenicol treatment. This finding suggests that mitochondrial function is important for the maintenance of a functional protein synthesis apparatus following deafferentation.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Development and degeneration of <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> in rds mutant mice: electron microscopy.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>In the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> of mice homozygous for the <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> degeneration slow (rds) gene, receptor outer segments failed to develop and typical disc structures were never observed. However, cilia surrounded by a plasma membrane were regularly present. At the time when outer segments grew in the normal <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>optic ventricle</BrainRegion> in the mutant showed an accumulation of membrane-bound vesicles of varying size and density. The vesicles declined in frequency at later stages of degeneration. After initial growth, the inner segments in the mutant <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> remained stunted but maintained their morphological differentiation, including the ciliary structures. Their number declined with loss of visual cells. In the mutant retina development of synapses, between the receptor cells and the processes of the horizontal cells and the bipolar cell dendrites, followed in normal sequence. Formation of spherule terminals of the rods, with one triad synapse, and of pedicle terminals of the cones, with multiple triad synapses, was recorded in the same way as in the normal <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>. With loss of visual cells in the mutant <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>, some of the profiles of the surviving spherule terminals showed an increased occurrence of two, three, or more synaptic sites. This growth resulted from enlargement and branching of the ribbons and sprouting from the postsynaptic elements. Similar changes were not observed in the pedicle terminals. The pigment epithelial cells in the mutant mice appeared initially normal, but phagolysosomal structures were absent. However, various inclusion bodies appeared within the pigment epithelial cells following degenerative changes in the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>. In some places, the basal infoldings deepened their furrows while thinning the cytoplasmic part of the epithelium. Failure to form the outer segments and the subsequent lysis of the visual cells appear to be the primary effects of the <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> degeneration slow(rds) gene, whereas the synaptic growth in the sperule terminals and the changes in the pigment epithelium appear to be consequential to those defects.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Innervation of the external urethral and external anal sphincters in higher primates.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Stimulating electrodes were placed on the terminal branches of the pudendal nerve to the external urethral and external anal sphincters. The proximity of the electrodes to the sphincters assured organ specificity. Evoked responses produced by stimulation of these terminal nerve branches were recorded in the fascicles and <BrainRegion>rootlets of the lower thoracic, lumbar, and sacral nerve roots</BrainRegion>. By this method, the segmental <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> origin of the innervation of the external urethral and anal sphincters was determined for the Rhesus monkey and chimpanzee. The data indicated that the pudendal nerves to the urethral and anal sphincters in the Rhesus monkey arose from the sixth and seventh <BrainRegion>lumbar spinal segments</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>first and second sacral spinal segments</BrainRegion> which are homologous to the <BrainRegion>S-1</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>S-4</BrainRegion> segments found to give innervation to these structures in the chimpanzee. The primate experiments thus indicate that the <BrainRegion>spinal</BrainRegion> origin of the pudendal nerve was more rostrally located by one segment or more than was the origin of the pelvic nerves to the urinary bladder.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>The actin network in the ciliary stalk of photoreceptors functions in the generation of new outer segment discs.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Cytochalasin D (CD) interferes with the morphogenesis of outer segment disc membrane in photoreceptors. Disruption of either the actin network in the ciliary stalk, where membrane evagination is initiated, or the actin core of the calycal processes, whose position could define the disc perimeter, could be responsible. We have attempted to determine which of these local F-actin populations is involved in membrane morphogenesis and what step in the process is actin-dependent. Biocytin accumulation in nascent discs, detected by fluorescent avidin and laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM), provided a means of labeling abnormal discs and a measure of disc membrane addition. F-actin content and distribution were assessed using fluorescent phalloidin and laser scanning confocal microscopy(LSCM) . First, we examined the effects of a range of Cytochalasin D(CD) dosages (0.1, 1.0, or 10.0 microM) on rod photoreceptors in Xenopus laevis eyecup cultures. Ectopic outgrowth of discs, evaluated by laser scanning confocal microscopy(LSCM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), occurred at each concentration. Phalloidin labeling intensified in the ciliary stalk with increasing Cytochalasin D(CD) concentration, indicating F-actin aggregation. In contrast, it diminished in the calycal processes, indicating dispersal; transmission electron microscopy(TEM) showed that calycal process collapse ensued. Disruption was evident at a lower concentration in the ciliary stalk (0.1 microM) than in the calycal processes (1.0 microM). transmission electron microscopy(TEM) confirmed that the calycal processes remained intact at 0.1 microM. Thus, Cytochalasin D(CD) &apos;s action on the ciliary stalk network is sufficient to disrupt disc morphogenesis. Second, we examined the effect of Cytochalasin D(CD) on temperature-induced acceleration of the rate of disc formation. In the absence of Cytochalasin D(CD) , a 10 degrees C temperature shift increased the disc formation rate nearly three-fold. Cytochalasin D(CD) (5 microM) caused a 94% inhibition (P &lt; 0.025) of this response; yet, the rate of membrane addition to ectopically growing discs exhibited the expected three-fold increase. Thus, Cytochalasin D(CD) 's action interferes with the generation of new discs.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>A histochemical study on the innervation of <BrainRegion>cerebral</BrainRegion> blood vessels in the bullfrog.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Specific histochemical techniques for the demonstration of catecholamine and acetylcholinesterase have been used to study the distribution of adrenergic and cholinergic nerves on the <BrainRegion>cerebral</BrainRegion> blood vessels of bullfrog, Rana catesbeiana. The adrenergic nerve meshworks on the <BrainRegion>cerebral</BrainRegion> arteries of bullfrog were less dense, had a more elongate appearance along the arterial axis as compared with those of mammals and were rather similar to those of snakes. The nerve plexuses on the <BrainRegion>cerebral</BrainRegion> carotid artery and its main branches were somewhat denser than those on the basilar artery. The most characteristic feature of innervation in the bullfrog <BrainRegion>cerebral</BrainRegion> vessels was that no acetylcholinesterase-positive fibres were observed on the extraparenchymal arteries, whereas, in all higher vertebrates investigated so far, the cerebral arteries have been found to be dually innervated although differences in the density of innervation of the two nerves may exist. This suggests that the peripheral adrenergic innervation on the cerebral blood vessels appeared earlier than the cholinergic one in the evolution of vertebrates. On the other hand, both adrenergic and acetylcholinesterase-positive fibres were observed in close contact with parenchymal arterioles and capillaries suggesting the possible existence of a dual central innervation. This feature, however, was by no means common. Thus, the central neurons have a significant influence on the <BrainRegion>cerebral</BrainRegion> circulation in the bullfrog is somewhat equivocal. Most of the pial and the parenchymal small vessels and the parenchymal capillaries exhibited a heavy acetylcholinesterase activity on the vascular walls. Although the significance of the enzyme is obscure as yet, this has to be considered in relation to the regulatory mechanism of the <BrainRegion>cerebral</BrainRegion> circulation.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Overlap in the distribution of cholinergic and catecholaminergic neurons in the <BrainRegion>upper brainstem</BrainRegion> of the ferret.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The distribution of catecholaminergic and cholinergic neurons in the <BrainRegion>upper brainstem</BrainRegion> of the ferret were mapped by staining immunohistochemically two adjacent series of sections of <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion> for tyrosine hydroxylase and choline acetyltransferase, respectively. As in other species, large numbers of tyrosine-hydroxylase-positive neurons are localized in the <BrainRegion>ventral tegmental area</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>A10</BrainRegion>), the <BrainRegion>substantia nigra</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>A9</BrainRegion>), and in <BrainRegion>A8</BrainRegion>. Tyrosine-hydroxylase-positive neurons in the <BrainRegion>dorsolateral pontine tegmentum</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>A4</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>A6</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>A7</BrainRegion>--the <BrainRegion>locus coeruleus complex</BrainRegion>) of the ferret are rather diffusely distributed, as has been observed in other carnivore species such as the cat and the dog, but unlike the cat, these cells in the ferret display a relative uniformity in size and morphology. Choline-acetyltransferase-positive neurons which extend in the ferret&apos;s <BrainRegion>pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>ventral parabrachial area</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>Ch5</BrainRegion>) are relatively large cells that stain intensely for choline acetyltransferase, and their dendrites form prominent bundles in regions where unstained fibre tracts are prevalent. Choline-acetyltransferase-positive neurons distributed in the <BrainRegion>laterodorsal tegmental nucleus</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>Ch6</BrainRegion>) are smaller than the cholinergic cells of Ch5, and they stain less intensely for choline acetyltransferase. Rostrally, there is little overlap between the catecholaminergic cell groups <BrainRegion>A8</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>A9</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>A10</BrainRegion> and the cholinergic cell groups of <BrainRegion>Ch5</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>Ch6</BrainRegion>. Caudally, the <BrainRegion>Ch5</BrainRegion> neurons extend some considerable extent into the <BrainRegion>locus coeruleus complex</BrainRegion>. In the region of overlap, no cells with staining for both tyrosine hydroxylase and choline acetyltransferase were observed, as was ascertained with a double staining method employing a combination of tyrosine hydroxylase immunofluorescence and choline acetyltransferase peroxidase-antiperoxidase immunohistochemistry. In conclusion, the ferret has a typically carnivore pattern for the distribution of catecholaminergic cells in the <BrainRegion>upper brainstem</BrainRegion>, and there is a significant overlap between the catecholaminergic and cholinergic cell groups in the <BrainRegion>dorsolateral pontine tegmentum</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Representation pattern in the <BrainRegion>second somatic sensory area</BrainRegion> of the monkey <BrainRegion>cerebral cortex</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The body representation in the <BrainRegion>second somatic sensory area</BrainRegion> of macaques has been studied by tracing with anatomical techniques the projections from defined parts of the body representation in the <BrainRegion>first somatic sensory area</BrainRegion> (SI) to their terminal regions within the <BrainRegion>lateral sulcus</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>second somatic sensory area</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>SH</BrainRegion>), as identified in terms of cytoarchitecture and its connection with the <BrainRegion>thalamic ventrobasal complex</BrainRegion>, is the only region of the <BrainRegion>lateral sulcus</BrainRegion> to receive a projection from <BrainRegion>somatic sensory area</BrainRegion>(SI) . The nearby <BrainRegion>retroinsular area</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>area 7b</BrainRegion> receive a projection from <BrainRegion>area 5</BrainRegion>. Within <BrainRegion>somatic sensory area(SI) I</BrainRegion> the face and head representations lie anteriorly, occupying the <BrainRegion>dorsalmost part of the insula</BrainRegion> and portions of the <BrainRegion>front-parietal operculum</BrainRegion>. The digits, hand, and arm are represented posterior to the face and may take up the <BrainRegion>mediolateral extent of the parietal operculum</BrainRegion> in the region immediately in front of the <BrainRegion>posterior pole of the insula</BrainRegion>. The trunk representation is lateral to the arm representation, i.e., <BrainRegion>deep within the superior circular sulcus</BrainRegion> and on the <BrainRegion>dorsal insula</BrainRegion>. The hindlimb appears behind the trunk also occupying the <BrainRegion>superior circular sulcus</BrainRegion> in addition to the deepest 2--3 mm of the upper bank of <BrainRegion>lateral sulcus</BrainRegion> immediately posterior to the <BrainRegion>insula</BrainRegion>. <BrainRegion>Areas 3b, 1, and 2</BrainRegion> each project to <BrainRegion>somatic sensory area(SI) I</BrainRegion>, and their projections appear to converge within the representation of a given body part. Injections of anterogradely transported tracers in <BrainRegion>somatic sensory area</BrainRegion>(SI) label vertically oriented columnar arrays of a terminal ramifications in <BrainRegion>somatic sensory area(SI) I</BrainRegion>, resembling those previously described for other cortico-cortical projections within the <BrainRegion>sensory-motor region</BrainRegion>. In experiments which combined anterograde and retrograde labeling, cells projecting from <BrainRegion>somatic sensory area(SI) I</BrainRegion> to <BrainRegion>somatic sensory area</BrainRegion>(SI) formed columns exactly coinciding with the columns of anterogradely labeled axons terminating in <BrainRegion>SH</BrainRegion>. The cells of origin of cortico-cortical projections emanating from <BrainRegion>somatic sensory area(SI) I</BrainRegion> formed two distinct laminar populations, one in the supragranular layers and the second mainly in layer VI. There is evidence for fiber terminations within the layer VI mainly underlying the column formed by the terminal ramifications in layers I and through IV.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Heterogeneity of GABAA receptor in goldfish <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The possibility of GABAA receptor heterogeneity in goldfish <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> was studied with immunocytochemical and biochemical approaches: 1) immunoblotted membrane particulates of goldfish <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> with mAb 62-3G1; 2) immunoprecipitation of the detergent-solubilized membrane proteins with mAb 62-3G1 followed by the receptor binding assay; 3) photoaffinity labeling of the membrane particulates with 3H-flunitrazepam (FNZ) and visualization of the labeled receptors by SDS-PAGE and fluorography; 4) dry autoradiography of 3H-muscimol and 3H- 3H-flunitrazepam(FNZ) binding sites on frozen sections. Immunoblots showed that 62-3G1 reacted with 55-57.5 kDa M(r) polypeptides, similar to the muscimol-binding subunit of the receptor complex in bovine brain; while 3H- 3H-flunitrazepam(FNZ) photoaffinity labeled the 52.5 kDa and 41-43 kDa M(r) polypeptides. Immunoprecipitated receptors bound only 3H-muscimol, not 3H- 3H-flunitrazepam(FNZ) . An attempt to precipitate the 3H- 3H-flunitrazepam(FNZ) photolabeled polypeptides failed. Dry autoradiography showed 3H- 3H-flunitrazepam(FNZ) binding only in the inner plexiform layer (IPL); the binding was enhanced with gamma-aminobutyric acid ( gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) ) and blocked by clonazepam. In contrast, 3H-muscimol was bound in both the outer plexiform layer (OPL) and inner plexiform layer(IPL) , similar to that observed with 62-3G1 immunocytochemistry. We suggest that there are two subtypes of gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) A receptor in the goldfish <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>: 1) gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) A receptors that are not linked to a benzodiazepine (BZD) receptor are located in the outer plexiform layer(OPL) and at amacrine-to-amacrine and amacrine-to-ganglion cell synapses in the inner plexiform layer(IPL) and are recognized by 62-3G1; 2) gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) A receptors that are linked to a benzodiazepine(BZD) receptor are located only in the inner plexiform layer(IPL) , largely at amacrine-to-bipolar cell synapses and are not recognized by mAb 62-3G1.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Developmental expression of the prothoracicotropic hormone in the CNS of the tobacco hornworm Manduca sexta.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The prothoracicotropic hormone is an insect neuropeptide released into the hemolymph to signal molting and metamorphosis through its stimulation of steroidogenesis. The only known source of the prothoracicotropic hormone in the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta, has been a group of <BrainRegion>lateral cerebral</BrainRegion> neurosecretory cells, the L-NSC III. In this study, the developmental and spatial distribution of the prothoracicotropic hormone was examined throughout the life cycle of Manduca. In common with many vertebrates and invertebrates in which neuropeptides are located in several regions within the central nervous system (CNS), the prothoracicotropic hormone phenotype in Manduca is expressed by central nervous system(CNS) neurons in addition to the L-NSC III. These neurons are located in the brain, frontal ganglion, and subesophageal ganglion. One <BrainRegion>cerebral</BrainRegion> neurosecretory cell group, the ventromedial neurons, expresses the prothoracicotropic hormone phenotype and the behavioral neurohormone, eclosion hormone. Whereas the L-NSC III and the ventromedial neurons express the peptide phenotype throughout the life cycle, the other neurons express the peptide only during the embryonic and larval stages. This precise spatial and temporal expression of the prothoracicotropic hormone by different groups of neurosecretory cells raises the possibility that in Manduca the peptide may, in addition to its known neuroendocrine function, play other physiological roles in different ways at different stages of the life cycle.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>A new look at calretinin-immunoreactive amacrine cell types in the monkey <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>We have examined amacrine cells that are calretinin-immunoreactive (-IR) in the macaque monkey <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> with the aim of classifying them into morphological and functional subtypes. There are calretinin-IR cells in the <BrainRegion>fovea</BrainRegion> and throughout the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>. Their highest density is reached at 1.0 mm from the <BrainRegion>foveal pit</BrainRegion> (10500 cells/mm(2)) and falls to 2600/mm(2) by 10 mm of eccentricity. Nearest-neighbor statistics for the calretinin-IR cell body distribution indicate a nonregular pattern, with a regularity index of 1.4-1.6. There is an increase or &quot;bump" of cell density 3.5-4.0 mm from the <BrainRegion>foveal pit</BrainRegion>, corresponding to the rod photoreceptor density peak. Based on morphological differences, there appear to be three types of amacrine cell that are calretinin-IR. To determine the types, we doubly immunolabeled <BrainRegion>retinas</BrainRegion>, from <BrainRegion>fovea</BrainRegion> to periphery, for calretinin-IR in combination with other calcium binding proteins and inhibitory amino acid neurotransmitters. Labeling with parvalbumin and calretinin antibodies indicated that 70% of the amacrine cells were solely calretinin-IR, and 30% contained parvalbumin-IR as well. In the same way, 70% of the calretinin-IR amacrine cells colocalized calbindin, but 30% were only calretinin-IR. Among the calretinin/calbindin-colocalized cells, there were small-field and wide-field types. Double labeling with antibodies to calretinin and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and to calretinin and glycine revealed the majority to be glycine-IR, but some were gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) -IR. The glycine-IR population consists mainly of AII amacrine cell types, but clearly another non-AII type is involved. The non-AII glycine-IR population resembles a small- to medium-field diffuse type. The calretinin-IR wide-field type is gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) ergic and corresponds to an A19 type. The central, rod-free, fovea contains the calretinin-IR, non-AII glycine-IR type and the calretinin-IR, gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) ergic type only. To learn more concerning the circuitry of the calretinin/glycine-IR, non-AII amacrine cell type in isolation from AII amacrine cells, we concentrated on the rod-free <BrainRegion>fovea</BrainRegion>, where AII amacrine cells are absent. We performed a serial section electron microscopy (EM) study on four calretinin-IR cells. They were involved with cone pathway circuitry. They got input from ON and OFF midget bipolar cells, reciprocated synapses to these bipolar cells, and provided synapses to ON-center ganglion cells. Thus we have obtained new information on a cone pathway amacrine cell of the central monkey <BrainRegion>fovea</BrainRegion> that is involved in the midget system.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Developmental changes in the spatial pattern of <BrainRegion>mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus</BrainRegion> (Mes5) neuron populations in the developing chick <BrainRegion>optic tectum</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The developing <BrainRegion>mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>nucleus of the fifth cranial nerve</BrainRegion>; Mes5) is composed of four neuron populations: 1) the medial group, located at the <BrainRegion>tectal commissure</BrainRegion>; 2) the lateral group distributed along the <BrainRegion>optic tectum</BrainRegion> hemispheres; 3) a group outside the <BrainRegion>neural tube</BrainRegion>; and 4) a population located at the <BrainRegion>posterior commissure</BrainRegion>. The present work aims to elucidate the site of appearance, temporal evolution, and spatial distribution of the four <BrainRegion>Mes5</BrainRegion> populations during development. According to detailed qualitative observations <BrainRegion>Mes5</BrainRegion> neurons appear as a primitive unique population along a thin <BrainRegion>dorsal medial band of the mesencephalon</BrainRegion>. According to quantitative analyses (changes in cell density along defined reference axes performed as a function of time and space), the definitive spatial pattern of <BrainRegion>Mes5</BrainRegion> neurons results from a process of differential cell movements along the tangential plane of the <BrainRegion>tectal hemispheres</BrainRegion>. Radial migration does not have a relevant developmental role. Segregation of medial and lateral group populations depends on the intensity of the lateral displacements. The mesenchymal population appears as an outsider subset of neurons that migrate from the <BrainRegion>cephalic third of the neural tube dorsal midregion</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>mesenchymal compartment</BrainRegion>. This process, together with the intensive lateral displacements that the insider subset undergoes, contributes to the disappearance of this transient population. We cannot find evidence indicating that <BrainRegion>neural crest</BrainRegion>-derived precursors enter the neural tube and differentiate into Mes5 neurons. Our results can be better interpreted in terms of the notion that a <BrainRegion>dorsal neural tube</BrainRegion> progenitor cell population behaves as precursor of both migrating peripheral descendants (<BrainRegion>neural crest</BrainRegion>) and intrinsic neurons (<BrainRegion>Mes5</BrainRegion>).</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Dopamine depletion causes fragmented clustering of neurons in the <BrainRegion>sensorimotor striatum</BrainRegion>: evidence of lasting reorganization of corticostriatal input.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Firing during sensorimotor exam was used to categorize single neurons in the lateral striatum of awake, unrestrained rats. Five rats received unilateral injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) into the medial forebrain bundle to deplete <BrainRegion>striatal</BrainRegion> dopamine ( dopamine(DA) ; &amp;gt;98% depletion, postmortem assay). Three months after treatment, rats exhibited exaggerated rotational behavior induced by L-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) and contralateral sensory neglect. Electrode track "depth profiles" on the dopamine(DA) -depleted side showed fragmented clustering of neurons related to sensorimotor activity of single body parts (SBP neurons). Clusters were smaller than normal, and more SBP neurons were observed in isolation, outside of clusters. More body parts were represented per unit volume. No recovery in these measures was observed up to one year post lesion. Overall distributions of neurons related to different body parts were not altered. The fragmentation of SBP clusters after dopamine(DA) depletion indicates that a percentage of <BrainRegion>striatal</BrainRegion> SBP neurons switched responsiveness from one body part to one or more different body parts. Because the specific firing that characterizes <BrainRegion>striatal</BrainRegion> SBP neurons is mediated by corticostriatal inputs (Liles and Updyke [1985] Brain Res. 339:245-255), the data indicate that dopamine(DA) depletion resulted in a reorganization of corticostriatal connections, perhaps via unmasking or sprouting of connections to adjacent clusters of <BrainRegion>striatal</BrainRegion> neurons. After reorganization, sensory activity in a localized body part activates <BrainRegion>striatal</BrainRegion> neurons that have switched to that body part. In turn, switched signals sent from <BrainRegion>basal ganglia</BrainRegion> to premotor and motor neurons, which likely retain their original connections, would create mismatches in these normally precise topographic connections. Switched signals could partially explain parkinsonian deficits in motor functions involving somatosensory guidance and their intractability to L-dihydroxyphenylalanine(L-DOPA) therapy-particularly if the switching involves sprouting.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Sources of <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> inputs to opossum <BrainRegion>mediodorsal nucleus</BrainRegion> identified by horseradish peroxidase and autoradiographic methods.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Some sources of <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> input to the opossum <BrainRegion>mediodorsal thalamic nucleus</BrainRegion> (MD) were identified by retrograde horseradish peroxidase and anterograde autoradiographic methods. One major source originated from the <BrainRegion>olfactory tubercle</BrainRegion> and a narrow strip of <BrainRegion>piriform cortex</BrainRegion> bordering the <BrainRegion>tubercle</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>tubercle- mediodorsal thalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>(MD) projection exhibited a definite spatial organization and included all except the most <BrainRegion>medial part of mediodorsal thalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>(MD) . The fact that the projection reached the <BrainRegion>most lateral and ventral extent of mediodorsal thalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>(MD) abutting the <BrainRegion>intralaminar complex</BrainRegion> suggests that the entire opossum <BrainRegion>mediodorsal thalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>(MD) may correspond to only the <BrainRegion>medial, magnocellular division</BrainRegion> in the primate and that the equivalents of both the <BrainRegion>parvocellular and paralamellar divisions</BrainRegion> may be absent.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Localization of the Slack potassium channel in the rat central nervous system.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The Slack gene encodes a voltage-dependent K(+) channel that has a unitary conductance of approximately 60 pS. Evidence from heterologous expression studies suggests that Slack channel subunits can also combine with the Slo subunit to generate Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels of larger conductances. Nonetheless, the function of Slack in the brain remains to be identified. We have now generated an affinity-purified antibody against the N-terminal of rat Slack, for biochemical and immunohistochemical studies. The antibody recognized Slack in transiently transfected CHO cells both by immunocytochemistry and by Western blot analysis. The antibody also detected a single band in rat brain membranes. The localization of Slack in rat brain slices was then determined using the antibody. Most prominent Slack immunoreactivity occurs in the <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion>, in particular the trigeminal system and <BrainRegion>reticular formation</BrainRegion>, where very intense staining was found in both cell bodies and axonal fibers of associated nuclei. Labeling was also very strong in the <BrainRegion>vestibular and oculomotor nuclei</BrainRegion>. Within the <BrainRegion>auditory system</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>medial nucleus of the trapezoid</BrainRegion> had a robust signal consistent with staining of the giant presynaptic terminals. Strong Slack immunoreactivity was present in the <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>red nucleus</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>deep cerebellar nuclei</BrainRegion>. There was labeling also in the <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>substantia nigra</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>amygdala</BrainRegion>. The only <BrainRegion>cortical region</BrainRegion> in which Slack immunoreactivity was detected was the <BrainRegion>frontal cortex</BrainRegion>. The subcellular and regional distribution of Slack differs from that previously reported for the Slo channel subunit and suggests that Slack may also have an autonomous role in regulating the firing properties of neurons.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Correlating gamma-aminobutyric acidergic circuits and sensory function in the <BrainRegion>electrosensory lateral line lobe</BrainRegion> of a gymnotiform fish.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Electric fish generate an electric field, which they sense with cutaneous electroreceptors. Electroreceptors project topographically onto the <BrainRegion>medullary electrosensory lateral line lobe</BrainRegion> (ELL). The <BrainRegion>electrosensory lateral line lobe</BrainRegion>(ELL) of gymnotiform electric fish is divided into four segments specialized to detect different aspects of the electrosensory input; it is also laminated with separate laminae devoted to electroreceptive input, interneurons, projection neurons, and feedback input. We have utilized antisera to glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) to map the distribution of gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) ergic cells and fibers in the <BrainRegion>electrosensory lateral line lobe</BrainRegion>(ELL) of the gymnotiform fish, Apteronotus leptorhynchus. Six types of gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) ergic interneurons are found in <BrainRegion>electrosensory lateral line lobe</BrainRegion>(ELL) : Type 2 granular cells (granular layer) project to pyramidal cells; polymorphic cells (pyramidal cell layer) project to the non- gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) ergic type 1 granular cells; ovoid cells (deep neuropil layer) project bilaterally upon basilar dendrites of pyramidal cells; multipolar cells (deep neuropil layer) project bilaterally, probably to dendrites and neurons within the deep neuropil layer; and neurons of the ventral molecular layer and stellate cells (molecular layer) project to apical dendrites of pyramidal cells. gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) ergic bipolar cells in the <BrainRegion>nucleus praeminentialis</BrainRegion>, a <BrainRegion>rhombencephalic structure</BrainRegion> devoted to feedback in the electrosensory system, project in relatively diffuse fashion to pyramidal cells. We hypothesize that the various gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) ergic circuits of the <BrainRegion>electrosensory lateral line lobe</BrainRegion>(ELL) can be correlated with specific functions: type 2 granular cells with adaptation, size of receptive field center, and gain; polymorphic cells and type 1 granular cells with regulation of surround inhibition; ovoid cells with common mode rejection; and neurons of the ventral molecular layer with adaptive gain control. The feedback gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) ergic input from bipolar cells of n. praeminentialis to pyramidal cells may be part of a searchlight mechanism similar to the one postulated for thalamocortical systems.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Inhibitory synaptic input to identified rubrospinal neurons in Macaca fascicularis: an electron microscopic study using a combined immuno-GABA-gold technique and the retrograde transport of WGA-HRP.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Rubrospinal neurons of the <BrainRegion>magnocellular division of the red nucleus</BrainRegion> of Macaca fascicularis were retrogradely labeled following <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> microinjections of wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase, as demonstrated by the chromagen tetramethylbenzidine, identifying the <BrainRegion>mesencephalic</BrainRegion> cells of origin of this descending motor pathway. The tissue was processed for electron microscopy and subsequently tested on the electron microscope grid for immunoreactivity of gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) in presumed local circuit neuronal somata, in dendrites, and in axonal terminals. Results demonstrate the presence of retrogradely labeled rubrospinal neurons of medium and large diameters (30-90 microns) and immunoreactive neurons of small size (less than 20 microns in diameter) within the nucleus. In addition, there are substantial numbers of gamma aminobutyric acid(GABA) ergic, presumably inhibitory, synaptic structures contacting somata and primary, medium, and small sized dendrites, as well as spineheads of rubrospinal neurons. The immunoreactive presynaptic profiles exhibit two different morphological appearances: one axonal and the other dendritic. Axonal terminals contain densely packed pleomorphic to flattened vesicles and form primarily symmetrical synapses with somata and all regions of the dendritic arbor. gamma aminobutyric acid(GABA) ergic profiles resembling presynaptic dendrites (PSDs) are also present. These profiles possess scattered flattened to pleomorphic synaptic vesicles in a translucent cytoplasm and are often postsynaptic to axonal terminals of unknown origin, or to gamma aminobutyric acid(GABA) ergic profiles. gamma aminobutyric acid(GABA) ergic local circuit neurons (LCNs), the neurites of which remain within the confines of the nucleus, appear to be contacted primarily by cortical and cerebellar afferents. These local circuit neurons(LCNs) may or may not possess axons and thus may represent both the source of the gamma aminobutyric acid(GABA) ergic axonal terminals as well as that of the presynaptic dendrites(PSDs) . Inhibitory afferents from other sources, such as the mesencephalic reticular formation, may also account for gamma aminobutyric acid(GABA) ergic terminals involved in this inhibition. We propose that the level of excitability of rubrospinal neurons and their subsequent activation of <BrainRegion>spinal</BrainRegion> motor neurons and interneurons is significantly regulated by the local circuit gamma aminobutyric acid(GABA) ergic inhibitory interneuronal population of the nucleus proper and probably by axons entering the nucleus from an extranuclear source.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>The shapes and numbers of amacrine cells: matching of photofilled with Golgi-stained cells in the rabbit <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> and comparison with other mammalian species.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Amacrine cells of the rabbit <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> were studied by &quot;photofilling" a photochemical method in which a fluorescent product is created within an individual cell by focal irradiation of the nucleus; and by Golgi impregnation. The photofilling method is quantitative, allowing an estimate of the frequency of the cells. The Golgi method shows their morphology in better detail. The photofilled sample consisted of 261 cells that were imaged digitally in through-focus series from a previous study (MacNeil and Masland [1998] Neuron 20:971-982). The Golgi material consisted of 49 <BrainRegion>retinas</BrainRegion> that were stained as wholemounts. Eleven of these subsequently were cut in vertical section. Of the many hundreds of cells stained, digital through-focus series were recorded for 208 of the Golgi-impregnated cells. The two methods were found to confirm one another: Most cells revealed by photofilling were recognized easily by Golgi staining, and vice versa. The greater resolution of the Golgi method allowed a more precise description of the cells and several types of amacrine cell were redefined. Two new types were identified. The two methods, taken together, provide an essentially complete accounting of the populations of amacrine cells present in the rabbit <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>. Many of them correspond to amacrine cells that have been described in other mammalian species, and these homologies are reviewed.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Morphology of normal and deafferented neurons in the chick <BrainRegion>ectomamillary nucleus</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Neurons in the <BrainRegion>ectomamillary nucleus</BrainRegion> (EMN) undergo both atrophy and cell death following eye removal at hatching. It is not known whether all <BrainRegion>ectomamillary nucleus</BrainRegion>(EMN) neurons are affected uniformly by transneuronal atrophy or whether cell loss is an artifact due to misidentification of atrophied neurons as glia. In a preliminary morphological study, four types of neurons were found in the <BrainRegion>ectomamillary nucleus</BrainRegion>(EMN) by using the rapid Golgi method: A large multipolar neuron (type I); two medium-sized spindle-shaped neurons, one possessing many dendritic branches (type II) and the other possessing few dendritic branches (type III); and a small round neuron (type IV). Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was then injected into two of the <BrainRegion>ectomamillary nucleus</BrainRegion>(EMN) projection fields in enucleated chicks in order to label retrogradely as many <BrainRegion>ectomamillary nucleus</BrainRegion>(EMN) neurons as possible. Types, I, II, and III neurons were identified both in the control and experimental <BrainRegion>ectomamillary nucleus</BrainRegion>(EMN) . The three types of backfilled neurons showed different degrees of transneuronal atrophy ranging from 12 to 47%. The type IV neuron, which could not be backfilled, was inferred to atrophy by 33%. Substantial differences in transneuronal atrophy, therefore, exist among the different types of neurons within the same nucleus. Since no glialike neurons could be retrogradely labeled it was concluded that there is a true neuron loss in the <BrainRegion>ectomamillary nucleus</BrainRegion>(EMN) following eye removal rather than mistaken identification of neurons as glia.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Hair cell innervation by spiral ganglion neurons in the mouse.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was injected extracellularly into the <BrainRegion>auditory nerve</BrainRegion> of adult mice so that the enzyme could infuse individual spiral ganglion neurons. Forty-two well-stained neurons were reconstructed through serial sections from their cell bodies to peripheral terminations in the <BrainRegion>organ of Corti</BrainRegion> with the aid of a light microscope and drawing tube. No neuron was observed to innervate both inner and outer hair cells (IHCs and OHCs). Previous observations from neonatal mammals that reported that IHCs and OHCs were innervated by the same neuron are thus presumed to describe a transient developmental phenomenon. Two populations of spiral ganglion neurons were determined on the basis of the differences in receptor innervation. The type I neurons innervated exclusively IHCs by way of thick (1-2 microns) radial fibers, whereas the type II neurons innervated only OHCs by way of thin (approximately 0.5 micron) outer spiral fibers. Certain features of the peripheral process in the vicinity of the cell body were highly correlated with fiber type. This pattern of separate innervation of IHCs and OHCs by type I and type II neurons, respectively, may represent the general plan of afferent organization for the adult mammalian cochlea.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Subicular</BrainRegion> efferents are organized mostly as parallel projections: a double-labeling, retrograde-tracing study in the rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>To understand the functional relevance of the <BrainRegion>subiculum</BrainRegion> as a major distributor of <BrainRegion>hippocampally</BrainRegion> processed information, detailed information about its neuronal organization is necessary. A striking feature of the <BrainRegion>subiculum</BrainRegion> is that it can be divided into four different areas, each characterized by a specific set of efferent connections. To establish whether the different areas of the <BrainRegion>subiculum</BrainRegion> are similar with respect to the organization of the origin of their respective efferents, the double-fluorescence retrograde-tracing technique was used to study the degree of collateralization. Because <BrainRegion>CA1</BrainRegion> gives rise to a major input to the <BrainRegion>subiculum</BrainRegion> but also projects to some of the targets reached by <BrainRegion>subicular</BrainRegion> projections, we compared the <BrainRegion>subicular</BrainRegion> degree of collateralization with that of <BrainRegion>CA1</BrainRegion>. Throughout <BrainRegion>CA1</BrainRegion>, the percentages of double-labeled cells were high, ranging from 17% to 39%. In contrast, the percentages of double-labeled cells in the <BrainRegion>subiculum</BrainRegion> were much lower, ranging from 0% to 12%, and no differences were noted between the four areas of the <BrainRegion>subiculum</BrainRegion>. This indicates that the four regions of the <BrainRegion>subiculum</BrainRegion> are organized in the same way with regard to the output connectivity. Because all four different regions of the <BrainRegion>subiculum</BrainRegion> share this paucity of collateralized projections, we conclude that <BrainRegion>subicular</BrainRegion> outputs generally originate as parallel projections. This characteristic organization is in line with a proposed function of the <BrainRegion>subiculum</BrainRegion> in information storage.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Light and dark cells of rat vallate taste buds are morphologically distinct cell types.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Cells of mammalian taste buds have been classified into morphological types based on ultrastructural criteria, but investigators have disagreed as to whether these are distinct cell types or the extremes of a continuum. To address this issue, we examined taste buds from rat vallate papillae that had been sectioned transversely, rather than longitudinally, to their longest axis. In these transverse sections, dark (Type I) and light (Type II) cells were easily distinguished by their relative electron density, shape and topological relationships. Cells with electron-lucent cytoplasm (light cells) were circular or oval in outline, while those with electron-dense cytoplasm (dark cells) had an irregular outline with sheetlike cytoplasmic projections that separated adjacent light cells. A hierarchical cluster analysis of 314 cells across five morphological parameters (cell shape and area, and nuclear ellipticity, electron density and invagination) revealed two distinct groups of cells, which largely corresponded to the dark and light cells identified visually. These cells were not continuously distributed within a principal components factor solution. Differences in the means for dark and light cells were highly significant for each morphological parameter, but within either cell type, changes in one parameter correlated little with changes in any other. These analyses all failed to reveal cells with a consistent set of intermediate characteristics, suggesting that dark and light cells of rat vallate taste buds are distinct cell types rather than extremes of a continuum. Sections of taste buds were stained with antibodies to several carbohydrates, then observed by indirect immunofluorescence. Optical sections taken with a confocal laser-scanning microscope showed that the Lewis antigen was present only on spindle-shaped cells with circular or oval outlines and lacking transverse projections; these characteristic shapes matched those of light cells seen by electron microscopy. The H blood group antigen and the 2B8 epitope appeared at most cell-cell interfaces in the bud and are present on dark cells and possibly on some light cells. These findings relate molecular markers to morphological phenotypes and should facilitate future studies of taste cell turnover, development and regeneration.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>A Golgi study of the short-axon interneurons of the cell layer and inner plexiform layer of the <BrainRegion>medial cortex</BrainRegion> of the lizard Podarcis hispanica.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The <BrainRegion>medial cortex</BrainRegion> of lizards is a three-layered brain region displaying cyto- and chemoarchitectonical, connectional, and ontogenetic characteristics that relate it to the <BrainRegion>hippocampal fascia dentata</BrainRegion> of mammals. Three interneuron types located in the cell layer and ten others in the inner plexiform layer (six in the juxtasomatic zone and four in the deep zone) are described in this study. The granuloid neurons, web-axon neurons, and deep-fusiform neurons lay within the cell layer. These neurons were scarce; they were probably gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-, and parvalbumin-immunoreactive and presumably participated in feed forward as well as in feed back inhibition of the principal projection cells of the lizard <BrainRegion>medial cortex</BrainRegion>. In the juxtasomatic inner plexiform layer, the smooth vertical neurons, smooth horizontal neurons, small radial neurons, large radial neurons, pyramidal-like radial neurons, and spheroidal neurons were found. They were all probably gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) -, and parvalbumin-immunoreactive and were involved in feed forward inhibition of principal <BrainRegion>medial cortex</BrainRegion> cells. In the deep inner plexiform layer lay the giant-multipolar neurons, long-spined polymorphic neurons, periventricular neurons, and alveus-horizontal neurons. These neurons were probably gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) -immunoreactive and either neuropeptide- (somatostatin-neuropeptide Y) or parvalbumin-immunoreactive. They seemed to be involved in feed back or even occasionally in feed forward inhibition phenomena.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>The connective tissue coverings of leech peripheral nerves: anatomical evidence for the absence of <BrainRegion>cerebrospinal fluid</BrainRegion> in the leech.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The central nervous system of Hirudo medicinalis is contained within a blood vessel, the <BrainRegion>ventral longitudinal sinus</BrainRegion>, but the nervous system is separated from the blood by the visceral endothelium. The visceral endothelium possesses many pinocytotic vesicles and basal infoldings and thus appears active whereas the parietal endothelium appears inactive. The junction between the visceral and parietal endothelia is abrupt. Peripheral nerves in this animal, as in vertebrates, are covered by endoneurium, perineurium, and epineurium. The endoneurium is continous with the fibrous tissue of the segmental ganglia. The perineurium, consisting of a single layer of flattened cells that surrounds the peripheral nerve like a sleeve, is not continuous with the endothelium of the ventral sinus, but is separated from it by 5-10 microns. Therefore, at the point where the peripheral nerve joins the segmental ganglion, the extracellular spaces of the central nervous system, the peripheral nervous system, and the body wall are all confluent. Thus, there are only two compartments of the extracellular space in the leech: the blood, which is enclosed by the endothelia of the coelomic sinuses, and the extracellular fluid of the body, which includes the extracellular fluid of the nervous system. There seems to be no equivalent of <BrainRegion>cerebrospinal fluid</BrainRegion> in the gnathobdellid leech.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Ommatidial type-specific interphotoreceptor connections in the lamina of the swallowtail butterfly, Papilio xuthus.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The eye of the butterfly Papilio xuthus contains a random array of three types of ommatidia (types I-III), each bearing nine photoreceptors, R1-R9. Of the six spectral classes of photoreceptors identified, types I, II, and III ommatidia contain four, three, and two classes, respectively: the ommatidia are thus spectrally heterogeneous. The photoreceptors send their axons to the lamina where, together with some large monopolar cells (LMCs), the nine from a single ommatidium contribute to a module called a lamina cartridge. We recently reported that among different photoreceptor axon terminals visualized by confocal microscopy, the number and length of axon collaterals differ for different spectral receptors, suggesting that lamina circuits are specific for each ommatidial type. Here we studied the distribution of synapse-like structures in the cartridges, first characterizing a photoreceptor by measuring its spectral sensitivity and then injecting Lucifer yellow (LY). We subsequently histologically identified the type of ommatidium to which the injected photoreceptor belonged, cut serial ultrathin sections of the entire lamina, labeled these with anti- Lucifer yellow(LY) immunocytochemistry, and then localized synapse-like structures. We found numerous interphotoreceptor contacts both within and between cartridges, the combination of which was again specific for the ommatidial type. R3 and R4, which are green-sensitive photoreceptors in all ommatidia, have thick axons lacking collaterals. We found that these cells exclusively make contacts with large monopolar cells(LMCs) and not with photoreceptors. We therefore presume that R3 and R4 construct a system for motion vision, whereas other randomly distributed spectral types provide inputs for color vision.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Globose basal cells are required for reconstitution of <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> epithelium after methyl bromide lesion.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Despite a remarkable regenerative capacity, recovery of the mammalian <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> epithelium can fail in severely injured areas, which subsequently reconstitute as aneuronal respiratory epithelium (metaplasia). We contrasted the cellular response of areas of the rat epithelium that recover as <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> after methyl bromide lesion with those undergoing respiratory metaplasia in order to identify stem cells that restore lesioned epithelium as <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion>. Ventral olfactory epithelium is at particular risk for metaplasia after lesion and patches of it are rendered acellular by methyl bromide exposure. In contrast, globose basal cells (GBCs, marked by staining with GBC-2) are preserved in surrounding ventral areas and uniformly throughout dorsal epithelium, which consistently and completely recovers as <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> after lesion. Over the next few days, neurons reappear, but only in those areas in which globose basal cells(GBCs) are preserved and multiply. In contrast, parts of the epithelium in which globose basal cells(GBCs) are destroyed are repopulated in part by Bowman&apos;s gland cells, which pile up above the basal lamina. Electron microscopy confirms the reciprocity between gland cells and globose basal cells. By 14 days after lesion, the areas that are undergoing metaplasia are repopulated by typical respiratory epithelial cells. As horizontal basal cells are eliminated from all parts of the ventral epithelium, the data suggest that GBC-2(+) cells are ultimately responsible for regenerating <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> neuroepithelium. In contrast, GLA-13(+) cells may give rise to respiratory metaplastic epithelium where globose basal cells(GBCs) are eliminated. Thus, we support the idea that a subpopulation of globose basal cells(GBCs) is the neural stem cell of the <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> epithelium.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Distribution and effects of tachykinin-like peptides in the stomatogastric nervous system of the crab, Cancer borealis.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The rhythmically active pyloric and gastric mill motor patterns in the stomatogastric ganglion of the crab, Cancer borealis, are influenced by modulatory projection neurons whose somata are located primarily in the other ganglia of the stomatogastric nervous system. One of these projection neurons exhibits substance P-like immunolabeling. However, bath application of substance P does not influence these motor patterns. To determine whether a different peptide is responsible for the substance P-like immunolabeling, we studied the presence and physiological effects of the locustatachykinins and the leucokinins, two families of tachykinin-like peptides originally identified in insect nervous systems. Locustatachykinin-like immunolabeling has the same distribution in the stomatogastric nervous system as substance P-like immunolabeling and colocalizes with it in the majority of immunopositive structures. Preincubation of locustatachykinin antibody with substance P, and preincubation of substance P antibody with locustatachykinin, blocks subsequent immunolabeling in the stomatogastric nervous system. In contrast, we found no leucokinin-like immunolabeling in this system. Bath application to the stomatogastric ganglion of individual locustatachykinins or leucokinins excited the pyloric rhythm in a state-dependent manner. Each peptide family had distinct effects on the pyloric rhythm. Thus, both of these tachykinin-like peptide families are likely related to native neuropeptides that influence the pyloric rhythm. Furthermore, a member of the locustatachykinin family is likely to be the source of the previously identified substance P-like immunoreactivity in the stomatogastric nervous system.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Immunohistochemical localization of serotoninergic, enkephalinergic, and catecholaminergic cells in the <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>diencephalon</BrainRegion> of a cartilaginous fish, Hydrolagus colliei.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>We localized serotonin (5-HT), leu-enkephalin (LENK), and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunoreactive cells in the brain of a holocephalian, Hydrolagus colliei, by use of antibodies made in rabbit and the peroxidase-antiperoxidase technique. Only three locations contained tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) + cells, the <BrainRegion>caudal myelencephalon</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>locus coeruleus</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>diencephalon</BrainRegion>. Of these locations, the <BrainRegion>diencephalon</BrainRegion> contained the most cells and the <BrainRegion>locus coeruleus</BrainRegion> the least cells. The caudal tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) + <BrainRegion>myelencephalic</BrainRegion> cells formed a single large group that spanned both the dorsal and ventral portions of the brain (<BrainRegion>A1A2</BrainRegion>). The <BrainRegion>diencephalic</BrainRegion> tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) + cells were located in the <BrainRegion>posterior tuberculum</BrainRegion>, in the <BrainRegion>ventromedial and ventrolateral thalamic nuclei</BrainRegion>, and in the <BrainRegion>inferior lobe of the hypothalamus</BrainRegion>. Hydrolagus differed from mammals and the elasmobranchs, their sister group, in that no <BrainRegion>substantia nigra</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>A9</BrainRegion>), <BrainRegion>ventral tegmental area</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>A10</BrainRegion>), or <BrainRegion>A5</BrainRegion> cell group was found. Distribution of leu-enkephalin(LENK) + and 5-HT+ cells were similar to each other; the <BrainRegion>raphe nuclei</BrainRegion> contained most of the 5-HT+ and leu-enkephalin(LENK) + cells. These 5-HT+ and leu-enkephalin(LENK) + cells were found at all <BrainRegion>rostrocaudal levels of the myelencephalon</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>nucleus reticularis magnocellularis</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>reticularis paragigantocellularis lateralis</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>ventral met- and mesencephalon</BrainRegion> (B7 and B9 cell groups), the <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>pretectal area</BrainRegion> contained additional 5-HT+ and leu-enkephalin(LENK) + cells. The solitary complex contained leu-enkephalin(LENK) + cells but not but 5-HT+ cells. A <BrainRegion>dorsal raphe nucleus</BrainRegion>, which is the largest 5-HT+ cell group in mammals, was absent in Hydrolagus. A <BrainRegion>dorsal raphe nucleus</BrainRegion> is present in one galeomorph shark radiation but is absent in three radiations of batoids (rays, skates, and guitarfish). Thus even within cartilaginous fish, there are differences in the distribution of neurochemicals and possibly nuclei within their brains.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Histochemical localization of cytochrome oxidase in the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>optic tectum</BrainRegion> of normal goldfish: a combined cytochrome oxidase-horseradish peroxidase study.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Cytochrome oxidase (C.O.) was histochemically localized in the normal <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>optic tectum</BrainRegion> of goldfish in order to examine the laminar and cellular oxidative metabolic organization of these structures. In the <BrainRegion>optic tectum</BrainRegion>, Cytochrome oxidase(C.O.) exhibited a distinct laminar, regional, and cellular distribution. The laminae with highest Cytochrome oxidase(C.O.) levels were those that receive <BrainRegion>optic</BrainRegion> input, suggesting a dominant role for visual activity in tectal function. This was demonstrated by colocalizing Cytochrome oxidase(C.O.) and HRP-filled optic fibers in the same section. However, the distribution of Cytochrome oxidase(C.O.) within the optic laminae was not uniform. Within the main <BrainRegion>optic</BrainRegion> layers, the SFGS, four metabolically distinct sublaminae were distinguished and designated from superficial to deep as sublaminae a, b, c, and d. The most intense reactivity was localized within SFGSa and SFGSd, followed by SFGSb, then SFGSc. In SFGSd, intense reactivity was found to occur specifically within a class of large diameter axons and terminals that were apparently <BrainRegion>optic</BrainRegion> since these were also labeled with HRP and cobaltous lysine applied to the <BrainRegion>optic nerve</BrainRegion>. Regional Cytochrome oxidase(C.O.) differences across the <BrainRegion>tectum</BrainRegion> were also noted. Low levels were found in neurons and <BrainRegion>optic terminals</BrainRegion> along the growing immature medial, lateral, and posterior edges of <BrainRegion>tectum</BrainRegion>, but were higher at the more mature anterior pole and central regions of <BrainRegion>tectum</BrainRegion>. This suggests that the oxidative metabolic activity is initially low in newly formed <BrainRegion>tectal</BrainRegion> neurons and optic axons, but gradually increases with neuronal growth and functional axon terminal maturation. Most Cytochrome oxidase(C.O.) staining was localized within neuropil, whereas the perikarya of most <BrainRegion>tectal</BrainRegion> neurons were only lightly reactive. Only a few neuron classes, mostly the relatively larger projection neurons, had darkly reactive perikarya. In the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>, intense Cytochrome oxidase(C.O.) reactivity was localized within the inner segments of photoreceptors, the inner and outer plexiform layers, and within certain classes of <BrainRegion>bipolar</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>ganglion</BrainRegion> cells. The large <BrainRegion>ganglion</BrainRegion> cells in particular were intensely reactive. Like the large diameter <BrainRegion>optic terminals</BrainRegion> in SFGSd, the large <BrainRegion>ganglion</BrainRegion> cells were preferentially filled with HRP, suggesting that they may project to <BrainRegion>tectum</BrainRegion> and are the source of the darkly reactive large diameter axons and terminals in sublamina SFGSd. We propose a new scheme to describe <BrainRegion>tectal</BrainRegion> lamination that integrates laminar differences in Cytochrome oxidase(C.O.) reactivity with classical histological work.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Aging impairs axonal sprouting response of <BrainRegion>dentate</BrainRegion> granule cells following target loss and partial deafferentation.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Compared to other brain regions, the <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion> shows considerable susceptibility to the aging process. Aging may impair the compensatory plastic response of <BrainRegion>hippocampal</BrainRegion> neurons following lesions, target loss, and/or deafferentation. We hypothesize that sprouting of <BrainRegion>dentate</BrainRegion> granule cell axons (mossy fibers) in response to target loss and partial deafferentation diminishes with age. We quantified mossy fiber sprouting into the <BrainRegion>dentate</BrainRegion> supragranular layer (DSGL) following intracerebroventricular kainic acid administration in young adult, middle-aged, and aged rats, using Timm&apos;s histochemical method. Mossy fiber ingrowth into the <BrainRegion>dentate</BrainRegion> supragranular layer(DSGL) was assessed in the <BrainRegion>septal hippocampus</BrainRegion> at 2- and 4 months postlesion by measuring both the average width and the relative density of sprouted terminals. Kainic acid lesions produced degeneration of <BrainRegion>CA3</BrainRegion> pyramids with sparing of <BrainRegion>CA1</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>dentate</BrainRegion> granule cells in all age groups. Although young adults demonstrated robust <BrainRegion>dentate</BrainRegion> supragranular layer(DSGL) mossy fiber sprouting, sprouting was significantly reduced in both middle-aged and aged rats. Compared to the case in young adults, the overall sprouting in middle-aged animals was reduced by 52% at 2 months and 50% at 4 months postlesion, whereas in aged rats the sprouting was reduced by 53% at 2 months and 64% at 4 months postlesion. Aged animals also showed an overall reduction of 28% compared to middle-aged animals at 4 months postlesion. Dramatically reduced sprouting in aged animals may represent a deficit in recognition of target loss and partial deafferentation by aged granule cells and/or an impaired up-regulation of factors that stimulate neurite outgrowth in the aged brain.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Morphometric modifications associated with early sensory experience in the rat <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>: I. Volumetric study of the <BrainRegion>bulbar</BrainRegion> layers.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Current models of sensory coding in the <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> are based on the notion of topographical specificity in the processing of stimuli. Part of this hypothesis comes from studies of patterns of radiolabelled 2-deoxyglucose uptake, and local morphometric variations of the mitral cell size observed following prolonged exposure to an odor. The present study explored the possibility that exposing young rats to a long-term stimulation with an odor would induce spatially distributed volumetric variations of the <BrainRegion>bulbar</BrainRegion> layers. Three groups of 5 rats have been studied: (1) stimulated with ethyl acetoacetate from birth to 1 month of age, (2) unilaterally deprived following early cauterization of one nostril, and (3) normal animals of same age. Fourteen frontal histological sections uniformly distributed along the <BrainRegion>rostrocaudal axis of the olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> were used for this study. Areas of the <BrainRegion>bulbar</BrainRegion> layers were measured with the aid of an image analyser and the volume of the corresponding layers deduced by computation. Following complete sensory deprivation, the volume of all <BrainRegion>bulbar</BrainRegion> layers, except the periventricular core, was homogeneously reduced along the <BrainRegion>rostrocaudal axis of the olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>. Following long-term stimulation with ethyl acetoacetate, volume reduction was significantly higher in anterior and middle regions than in the <BrainRegion>posterior part of the olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>. It is assumed that neuronal pathways activated by ethyl acetoacetate stimulation are mainly located in the <BrainRegion>posterior part of the olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>. Functional interpretations of these results are discussed with respect to the spatial dimension in olfactory coding.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Extrasynaptic localization of taurine-like immunoreactivity in the lamprey <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Taurine is an endogenous amino acid that can occur in nerve terminals in the central nervous system and that can produce inhibitory neuronal responses. It is unclear, however, whether this amino acid can function as a synaptic transmitter. To examine the distribution of taurine at high anatomical resolution in a vertebrate, light and electron microscopic immunocytochemical postembedding techniques were applied to the lamprey <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> (Ichtyomyzon unicuspis and Lampetra fluviatilis), which contains many large, unmyelinated axons. The most intense immunolabeling occurred in a population of liquor-contacting cells (tanycytes), located around the <BrainRegion>central canal</BrainRegion>, which extended processes to the dorsal, lateral, and ventral margins of the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>. In addition, a proportion of the taurine-immunoreactive cells contained gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-like immunoreactivity. A moderate level of taurine immunoreactivity was also present in ependymal cells, located around the <BrainRegion>central canal</BrainRegion>, as well as in astrocytes throughout all regions of the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>. At the ultrastructural level, the taurine immunoreactivity showed an even distribution in the cytoplasm of the labeled cells. In contrast to the glial labeling, neuronal cell bodies and axons exhibited very low levels of taurine labeling, which were similar to the level of background labeling. The synaptic vesicle clusters within the axons did not show any clear accumulation of taurine immunoreactivity. These results suggest that taurine may have metabolic roles in the lamprey <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>, and, as in other systems, it may take part in osmoregulation. However, the lack of immunolabeling in presynaptic elements is not consistent with a role of taurine as a synaptic transmitter.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>The <BrainRegion>primary vestibular</BrainRegion> projection to the <BrainRegion>cerebellar cortex</BrainRegion> in the pigeon (Columba livia).</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The <BrainRegion>cerebellar cortex</BrainRegion> of the pigeon receiving direct vestibular afferents was delineated by anterograde transport of [3H]-amino acids injected into the <BrainRegion>vestibular nerve</BrainRegion>. Labelled mossy fiber rosettes in the granular layer were concentrated in <BrainRegion>lobule X</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>nodulus</BrainRegion>) and to a lesser extent, in the <BrainRegion>ventral portion of lobule IXd</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>uvula</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>paraflocculus</BrainRegion>). A few solitary labelled rosettes were also found in more <BrainRegion>dorsal portions of lobule IX</BrainRegion>, as well as in the <BrainRegion>anterior lobe between lobule II and IV</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>lingula</BrainRegion> remained unlabelled. Discrete injections of [3H]-leucine into the cristae of each of the three <BrainRegion>semicircular canals</BrainRegion> or the <BrainRegion>utricular macula</BrainRegion> yielded a similar distribution of fewer labelled rosettes. A few primary mossy fiber terminals labelled after <BrainRegion>cochlear</BrainRegion> injections are attributed to afferents from the <BrainRegion>lagenar macula</BrainRegion>. Since effective diffusion of label from the injection site was excluded by controls, it is concluded that projection of individual canal and macula nerves to the <BrainRegion>vestibulocerebellar cortex</BrainRegion> is not topographically separated. It is proposed that this extensive convergence of various afferents is required by the <BrainRegion>cerebellum</BrainRegion> to compute precise and directionally specific control signals during head rotation in all conceivable planes.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Nigrothalamic</BrainRegion> projections and nigrothalamocortical pathway to the <BrainRegion>medial agranular cortex</BrainRegion> in the rat: single- and double-labeling light and electron microscopic studies.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Although the rat <BrainRegion>medial agranular cortex</BrainRegion> (AGm) has been implicated in a variety of motor functions, the source of the afferents impinging upon <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> neurons projecting to the Although the rat <BrainRegion>medial agranular cortex</BrainRegion>(AGm) is not directly known. The main purpose of this study was to determine whether the Although the rat <BrainRegion>medial agranular cortex</BrainRegion>(AGm) is a major recipient of the nigrothalamocortical pathway. This issue was addressed by two sets of experiments. First, the organization of the <BrainRegion>nigrothalamic</BrainRegion> projections was studied by light and electron microscopy following injections of the anterograde tracer Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) into the <BrainRegion>pars reticulata of the substantia nigra</BrainRegion> (SNR). The major finding of this study was the disclosure of a heretofore unknown projection to the <BrainRegion>rostromedial part of the ventral anterior-ventral lateral complex</BrainRegion> (VAL). This projection originates exclusively from the <BrainRegion>ventral portion of the substantia nigra</BrainRegion>(SNR) and is comparable in strength to the well-known <BrainRegion>nigrothalamic</BrainRegion> projection to the <BrainRegion>ventromedial nucleus</BrainRegion> (VM). Electron microscopic examination revealed differences in the synaptic organization of <BrainRegion>nigral</BrainRegion> terminals in the <BrainRegion>anterior-ventral lateral complex</BrainRegion>(VAL) and the <BrainRegion>ventromedial nucleus</BrainRegion>(VM) . A large proportion of the labeled terminals in the <BrainRegion>anterior-ventral lateral complex</BrainRegion>(VAL) was involved in axosomatic synapses, whereas, in the <BrainRegion>ventromedial nucleus</BrainRegion>(VM) , the axosomatic synapses were rare, and 67% of <BrainRegion>nigral</BrainRegion> terminals were found in contact with thin dendrites. To assess a possible disynaptic nigrothalamocortical pathway to the Although the <BrainRegion>rat medial agranular cortex</BrainRegion>(AGm) , a double-labeling strategy combining Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin(PHA-L) injections in the <BrainRegion>substantia nigra</BrainRegion>(SNR) and pressure injections of the retrograde tracer, cholera toxin subunit B (CTB) in the Although the <BrainRegion>rat medial agranular cortex</BrainRegion>(AGm) was employed. The greatest density of cholera toxin subunit B(CTB) -labeled neurons was found in the <BrainRegion>rostral and central portion of the anterior-ventral lateral complex</BrainRegion>(VAL) , coincident with the <BrainRegion>nigrothalamic</BrainRegion> labeling originating from the <BrainRegion>ventral substantia nigra</BrainRegion>(SNR) . Electron microscopic analysis confirmed that some of the Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin(PHA-L) -labeled terminals established synaptic contacts with the cholera toxin subunit B(CTB) -labeled cell bodies and large dendrites. In conclusion, our findings indicate that there exist two different nigrothalamocortical pathways through the <BrainRegion>motor thalamus</BrainRegion> in the rat. The <BrainRegion>substantia nigra(SNR) - anterior-ventral lateral complex</BrainRegion>(VAL) - Although the rat <BrainRegion>medial agranular cortex</BrainRegion>(AGm) cortical projection may play a role in oculomotor functions, whereas the <BrainRegion>substantia nigra(SNR) - ventromedial nucleus(VM) -cortical</BrainRegion> pathway has been implicated in arousal mechanisms.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Organization of cutaneous ventrodorsal and rostrocaudal axial lines in the rat hindlimb and trunk in the <BrainRegion>dorsal horn of the spinal cord</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The somatotopic organization of cutaneous primary afferents projecting to the <BrainRegion>dorsal horn of the rat spinal cord</BrainRegion> was investigated. The fluorescent neurotracer, 1,1&apos;-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI) was applied to cutaneous incisions made along ventrodorsal axial lines (VDALs) or rostrocaudal axial lines (RCALs) of the trunk and hindlimb. 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate(DiI) -induced fluorescent zones appeared in laminae I-III of the <BrainRegion>dorsal horn</BrainRegion> in the transverse section. Several fluorescent zones appeared at different mediolateral portions after tracer application to ventrodorsal axial lines(VDALs) . After tracer was applied to rostrocaudal axial lines(RCALs) , a single zone of fluorescence was observed. Serial transverse sections were used to reconstruct fluorescent zones in lamina II and to illustrate the rostrocaudally elongated band-like projection fields in a horizontal plane. In the horizontal plane, the fluorescent zones of ventrodorsal axial lines(VDALs) were reconstructed to band-like projection fields. These fields were arranged mediolaterally and extended rostrocaudally for approximately the length of one <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> segment or less. The fluorescent zones of rostrocaudal axial lines(RCALs) were reconstructed to one band-like projection field. This field extended rostrocaudally over several <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> segments. Cutaneous afferents from the ventral median line of the trunk, tail, hindlimb, sole, and ventral side of the digits projected to the medial margin of the <BrainRegion>dorsal horn</BrainRegion>. Cutaneous afferents from the dorsal median lines projected to the lateral margin of the <BrainRegion>dorsal horn</BrainRegion>. By analyzing the pattern of the body surface regions and the ventrodorsal axial lines(VDALs) and rostrocaudal axial lines(RCALs) , the central projection fields of body surface regions could be hypothesized, based on the central projection fields of the individual VDAL and RCAL afferents. Thus, we established a detailed dorsal view map of the central projection fields of cutaneous primary afferents.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Origins of afferents to <BrainRegion>visual suprageniculate nucleus</BrainRegion> of the cat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Small iontophoretic ejections of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) were made from recording-multibarrel micropipette assemblies in areas of the cat&apos;s <BrainRegion>suprageniculate nucleus</BrainRegion> (SGn) that contained visually responsive neurones. The sources of afferents of the <BrainRegion>suprageniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(SGn) were determined by locating the labeled cell bodies of neurones that were presumed to send their axons to the area of the <BrainRegion>suprageniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(SGn) containing the light-sensitive cells. The greatest concentration of labeled cell bodies was found in the <BrainRegion>granular insular cortex</BrainRegion> and the adjacent area of <BrainRegion>agranular insula</BrainRegion>. Most cells projecting to <BrainRegion>suprageniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(SGn) from these areas were distributed in the middle and lower laminae. A second intensely labeled region was found in <BrainRegion>stratum opticum</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>stratum griseum intermediate of the superior colliculus</BrainRegion>. Other areas containing labeled cells that were distributed with intermediate density included the <BrainRegion>ventral thalamic nuclear complex</BrainRegion> (basal, medial, and lateral divisions), <BrainRegion>periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion> (PAG), <BrainRegion>zona incerta</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>pretectal nuclei</BrainRegion> (posterior, medial, and anterior divisions). Sparsely labeled sites included the <BrainRegion>fields of Forel</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>substantia nigra</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>pars reticulata</BrainRegion>), <BrainRegion>peri-insular cortex</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>profundum</BrainRegion>), <BrainRegion>lateral suprasylvian cortex</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>posterolateral lateral suprasylvian</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>PLLS</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>posteromedial lateral suprasylvian</BrainRegion>, PMLS), <BrainRegion>anterior ectosylvian cortex</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>thalamic reticular complex</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>nucleus of the optic tract</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>basal part of the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>pontine reticular nucleus</BrainRegion> (oralis) and <BrainRegion>adjacent reticular formation</BrainRegion>. Together with previous electrophysiological and neuroanatomical studies, the findings suggest that the <BrainRegion>suprageniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(SGn) provides an integrating link between <BrainRegion>limbic structures</BrainRegion> and certain modalities of sensory information.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Cell birthdays and rate of differentiation of ganglion and horizontal cells of the developing cat&apos;s <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Tritiated thymidine autoradiography experiments demonstrated that three cell classes are produced by ventricular cells during the first phase of neurogenesis: <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> ganglion cells, A-type horizontal cells, and cone photoreceptors. Light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy were used to study the migration and morphological differentiation of these three cell classes. The patterns of postmitotic migration are of interest because these three classes of cells are found in three different layers of the adult <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>. Cones retain their position at the outer limiting membrane (OLM) throughout life and do not migrate. Ganglion cells migrate immediately to the proximal (vitread) layer of the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> and begin to differentiate. In contrast, A-type horizontal cells migrated away from the outer limiting membrane(OLM) within 10-14 days after their final mitosis but were morphologically relatively undifferentiated at that time. Subsequent differentiation of the A-type horizontal cell is also protracted; dendrites are not observed until approximately 3 weeks after the final mitosis. These observations suggest that there are several interacting mechanisms involved in neurogenesis: a sequence that produces a specific cohort of committed cells at a specific time, the subsequent migration of postmitotic neuroblasts to an appropriate position in the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>, and a spatial gradient of differentiation increasing from distal to proximal layers. While this distribution of differentiated cells early in fetal development is striking, the existence of underlying time-dependent processes that might cause this apparent spatial phenomenon cannot be eliminated.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>How do functional maps in <BrainRegion>primary visual cortex</BrainRegion> vary with eccentricity?</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>It is important to understand whether functional maps of <BrainRegion>primary visual cortex</BrainRegion> (V1) are organized differently at the representation of different eccentricities. By using <BrainRegion>optical</BrainRegion> imaging of intrinsic signals, we compared the maps of orientation and spatial frequency (SF) preference between central (0-3 degrees ) and paracentral (4-8 degrees ) <BrainRegion>V1</BrainRegion> in the prosimian bush baby (Otolemur garnetti). No differences related to eccentricity were found for orientation selectivity or magnitude between <BrainRegion>central and paracentral V1</BrainRegion>. We found, however, that cardinal orientations were overrepresented in central but not in <BrainRegion>paracentral V1</BrainRegion> and that isoorientation domain size tended to be smaller in the central representation. We demonstrated that spatial frequency was represented continuously across <BrainRegion>V1</BrainRegion>, and that the map of spatial frequency(SF) preference exhibited eccentricity-dependent variations, with more territory devoted to higher spatial frequency(SF) s in <BrainRegion>central</BrainRegion> than in <BrainRegion>paracentral V1</BrainRegion>. Although there were no spatial relationships between orientation domains and cytochrome oxidase (CO) blobs or interblobs, cytochrome oxidase(CO) blobs tended to prefer lower spatial frequency(SF) s than interblobs. Taken together with previous research, our data indicate that functional domains in <BrainRegion>V1</BrainRegion> show eccentricity-related differences in organization and also support the idea that different maps (with or without specific geometrical relationships) are organized for adequate coverage of each feature in visual space.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Integrity of the <BrainRegion>blood-brain barrier</BrainRegion> in <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> xenografts is correlated with the immunological status of the host.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The purpose of this study was to determine the immunological correlates of <BrainRegion>blood-brain barrier</BrainRegion> breakdown in <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> xenografts in rats by utilizing skin grafting to initiate a timed immune response to the transplanted neural tissue. Embryonic day 13-14 CD-1 mouse <BrainRegion>retinae</BrainRegion> were grafted into the <BrainRegion>brainstem parenchyma</BrainRegion> of neonatal Sprague-Dawley rats. In one group of animals a 100 mm2 CD-1 skin graft was placed on the flank 21 days after the initial neural transplant in order to provoke an immune response to the neural graft. Control animals received no skin graft. Animals were injected with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) in the femoral vein 2-8 days after skin grafting. Brains were processed for Nissl, horseradish peroxidase(HRP) -tetramethylbenzidine, and anti-M-6, -lymphocyte, -macrophage, and -astrocyte antibodies. Experimental and control animals injected 2-4 days after skin grafting showed no leakage of reaction product in the grafted tissue. A small percentage (one of eight) of 5-day animals showed isolated, patchy leakage, but no evidence of rejection of the neural graft. At 6 days all of the grafts showed evidence of leakage, and 71% of these grafts showed infiltration of lymphocytes. By 7-8 days extensive leakage of horseradish peroxidase(HRP) and widespread infiltration of lymphocytes and macrophages were clearly evident. The present study demonstrates that <BrainRegion>blood-brain barrier</BrainRegion> breakdown is correlated closely with the sequence of immunological rejection of the graft. While these results confirm that a barrier exists in healthy neural transplants, they suggest that immunological factors should be considered in cases in which grafts are not protected by an intact barrier.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Distribution in <BrainRegion>area 17</BrainRegion> of neurons projecting to the <BrainRegion>pontine nuclei</BrainRegion>: a quantitative study in the cat with retrograde transport of HRP-WGA.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The number and distribution of corticopontine neurons within <BrainRegion>area 17</BrainRegion> of the cat were studied quantitatively with the use of retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase-wheat germ agglutinin. Eight cats received stereotactic injections in the <BrainRegion>pontine nuclei</BrainRegion>; in three of these complete staining of the parts of the <BrainRegion>pontine nuclei</BrainRegion> receiving fibers from the <BrainRegion>visual cortex</BrainRegion> was achieved. Labeled cells were counted in frontal sections through the hemisphere, spaced at 0.5 mm. The borders of <BrainRegion>area 17</BrainRegion> were determined cyto- and myeloarchitectonically and a flat map was produced for each animal. A map of the representation of the visual field in 10 degrees X 10 degrees blocks in the first visual area (Tusa et al., &apos;78, '81) was transferred to our maps of <BrainRegion>area 17</BrainRegion>. The density and number of labeled corticopontine cells could then be determined within blocks of the <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion> representing 10 degrees X 10 degrees of the visual field. The cell density (number of labeled cells per mm2 <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion>) was found in general to be highest in parts of the <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion> representing peripheral parts of the visual field. The cell density is low in <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion> representing the central visual field, but the lowest density was found in the representation of a para-central region in the upper visual field. Furthermore, <BrainRegion>cortical regions</BrainRegion> representing the lower part of the visual field have a higher cell density than those representing the upper part; in four cases, 68-86% of all labeled cells were found in parts of <BrainRegion>area 17</BrainRegion> representing the visual field below the horizontal meridian. Since there is an enlarged <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> representation of central vision, the much lower cell densities in &quot;central" parts of <BrainRegion>area 17</BrainRegion> than in &quot;peripheral" parts may mean that all parts of the visual field are represented with equal numbers of corticopontine neurons ("linear" representation). This is not the case, however, since the number of labeled cells per 10 degrees X 10 degrees is considerably higher in the <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion> representing the central 10 degrees and medial parts of the lower visual field than in the rest of <BrainRegion>area 17</BrainRegion>. Assuming that the corticopontine cells in the <BrainRegion>visual cortex</BrainRegion> transmit spatially relevant information, we conclude that there is an overrepresentation of central vision and the medial parts of the lower visual field in the corticopontine projection from <BrainRegion>area 17</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Nuclear organization of the bullfrog <BrainRegion>diencephalon</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>A cytoarchitectonic analysis was performed on the <BrainRegion>diencephalic nuclei</BrainRegion> of the bullfrog, Rana catesbeiana. The <BrainRegion>epithalamus</BrainRegion> contains two widely recognized <BrainRegion>habenular nuclei</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion> has three subdivisions: <BrainRegion>dorsal and ventral thalamus</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>posterior tuberculum</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>dorsal thalamus</BrainRegion> may be further parcelled into anterior, middle, and posterior zones. Connectional data from other studies support this zonation. The <BrainRegion>anterior zone</BrainRegion> projects to the <BrainRegion>telencephalic pallium</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>middle zone nuclei</BrainRegion> receive a strong input from the <BrainRegion>midbrain</BrainRegion> roof and project to the <BrainRegion>telencephalic striatal complex</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>posterior zone nuclei</BrainRegion> do not appear to project to the <BrainRegion>telencephalon</BrainRegion>; they may eventually be placed in the <BrainRegion>pretectum</BrainRegion>, a transitional area between the <BrainRegion>diencephalon</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>mesencephalon</BrainRegion>. Two of the <BrainRegion>ventral thalamic</BrainRegion> populations have been frequently placed in the <BrainRegion>dorsal thalamus</BrainRegion> and called the <BrainRegion>nucleus rotundus</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>. These terms imply homology with <BrainRegion>sauropsid dorsal thalamic nuclei</BrainRegion>, but our analysis and current connectional information do not support such homologies. We have given these populations more neutral names. The <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion> is divisible into a <BrainRegion>preoptic and infundibular hypothalamus</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>preoptic area</BrainRegion> can be further separated into <BrainRegion>anterior and posterior preoptic areas</BrainRegion>. The posterior area contains the <BrainRegion>magnocellular preoptic nucleus</BrainRegion> and a dorsal arm of this nucleus, often placed in the <BrainRegion>ventral thalamus</BrainRegion>, was recognized. We have tentatively placed the <BrainRegion>posterior entopeduncular nucleus</BrainRegion> in the <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>A quantitative analysis of parvalbumin neurons in rabbit <BrainRegion>auditory neocortex</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Parvalbumin (PV) is a calcium-binding protein present in GABAergic cells in the <BrainRegion>cerebral cortex</BrainRegion> and in thalamic relay neurons. In the present study, parvalbumin immunocytochemistry ( Parvalbumin(PV) i) and stereological methods were used to obtain estimates of <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> volume, total neuron number, laminar density, and the percentage of Parvalbumin(PV) -immunoreactive neurons in <BrainRegion>auditory neocortex</BrainRegion>. Parvalbumin(PV) i clearly delineated the <BrainRegion>primary auditory cortex</BrainRegion> (AI), which was characterized by two Parvalbumin(PV) + bands: dense terminal-like labeling within lamina III/IV and Parvalbumin(PV) + somata in lamina VIa. Stereological analysis of Nissl-stained sections revealed that the total number of neurons in rabbit <BrainRegion>auditory cortex</BrainRegion>(AI) was 1.48 x 10(6) with a mean neuronal density of 55 x 10(3)/mm3. Based on a mean <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> thickness of 1.92 mm, there are approximately 106,000 neurons in a 1 mm2 column of <BrainRegion>auditory cortex</BrainRegion>. Parvalbumin(PV) i yields an extraordinary Golgi-like staining of nonpyramidal cells in all <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> layers. Parvalbumin(PV) + nonpyramidal cells constitute approximately 7.0% of the neurons in <BrainRegion>auditory cortex</BrainRegion>(AI) . There were significant differences in the morphology and density of Parvalbumin(PV) + neurons across layers. Although only 5% of cells in lamina I were Parvalbumin(PV) +, three nonpyramidal cell types were present. Lamina II had the highest numerical density within <BrainRegion>auditory cortex</BrainRegion>(AI) but the lowest percentage of Parvalbumin(PV) + neurons (3.3%). Lamina II, however, contained the greatest diversity of Parvalbumin(PV) + nonpyramidal cell types, which included small multipolar cells, bipolar cells, and, less frequently, large cells of the bitufted, bipolar, and stellate varieties. Lamina IV had one of the highest numerical densities (67.6 x 10(3) neurons/mm3) and contributed nearly 27% of the total neuron number in <BrainRegion>auditory cortex</BrainRegion>(AI) . The numerical density of Parvalbumin(PV) + nonpyramidal cells was also greatest within lamina IV (7.1 x 10(3)/mm3) where they formed 10.4% of the neuronal population. Parvalbumin(PV) + nonpyramidal cells in lamina IV and lamina III were predominantly large basket-type cells with bitufted dendritic domains and tangentially oriented local axonal plexuses. The terminal-like label within lamina III/IV derived in part from the basket-cell axons, which formed pericellular arrays around unstained somata. Cell-sparse lamina V contained the largest Parvalbumin(PV) + nonpyramidal cells in <BrainRegion>auditory cortex</BrainRegion>(AI) . These cells, which formed 11% of the neuron population in lamina V, were notable for their tangentially oriented dendritic fields and local axonal arbors. Parvalbumin(PV) i partitioned lamina VI into VIa and VIb. Large multipolar nonpyramidal cells were distributed throughout lamina VI and made up approximately 6% of the total population. Lamina VIa contained a band of lightly labeled Parvalbumin(PV) + pyramidal neurons that formed 15% of the neuronal population.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Evidence that transmitter-containing dystrophic neurites precede paired helical filament and Alz-50 formation within senile plaques in the <BrainRegion>amygdala</BrainRegion> of nondemented elderly and patients with Alzheimer&apos;s disease.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Immunocytochemical techniques were employed to examine the temporal ordering whereby amyloid beta-protein (A beta P) and neuronal elements collectively come together to form senile plaques in Alzheimer&apos;s disease (AD). Specifically, we addressed three questions: (1) whether A beta P deposition precedes or follows neuritic changes; (2) whether paired helical filament (PHF) formation is an early or late event in the genesis of the dystrophic neurites which participate in plaque formation; and (3) whether the density of senile plaques displays any relationship with the prevalence of paired helical filament(PHF) or Alz-50 containing neurons. To address these questions we studied the <BrainRegion>amygdala</BrainRegion> from a group of patients with Alzheimer&apos;s disease(AD) , a group of nondemented age-matched individuals exhibiting a sufficient number of senile plaques to be classified by neuropathological criteria as Alzheimer's disease(AD) , and a group of age-matched controls without Alzheimer's disease(AD) pathology. Amyloid-bearing plaques were demonstrated by A beta P immunolabeling and thioflavine-S staining. Neuritic changes in the form of dystrophic neurites were observed with the aid of antibodies against paired helical filament(PHF) , Alz-50, as well as antibodies against several neuropeptides (i.e., substance P, somatostatin, and neurotensin) and the acetylcholine biosynthetic enzyme, choline acetyltransferase. By using a graded range of pathologic changes both within and across the patient population to provide us with a means of evaluating plaque deposition from its earliest to most advanced stages of development, we observed in patients and/or regions of the <BrainRegion>amygdala</BrainRegion> displaying a mild degree of pathologic change A beta P deposition in the absence of any neuritic changes. With increasing density of A beta P, however, we began to observe dystrophic neurites within plaques. In regions of relatively few plaques, the dystrophic neurites were immunolabeled only with antibodies against the various neurotransmitters and they lacked evidence of cytoskeletal pathology (i.e., Alz-50 or paired helical filament(PHF) ). Only as the density of A beta P increased further within a region, were dystrophic neurites observed that exhibited Alz-50 or paired helical filament(PHF) . In no instance did we observe a relationship between the density of A beta P deposition and the density of Alz-50 or paired helical filament(PHF) -immunoreactive neurons. Collectively, our data suggest that the deposition of A beta P is an early pathologic event in senile plaque formation. Thereafter, swollen neurites can be seen in the vicinity of A beta P. This early neuritic response, which can first be visualized by immunolabeling for one or another transmitter substance, is followed by alterations in the cytoskeleton as recognized initially by antibodies to Alz-50 and subsequently by the presence of paired helical filament(PHF) .</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Taste bud expression of human blood group antigens.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Some human blood group antigens are expressed by rodent epithelial cells at different stages of differentiation. Since adult taste cells are continually replaced throughout life, we investigated the expression of the H, B, A and Lewisb blood group determinants by cells of the rat fungiform, foliate and vallate papillae. We employed antibodies against the trisaccharide structures of the H, B, and A blood group antigens and against the Lewisb blood group epitope in studies of normal and denervated taste buds. The antibody against the H antigen reacted with the majority of cells in all taste buds and with cells in the spinous layer of the tongue epithelium. The B antigen was expressed by the majority of taste cells but not by other epithelial cells. The expression of the A antigen was significantly less in the fungiform taste buds than in the vallate or foliate taste buds. The A antigen was also abundantly expressed in the acini of the lingual salivary glands. The Lewisb epitope was expressed by a subset of cells in taste buds of the fungiform, foliate and vallate papillae. Taste buds are trophically dependent upon <BrainRegion>gustatory nerve</BrainRegion> innervation. Transection of the <BrainRegion>chorda tympani</BrainRegion> or the <BrainRegion>IXth nerve</BrainRegion> resulted in the loss of expression of these molecules from the gustatory epithelium, indicating that they are expressed only on differentiated taste cells. The blood group antigens are lactoseries carbohydrates; they are differentially expressed in developing <BrainRegion>cochlear</BrainRegion> hair cells and <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> neurons and may play roles in cell-cell recognition, adhesion, and other interactions important in the developing nervous system. They could have similar functions in the taste and olfactory systems, where the receptors are continually renewed and new synapses between the receptors and their neural targets continually form.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Dendritic morphology of projection neurons in the cat <BrainRegion>pretectum</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The distribution and dendritic morphology of neurons in the cat <BrainRegion>pretectal nuclear complex</BrainRegion> were analyzed with respect to their projection to the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion> (LGNd) and the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral inferior olive</BrainRegion> (IO). Single and double retrograde tracing techniques were combined with intracellular injections of either horseradish peroxidase into electrophysiologically identified <BrainRegion>pretectal neurons</BrainRegion> or Lucifer Yellow into retrogradely labeled somata. <BrainRegion>Pretectal</BrainRegion> cells afferent to the <BrainRegion>LGNd</BrainRegion> were located in the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the optic tract</BrainRegion> (NOT), adjacent <BrainRegion>dorsal terminal nucleus of the accessory optic system</BrainRegion> (DTN), and <BrainRegion>posterior pretectal nucleus</BrainRegion> (NPP). Cells projecting to the <BrainRegion>inferior olive</BrainRegion>(IO) were also distributed throughout the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the optic tract</BrainRegion>(NOT) -<BrainRegion>DTN</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>dorsal part of the NPP</BrainRegion>. Separate tracer injections (fluorogold and horseradish peroxidase [HRP] or granular blue) into the <BrainRegion>LGNd</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>inferior olive</BrainRegion>(IO) showed considerable overlap of labeled neurons in the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the optic tract</BrainRegion>(NOT) and <BrainRegion>dorsal NPP</BrainRegion>. Double-labeled neurons, however, were not observed after double tracer injections into <BrainRegion>LGNd</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>inferior olive</BrainRegion>(IO) . Partial topographical segregation of the two populations was observed along the dorsoventral axis because <BrainRegion>LGNd</BrainRegion>-projecting neurons exhibited maximum density ventral to that of <BrainRegion>inferior olive</BrainRegion>(IO) neurons. <BrainRegion>Pretectal</BrainRegion> cells to the <BrainRegion>LGNd</BrainRegion> had cell body diameters between 16 and 48 microns. Somatic shapes varied between fusiform and multipolar with considerable overlap between these two morphological appearances. Neurons projecting to the <BrainRegion>inferior olive</BrainRegion>(IO) exhibited similar cell body sizes and their morphology also varied from fusiform to multipolar. Quantitative analysis of dendritic field size and orientation, number and order of dendritic arborizations, and symmetry of the dendritic tree revealed no statistically significant difference between the two neuronal populations. Hence, neurons of the two populations cannot be unequivocally identified just from the dendritic morphology. By contrast, dendritic morphology was correlated with the topographical location of either cell type within the <BrainRegion>pretectal nuclei</BrainRegion> rather than projection. Thus, the morphological appearance of neurons located dorsally predominantly was fusiform while neurons located ventrally mostly were multipolar.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Laminar origin of <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> neurons which project upon the <BrainRegion>caudate nucleus</BrainRegion>: a horseradish peroxidase investigation in the cat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The horseradish peroxidase method was used to study the <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> projections upon the <BrainRegion>caudate nucleus</BrainRegion> in the cat. The cells of origin of the corticostriatal projection arise from both the <BrainRegion>supragranular (II and III) and infragranular (V and VI) cortical layers</BrainRegion>, in contrast to all other known corticofugal pathways to <BrainRegion>subcortical structures</BrainRegion>, which appear to arise only from the infragranular layers. This finding has been verified in the present study by several novel surgical procedures, which include direct injections into the <BrainRegion>caudate nucleus</BrainRegion>, after the overlying tissues have been removed. The present study also shows that there is a truly widespread distribution of the cells contributing to the corticostriatal projection. Some portion of every <BrainRegion>neocortical gyrus</BrainRegion> contains labeled cells, though their relative numbers vary greatly. Also, simple topographical relationships are maintained, but there is much overlap. In addition, present findings show that the corticostriatal projection is strikingly bilateral and originates from regions which are homotopic to the ipsilateral projection.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Projections to the <BrainRegion>basilar pontine nuclei</BrainRegion> from <BrainRegion>face sensory and motor regions of the cerebral cortex</BrainRegion> in the rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Orthograde axonal transport tracing methods were used to describe the projections to the <BrainRegion>basilar pontine nuclei</BrainRegion> (BPN) which arise within the face representation of <BrainRegion>motor or somatosensory cerebral cortex</BrainRegion>. Injections centered in <BrainRegion>motor face (MF) cortex</BrainRegion> resulted in the labeling of several <BrainRegion>corticopontine terminal fields</BrainRegion> which exhibit a rostrocaudal columnar arrangement within the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral basilar pontine nuclei</BrainRegion>(BPN) . The location of such terminal zones is consistent with the somatotopic pattern of termination previously described for <BrainRegion>limb sensorimotor cortices</BrainRegion>. In contrast, the projections from <BrainRegion>somatosensory face (SF) cortical regions</BrainRegion> largely terminate in <BrainRegion>basilar pontine nuclei</BrainRegion>(BPN) areas separate from those receiving either limb sensorimotor or motor face(MF) inputs. Both <BrainRegion>motor face(MF) and somatosensory face(SF) cortices</BrainRegion> also give rise to projections to the <BrainRegion>contralateral basilar pontine nuclei</BrainRegion>(BPN) ; those from <BrainRegion>somatosensory face(SF) cortex</BrainRegion> are less extensive than those of motor face(MF) origin. In addition to their relationship with <BrainRegion>limb sensorimotor corticopontine</BrainRegion> terminations, the motor face(MF) projections to the <BrainRegion>basilar pontine nuclei</BrainRegion>(BPN) also seem to partially overlap the projection zones of the cerebellopontine system, particularly the regions projected upon by the <BrainRegion>lateral cerebellar nucleus</BrainRegion>. The somatosensory face(SF) projections, on the other hand, appear to terminate in <BrainRegion>basilar pontine nuclei</BrainRegion>(BPN) areas that also receive input from either the <BrainRegion>dorsal column nuclei</BrainRegion> or the <BrainRegion>spinal trigeminal complex</BrainRegion>. There is only minimal potential overlap between motor face(MF) and somatosensory face(SF) projections in the <BrainRegion>basilar pontine nuclei</BrainRegion>(BPN) . With regard to the pontocerebellar system, the projections from <BrainRegion>motor face(MF) cortex</BrainRegion> terminate among <BrainRegion>basilar pontine nuclei</BrainRegion>(BPN) neurons which project to the <BrainRegion>cerebellar hemispheres</BrainRegion>, particularly <BrainRegion>lobus simplex</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>crus I</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>crus II</BrainRegion>. The somatosensory face(SF) projections also overlap <BrainRegion>basilar pontine nuclei</BrainRegion>(BPN) neurons which project to the <BrainRegion>lateral hemispheres</BrainRegion> in addition to the <BrainRegion>paraflocculus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>vermal lobules VII and IXa,b</BrainRegion>. Taken together these observations suggest that subsets of <BrainRegion>basilar pontine nuclei</BrainRegion>(BPN) neurons might exist such that some receive convergent inputs from systems whose function can generally be regarded as motor (<BrainRegion>sensorimotor cortex</BrainRegion>, cerebellopontine) while another population of <BrainRegion>basilar pontine nuclei</BrainRegion>(BPN) neurons might integrate signals from systems which transmit somatosensory information (<BrainRegion>dorsal column nuclei</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>spinal trigeminal</BrainRegion>).</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Immunohistochemical localization of DARPP-32 in the brain of the lizard, Gekko gecko: co-occurrence with tyrosine hydroxylase.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>To assess the relationship between dopaminergic neuronal structures and dopaminoceptive structures in a reptile, single and double immunohistochemical procedures with antibodies directed against DARPP-32 (dopamine- and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein with an apparent molecular mass of 32,000 daltons),a phosphoprotein related to the dopamine D(1)-receptor, and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) were applied to the brain of the lizard, Gekko gecko. The DARPP-32 antibody yielded a well-differentiated pattern of staining in the brain of Gekko. In general, areas that are densely innervated by tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) -immunoreactive, putative dopaminergic fibers, such as the <BrainRegion>nucleus accumbens</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>striatum</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>dorsal ventricular ridge</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>amygdaloid</BrainRegion> complex, display strong immunoreactivity for DARPP-32 in somata and neuropil. Distinct cellular DARPP-32 immunoreactivity was also found in the <BrainRegion>lateral cortex</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>ventral hypothalamus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>habenula</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>central nucleus of the torus semicircularis</BrainRegion>, midbrain <BrainRegion>tectum</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>parvicellular isthmic nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>raphe nuclei</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>caudal rhombencephalic tegmentum</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>. Striatal projections to the <BrainRegion>midbrain</BrainRegion> and their target, i.e., the <BrainRegion>substantia nigra pars reticulata</BrainRegion>, were found to be strongly immunoreactive. Double immunofluorescence staining revealed that dopaminergic cells generally do not stain for DARPP-32, except for cells in the <BrainRegion>ventral hypothalamus</BrainRegion> and at <BrainRegion>caudal rhombencephalic</BrainRegion> levels. In conclusion, the distribution of DARPP-32 in the brain of the lizard Gekko gecko largely resembles the pattern observed in birds and mammals, at least as far as <BrainRegion>basal ganglia</BrainRegion> structures are concerned. On the other hand, there are several specific features of DARPP-32 distribution in the gekkonid brain that deserve further attention, such as cellular colocalization of DARPP-32 and tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) immunoreactivity in <BrainRegion>hypothalamic</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>caudal rhombencephalic areas</BrainRegion>, and cellular DARPP-32 immunoreactivity in the <BrainRegion>tectum</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>central nucleus</BrainRegion> of the <BrainRegion>torus semicircularis</BrainRegion> of the <BrainRegion>midbrain</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>superior and inferior raphe nuclei</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>The postnatal development of neurons in the <BrainRegion>dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion> of the rat: a Golgi study.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The postnatal differentiation of neurons in the <BrainRegion>dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion> of the albino rat was studied using the Golgi-Cox technique. At least four animals were used at postnatal ages 12 hours, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20, 24, 28, 35 days and adult. Presumptive thalamo-cortical projection cells (Class A cells of Grossman et al., &apos;73) and non-projection, intrinsic neurons (Class B cells) are distinguishable at 12 hours after birth. At this stage both types of neuron are immature, with prominent growth cones at their dendritic extremities. Dendritic growth and differentiation appear to be complete by 18 days. Relay cells display two apparent "growth spurts" characterized by noticeable enlargement of the perikaryon and a marked increase in dendritic length and complexity. One occurs between days 4 and 6 and coincides with a period of enhanced synaptogenesis and gliogenesis: the second occurs between days 14 and 15, around the time of eye opening (day 14) and may be related to a further phase of increased synaptogenesis and gliogenesis (Karlsson, '67; Biesold et al., '76). Class B cells appear to "lag" behind class A cells in their initial postnatal differentiation, but also reach their mature condition by day 18.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Light and electron microscopic distribution of the AMPA receptor subunit, GluR2, in the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> of control and G86R mutant superoxide dismutase transgenic mice.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Excitotoxicity has been hypothesized to contribute to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) neurodegeneration. The similar pattern of vulnerability in the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> of mutant superoxide dismutase (SOD-1) transgenic mice and mice treated with excitotoxins supports a role for excitotoxicity in the mechanism of degeneration. The distribution of the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) class of glutamate receptors (GluRs) with different calcium permeabilities has been proposed as an explanation for this differential vulnerability. GluR2 appears to be the dominant determinant of calcium permeability for AMPA receptors; thus, it is critical for their contribution to excitotoxic mechanisms. In this study, we investigate the distribution of GluR2 immunoreactivity in the spinal cord of control and SOD-1 transgenic mice. GluR2 immunoreactivity is present equally within vulnerable neurons (i.e., motor neurons and calretinin-immunoreactive neurons) as well as nonvulnerable neurons (i.e., calbindin-immunoreactive neurons and dorsal horn neurons). In addition, postembedding immunoelectron microscopy reveals that GluR2 is present in synapses of <BrainRegion>dorsal and ventral horn</BrainRegion> neurons and that the percentage of labeled synapses and numbers of immunogold particles per synapse do not vary between these <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> regions. Comparing control mice with SOD-1 transgenic mice, at both the light and the electron microscopic levels, the distribution and intensity of GluR2-immunoreactivity do not appear to be altered. These results suggest that the cellular and synaptic distribution of GluR2 is not a determinant of the selective vulnerability observed in SOD-1 transgenic mice or in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis(ALS) patients.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Comparative localization of neurons containing ovine corticotropin releasing factor (CRF)-like and neurophysin-like immunoreactivity in the <BrainRegion>diencephalon</BrainRegion> of the pigeon (Columba livia domestica).</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Neural elements immunoreactive for ovine corticotropin releasing factor-like immunoreactivity (oCRF-LI) were shown to be present in the <BrainRegion>diencephalon</BrainRegion> of the pigeon by using peroxidase-antiperoxidase immunocytochemistry. The external zone of the anterior median eminence contains a rich network of varicose ovine corticotropin releasing factor-like immunoreactivity(oCRF-LI) fibers in close proximity to the <BrainRegion>pituitary</BrainRegion> portal capillaries. Perikarya reactive for ovine corticotropin releasing factor-like immunoreactivity(oCRF-LI) were found in several regions known to innervate the median eminence and gave rise to axons which joined the hypothalamo-hypophyseal tract. A close topographical relationship between neurophysin-containing and ovine corticotropin releasing factor-like immunoreactivity(oCRF-LI) -containing neurons was found in <BrainRegion>anterior periventricular regions</BrainRegion>. These observations suggest that ovine corticotropin releasing factor-like immunoreactivity(oCRF-LI) material might be involved in the <BrainRegion>hypothalmic</BrainRegion> control of <BrainRegion>anterior pituitary</BrainRegion> hormone secretion in birds, and that neurophysin- and ovine corticotropin releasing factor-like immunoreactivity(oCRF-LI) -producing nerve cells might be functionally coupled.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Axotomy-induced neuronal death and reactive astrogliosis in the <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion> following a lesion of the <BrainRegion>visual cortex</BrainRegion> in the rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Following a unilateral lesion of the <BrainRegion>visual cortex</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>cortical areas 17, 18, and 18a</BrainRegion>) in adult rats, neurons in the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion> (LGN) are axotomized, which leads to their atrophy and death. The time course of this neuronal degeneration was studied quantitatively, and the astroglial response was examined with glial fibrillary acidic protein immunohistochemistry. More than 95% of the neurons in the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(LGN) survive during the first 3 days following a lesion of the <BrainRegion>visual cortex</BrainRegion>. However, in the next 4 days, massive neuronal death ensues, reducing the number of surviving neurons to approximately 33% of normal by the end of the first postoperative week. Between 2 weeks and 24 weeks postoperatively, the number of neurons present in the <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus(</BrainRegion>LGN) declines very gradually from 34% to 17% of normal. Three days after a lesion of the <BrainRegion>visual cortex</BrainRegion>, the mean cross-sectional areas of <BrainRegion>ipsilateral lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(LGN) neurons are 13% smaller than normal (87%). By 1 week after the operation, surviving <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(LGN) neurons have atrophied to 66% of their normal area. Subsequently, the size of surviving neurons declines slowly to approximately 50% of normal at 24 weeks after the <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> lesion. Astrocytes in the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(LGN) also react to <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> damage. At 1 day after a lesion of the <BrainRegion>visual cortex</BrainRegion>, glial fibrillary acidic protein immunoreactivity in the <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(LGN) is almost undetectable, but a distinct increase in immunoreactivity is seen at 3 days. Immunoreactivity peaks between 1 week and 2 weeks postoperatively and, thereafter, remains intense for at least 24 weeks. Thus, following a lesion of the <BrainRegion>visual cortex</BrainRegion>, the somata of neurons in the <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(LGN) remain essentially normal morphologically for about 3 days before the onset of rapid atrophy and death. Moreover, most of the neural cell death that occurs in the <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(LGN) after axotomy takes place in the last half of the first postoperative week.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Thalamic</BrainRegion> connections of the <BrainRegion>vestibular cortical fields</BrainRegion> in the squirrel monkey (Saimiri sciureus).</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The afferent <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> connections to <BrainRegion>cortical fields</BrainRegion> important for control of head movement in space were analysed by intracortical retrograde tracer injections. The <BrainRegion>proprioceptive/vestibular area 3aV</BrainRegion>, the neck-trunk region of <BrainRegion>area 3a</BrainRegion>, receives two thirds of its <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> projections from the <BrainRegion>oral and superior ventroposterior nucleus</BrainRegion> (VPO/VPS), which is considered as the proprioceptive relay of the <BrainRegion>ventroposterior complex</BrainRegion> (Kaas et al., J. Comp. Neurol. 226:211-240, 1984). The <BrainRegion>parieto-insular vestibular cortex</BrainRegion> (PIVC, <BrainRegion>area retroinsularis</BrainRegion>, Ri) receives its main <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> input from <BrainRegion>posterior parts of the ventroposterior complex</BrainRegion> and from the <BrainRegion>medial pulvinar</BrainRegion>. Anatomical evidence is presented that the <BrainRegion>posterior region of the ventroposterior complex</BrainRegion> is a special compartment within this <BrainRegion>principal somatosensory relay complex</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>parietotemporal association area T3</BrainRegion>, mainly involved in visual-optokinetic signal processing, receives a substantial input from the <BrainRegion>medial, the lateral, and the inferior pulvinar</BrainRegion>. Dual tracer experiments revealed that about 5% of the <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> neurons projecting to <BrainRegion>3aV</BrainRegion> were spatially intermingled with neurons projecting to <BrainRegion>areas parieto-insular vestibular cortex</BrainRegion>(PIVC) or <BrainRegion>T3</BrainRegion>. This spatial intermingling was distributed over small but numerous, <BrainRegion>circumscribed thalamic regions</BrainRegion>, called &quot;common patches," which were found mainly in the <BrainRegion>intralaminar nuclei</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>posterior group of thalamic nuclei</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>caudal parts of the ventroposterior complex</BrainRegion>. The &quot;common patches" may indicate a functional coupling of <BrainRegion>area 3aV</BrainRegion> with the <BrainRegion>parieto-insular vestibular cortex</BrainRegion>(PIVC) or <BrainRegion>area T3</BrainRegion> on the <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> level. In control experiments <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> projections to the <BrainRegion>granular insula Ig</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>anterior part of area 7</BrainRegion>, two <BrainRegion>cerebral structures</BrainRegion> connected with the <BrainRegion>vestibular cortical areas</BrainRegion>, were studied. Some overlap in the <BrainRegion>thalamic relay structures</BrainRegion> projecting to these areas with those projecting to the <BrainRegion>vestibular cortices</BrainRegion> was found. A quantitative evaluation of <BrainRegion>thalamic regions</BrainRegion> projecting to different <BrainRegion>cortical structures</BrainRegion> was performed by constructing so-called &quot;thalamograms." A scheme was developed that describes the afferent <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> connections by which vestibular, visual-optokinetic, and proprioceptive signals reach the <BrainRegion>vestibular cortical areas</BrainRegion> <BrainRegion>parieto-insular vestibular cortex</BrainRegion>(PIVC) and <BrainRegion>3aV</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Efferent connections of the <BrainRegion>caudate nucleus</BrainRegion>, including <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> projections of the <BrainRegion>striatum</BrainRegion> and other <BrainRegion>basal ganglia</BrainRegion>: an autoradiographic and horseradish peroxidase investigation in the cat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Tritiated tracer was injected into the head of the <BrainRegion>caudate nucleus</BrainRegion> in cats. Following such injections, labeling is present within extensive regions of both the <BrainRegion>globus pallidus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>entopeduncular nucleus</BrainRegion>, where it presents a mottled or meshlike appearance. These projections are topographically organized in that there is simple correspondence between the mediolateral, dorsoventral, and rostrocaudal origin of the <BrainRegion>caudate</BrainRegion> projection and its input to the <BrainRegion>globus pallidus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>entopeduncular nucleus</BrainRegion>. Transported tracer is also present within the <BrainRegion>substantia nigra</BrainRegion>, where it is most abundant within the <BrainRegion>pars reticularis</BrainRegion>. However, distinct labeling also overlies cells of the <BrainRegion>pars compacta</BrainRegion>, and lesser amounts of labeling are present within the <BrainRegion>pars lateralis</BrainRegion> and within the <BrainRegion>retrorubral area</BrainRegion>. Following injections of horseradish peroxidase into the <BrainRegion>caudate nucleus</BrainRegion>, and subsequent tissue processing by the tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) method of Mesulam (&apos;78), labeled anterograde fibers are present in abundance within the <BrainRegion>globus pallidus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>entopeduncular nucleus</BrainRegion>, and all subdivisions of the <BrainRegion>substantia nigra</BrainRegion>, thus confirming the autoradiographic findings. Also, it is especially obvious in this HRP material that, contrary to previous degeneration studies, both the <BrainRegion>rostromedial and caudolateral parts of the pars lateralis of the substantia nigra</BrainRegion> contain numerous anterogradely labeled fibers. Retrogradely labeled neurons are also present within the <BrainRegion>substantia nigra</BrainRegion> of these same tissue sections, where they are most abundant within the <BrainRegion>pars compacta</BrainRegion>, but lesser numbers of labeled neurons are also present within the <BrainRegion>pars reticularis</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>pars lateralis</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>retrorubral area</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>ventral tegmental area</BrainRegion> on the ipsilateral side, and all of these same subdivisions of the <BrainRegion>substantia nigra on the contralateral side</BrainRegion>. Also, within the <BrainRegion>subthalamic nucleus</BrainRegion> in these experiments, there are anterogradely labeled fibers, as well as retrogradely labeled neurons, which are interpreted to represent a reciprocal connection between the <BrainRegion>subthalamic nucleus</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>striatum</BrainRegion>. In a separate series of experiments, horseradish peroxidase was injected into the <BrainRegion>motor cortex</BrainRegion>-specifically into the <BrainRegion>anterior sigmoidal gyrus</BrainRegion>. Following such injections, labeled neurons representing afferents to the <BrainRegion>motor cortex</BrainRegion> are found in all <BrainRegion>subcortical nuclei</BrainRegion> commonly known as the &quot;<BrainRegion>basal ganglia</BrainRegion>,&quot; including the <BrainRegion>caudate nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>putamen</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>globus pallidus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>entopeduncular nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>substantia innominata</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>nucleus of the diagonal band of Broca</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>medial septal nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>claustrum</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>basolateral amygdaloid nucleus</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Prenatal development of retinocollicular projections in the rabbit: an HRP study.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The prenatal development of the rabbit&apos;s <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> projections to the <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion> (SC) was studied by using anterograde transport of horseradish peroxidase injected intraocularly. Fetuses aged embryonic day 21 (E21) to E29 and an adult rabbit were examined. Gestation in the rabbit is 30-31 days. On embryonic day 21(E21) contralaterally projecting <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> fibers invade across the entire <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion>(SC) . Their distribution is initially diffuse within the superficial laminae, but by E29 they have a distinct stratified appearance. Ipsilaterally projecting <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> fibers invade the <BrainRegion>rostral half of the superior colliculus</BrainRegion>(SC) on embryonic day 21(E21) . By E23 they cover the entire <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion>(SC) and overlap the contralateral fibers both tangentially and radially. The ipsilateral fibers for the most part are sparsely distributed, but they form a dense focal distribution in the <BrainRegion>rostrolateral quarter of the superior colliculus</BrainRegion>(SC) . This focus straddles the <BrainRegion>stratum griseum superficiale/stratum opticum (SGS/SO) border</BrainRegion>. On E25 the ipsilateral fibers maintain their widespread distribution and focal rostrolateral concentration. By E27 they are excluded almost entirely from the <BrainRegion>caudal half of the superior colliculus</BrainRegion>(SC) and are reduced in density in the rostromedial quarter of the nucleus. On E29 the ipsilateral terminal field forms distinct patches and bands that are restricted to the <BrainRegion>rostrolateral quarter of the superior colliculus</BrainRegion>(SC) and are confined to the <BrainRegion>stratum griseum superficiale/stratum opticum(SGS/SO) border</BrainRegion>. Thus, a few days before birth the pattern and location of the ipsilateral retinocollicular projection resemble those seen in the adult. The early widespread distribution of the ipsilaterally projecting <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> fibers to the <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion>(SC) and their eventual restriction in the fetal rabbit are consistent with the development of this projection in other mammalian orders.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Motor neurons of grasshopper metathoracic ganglion occur in stereotypic anatomical groups.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Anatomical groups containing identified motor neurons of the main muscles of the legs and the wings are described in a segmental ganglion of the adult grasshopper. The groups occur reproducibly in ganglia of different individuals and are a simplifying and organizing feature of ganglionic morphology. The motor neurons within each group have cell bodies near each other in the <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion> of the ganglion and primary neurites that enter the ganglionic core as a discrete bundle. The primary neurite bundles are distinctive in shape and position and have the same composition in every individual, despite variations in the positions of the cell bodies of the contributing motor neurons. The primary neurite bundle of a group is separate from those of other groups and separate from bundles of motor axons that exit or sensory axons that enter the ganglion. Each group of cell bodies in the <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion> appears from light microscope examination to be held separately within a glial surround. Areas of glial cell cytoplasm may extend considerably beyond the boundaries of the neuronal cell bodies, to give shape and structural integrity to the <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion>. Similarities between the morphology of the adult groups reported here and the descriptions by others of embryonic and larval nervous systems suggest to us that the motor neurons of each group are the progeny of a single neuroblast.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Dendritic and axonal targeting of the vesicular acetylcholine transporter to membranous cytoplasmic organelles in <BrainRegion>laterodorsal and pedunculopontine tegmental nuclei</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Autoregulation of cholinergic neurons in the <BrainRegion>laterodorsal tegmental (LDT) and pedunculopontine (PPT) nuclei</BrainRegion> has been implicated in many functions, most importantly in drug reinforcement and in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. This autoregulation is attributed to the release of acetylcholine, but neither the storage or release sites are known. To determine these sites, we used electron microscopy for the immunocytochemical localization of antipeptide antiserum raised against the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAchT) that is responsible for the uptake of acetylcholine into storage vesicles. The cellular and subcellular distribution of vesicular acetylcholine transporter(VAchT) was remarkably similar in the two regions by by using each of two methods, immunogold and immunoperoxidase. In both <BrainRegion>pedunculopontine(PPT) and laterodorsal tegmental(LDT) nuclei</BrainRegion>, vesicular acetylcholine transporter(VAchT) labeling was seen mainly on membranous organelles including the trans-Golgi network in many somata. vesicular acetylcholine transporter(VAchT) -immunoreactive tubulovesicles resembling saccules of smooth endoplasmic reticulum were often seen near the plasma membrane in dendrites. The vesicular acetylcholine transporter(VAchT) -containing dendrites comprised almost 50% of the labeled profiles (1027/2129) in <BrainRegion>pedunculopontine(PPT) and laterodorsal tegmental(LDT) nuclei</BrainRegion>. The remaining vesicular acetylcholine transporter(VAchT) -immunoreactive profiles were primarily small unmyelinated axons and axon terminals. In axon terminals, vesicular acetylcholine transporter(VAchT) was densely localized to membranes of small synaptic vesicles. The vesicular acetylcholine transporter(VAchT) -immunoreactive axon terminals formed either symmetric or asymmetric synapses. The postsynaptic targets of these axon terminals included dendrites that were with (36/110) or without (74/110) vesicular acetylcholine transporter(VAchT) immunoreactivity. Our results suggest that dendrites, as well as axon terminals, have the potential for storage and release of acetylcholine in the <BrainRegion>laterodorsal tegmental(LDT) and pedunculopontine(PPT) nuclei</BrainRegion>. The released acetylcholine is likely to play a major role in autoregulation of mesopontine cholinergic neurons.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Acoustic chiasm V</BrainRegion>: inhibition and excitation in the ipsilateral and contralateral projections of <BrainRegion>LSO</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>When this series of experiments was begun in 1984, the activity of each <BrainRegion>lateral superior olive</BrainRegion> (LSO) in the mammalian <BrainRegion>hindbrain</BrainRegion> was known to encode the hemifield of acoustic space containing a sound source. However, the almost random bilaterality of its ascending projections seemed to jumble that identification before reaching the <BrainRegion>midbrain</BrainRegion>. At the same time, electrophysiological studies of <BrainRegion>lateral superior olive</BrainRegion>(LSO) and its efferent target in the <BrainRegion>inferior colliculus</BrainRegion>, along with the strictly contralateral deficits in sound localization resulting from unilateral lesions above the level of the <BrainRegion>superior olives</BrainRegion>, indicated that hemifield allegiance was largely maintained (though reversed) at the <BrainRegion>midbrain</BrainRegion>. Here we present seven lines of biochemical evidence, some combined with prior ablations, supporting the notion that the anatomical segregation of the ipsilateral and contralateral fibers ascending from the <BrainRegion>lateral superior olive</BrainRegion>(LSO) is accompanied by a corresponding segregation of their neurotransmitters: most of the ascending ipsilateral projection is probably glycinergic and, hence, inhibitory in effect, while most of the contralateral projection is probably glutamatergic/aspartergic and, hence, excitatory in effect. Taken together, the inhibitory ipsilateral projections and the excitatory contralateral projections serve to amplify functional contralaterality at the higher levels of the auditory system.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Architectonic subdivision of the <BrainRegion>orbital and medial prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion> in the macaque monkey.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The <BrainRegion>orbital and medial prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion> (OMPFC) of macaque monkeys is a large but little understood region of the <BrainRegion>cerebral cortex</BrainRegion>. In this study the architectonic structure of the <BrainRegion>orbital and medial prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion>(OMPFC) was analyzed with nine histochemical and immunohistochemical stains in 32 individuals of three macaque species. The stains included Nissl, myelin, acetylcholinesterase, Timm, and selenide stains and immunohistochemical stains for parvalbumin, calbindin, a nonphosphorylated neurofilament epitope (with the SMI-32 antibody), and a membrane-bound glycoprotein (with the 8b3 antibody). In addition to patterns of cell bodies and myelinated fibers, these techniques allow the visualization of markers related to metabolism, synapses, and neurotransmitters. A <BrainRegion>cortical area</BrainRegion> was defined as distinct if it was differentiated in at least three different stains and, as described in later papers, possessed a distinct set of connections. Twenty-two areas were recognized in the <BrainRegion>orbital and medial prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion>(OMPFC) . <BrainRegion>Walker&apos;s areas 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14</BrainRegion> [J. Comp. Neurol. (1940) 73:59-86] have been subdivided into <BrainRegion>areas 10m, 10o, 11m, 11l, 12r, 12l, 12m, 12o, 13m, 13l, 13a, 13b, 14r, and 14c</BrainRegion>. On the medial wall, <BrainRegion>areas 32, 25, and 24a,b,c</BrainRegion> have been delineated, in addition to <BrainRegion>area 10m</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>agranular insula</BrainRegion> also has been recognized to extend onto the <BrainRegion>posterior orbital surface</BrainRegion> and has been subdivided into <BrainRegion>medial, intermediate, lateral, posteromedial, and posterolateral agranular insula areas</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>orbital and medial prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion>(OMPFC) , therefore, resembles other areas of primate <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion>, such as the <BrainRegion>posterior parietal and temporal cortices</BrainRegion>, where a large number of relatively small, structurally and connectionally distinct areas have been recognized. Just as the area-specific neurophysiological properties of these <BrainRegion>parietotemporal areas</BrainRegion> underlie broader regional functions such as visuospatial analysis, it is likely that the many small areas of the <BrainRegion>orbital and medial prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion>(OMPFC) also make differential contributions to the general mnemonic, sensory, and affective functions of this region.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Development of the <BrainRegion>thalamic reticular and perireticular nuclei</BrainRegion> in rats and their relationship to the course of growing corticofugal and corticopetal axons.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>This study examines the connections of the <BrainRegion>thalamic reticular and perireticular nuclei</BrainRegion> during development. In addition, because these nuclei lie directly in the path of corticofugal and corticopetal axons during development, we have examined the relationship of these growing axons to the <BrainRegion>reticular</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>perireticular</BrainRegion> cell groups. Neurones were labelled by applying DiI, wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP), or HRP to the <BrainRegion>dorsal thalamus</BrainRegion> and/or <BrainRegion>cerebral cortex</BrainRegion> of rats at different stages of development. The axons of neurons in the <BrainRegion>reticular nucleus</BrainRegion> reach the <BrainRegion>dorsal thalamus</BrainRegion> as early as embryonic day (E) 14. At this age, and during later prenatal development, a small DiI implant limited to the presumptive <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion> labels reticulothalamic and thalamocortical axons which travel in a clearly defined bundle through the <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion>. During late gestation, thalamocortical (approximately E15) and corticothalamic (approximately E17) axons pass directly through the <BrainRegion>reticular nucleus</BrainRegion> toward their targets. It is not until birth that collaterals are seen extending into the nucleus from the parent axons. Neurones in the <BrainRegion>perireticular nucleus</BrainRegion>, in contrast to those in the <BrainRegion>reticular nucleus</BrainRegion>, are not labelled from the <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion> until after birth. The <BrainRegion>perireticular nucleus</BrainRegion> is very large at a stage when the first thalamocortical axons leave and when the first corticothalamic axons approach the <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion>. These axons are seen to change course sharply in the <BrainRegion>region of the internal capsule</BrainRegion>, where there are many perireticular cells. Corticothalamic axons turn toward the <BrainRegion>reticular nucleus</BrainRegion>, and thalamocortical axons turn toward the <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> subplate. Corticospinal and corticobulbar axons, on the other hand, pass directly through the <BrainRegion>perireticular region</BrainRegion> toward their more caudal targets. After these axons have reached their targets, the <BrainRegion>perireticular nucleus</BrainRegion> reduces dramatically in size.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Retrograde tracing of the subset of afferent connections in mouse <BrainRegion>barrel cortex</BrainRegion> provided by zincergic neurons.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The <BrainRegion>barrel cortex</BrainRegion> of rodents is densely innervated by a prominent subclass of glutamatergic neurons that sequester and release zinc from their synaptic boutons. These neurons may play an important role in <BrainRegion>barrel cortex</BrainRegion> function and plasticity, as zinc has been shown to modulate synaptic function by regulating neurotransmitter release, excitatory and inhibitory amino acid receptors, and second messenger signaling cascades. Here, we utilized intracortical infusions of sodium selenite to identify the source of the zincergic innervation to the mouse <BrainRegion>barrel cortex</BrainRegion>. Our results demonstrate that the majority of zincergic projections to the <BrainRegion>barrel cortex</BrainRegion> arose from ipsilateral and callosal neurons, situated in <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> layers 2/3 and 6. Regionally, these labeled neurons were most abundant within the <BrainRegion>barrel cortex</BrainRegion> itself, <BrainRegion>posterior parietal association cortex</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>secondary somatosensory cortex</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>motor cortex</BrainRegion>. Labeled neurons were also found in other somatosensory regions corresponding to the trunk, fore- and hindlimb, as well as more distant regions such as the <BrainRegion>visual, rhinal, dorsal peduncular and insular cortices</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>claustrum</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>lateral and basolateral amygdaloid nuclei</BrainRegion>. Further, some mice were injected with the retrograde tracer cholera toxin subunit B to compare retrograde labeling of zincergic neurons with that of the general population of neurons innervating the <BrainRegion>barrel cortex</BrainRegion>. Our data indicate that all <BrainRegion>cortical regions</BrainRegion> providing inputs to the <BrainRegion>barrel cortex</BrainRegion> possess a zincergic component, whereas those from <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> or <BrainRegion>brainstem structures</BrainRegion> do not. These findings demonstrate that zincergic pathways comprise a chemospecific associational network that reciprocally interconnects the <BrainRegion>barrel cortex</BrainRegion> with other <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>limbic structures</BrainRegion>.

<ArticleTitle>Central projections and somatotopic organisation of <BrainRegion>trigeminal</BrainRegion> primary afferents in pigeon (Columba livia).</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Injections of cholera toxin B-chain conjugated to horseradish peroxidase into individual peripheral branches of the <BrainRegion>trigeminal nerve</BrainRegion> or into the <BrainRegion>trigeminal</BrainRegion> ganglion showed that an ascending trigeminal tract (TTA) terminated in distinct <BrainRegion>ventral and dorsal divisions of the principal sensory nucleus</BrainRegion> (PrVv and PrVd, respectively), and a descending tract (TTD) terminated within <BrainRegion>pars oralis</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>pars interpolaris</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>pars caudalis divisions of the nucleus of TTD</BrainRegion> (nTTD) and within the <BrainRegion>dorsal horn of the first six cervical spinal segments</BrainRegion>. In <BrainRegion>PrVd</BrainRegion>, mandibular, ophthalmic, and maxillary projections were predominantly located dorsally, ventrally, and medially, respectively. In <BrainRegion>nucleus of TTD</BrainRegion>(nTTD) , mandibular projections lay dorsomedially, ophthalmic projections lay ventrolaterally, and maxillary projections lay in between. At <BrainRegion>caudal medullary and spinal levels</BrainRegion>, mandibular projections were situated medially, ophthalmic projections were situated laterally, and maxillary projections were situated centrally. The terminations within the <BrainRegion>dorsal horn</BrainRegion> were most dense in laminae III and IV and were least dense in lamina II, with laminae III-IV also receiving topographically organised contralateral projections. <BrainRegion>Extratrigeminal</BrainRegion> projections were mainly to the <BrainRegion>external cuneate nucleus</BrainRegion> by way of a lateral descending trigeminal tract (lTTD; Dubbeldam and Karten [1978] J. Comp. Neurol. 180:661-678) and to the region of the tract of Lissauer and lamina I of the <BrainRegion>dorsal horn</BrainRegion>.

<ArticleTitle>The GABA neurons and their axon terminals in rat <BrainRegion>corpus striatum</BrainRegion> as demonstrated by GAD immunocytochemistry.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD, EC 4.1.1.15), the enzyme which catalyzes the alpha-decarboxylation of L-glutamate to form the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), was localized immunocytochemically in rat <BrainRegion>neostriatum</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>pallidum</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>entopeduncular nucleus</BrainRegion>. A large amount of Glutamic acid decarboxylase(GAD) -positive reaction product was observed in both the <BrainRegion>pallidum</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>entopeduncular nucleus</BrainRegion> in light microscopic preparations and was localized ultrastructurally to axon terminalis that surrounded dendrites and large somata. In the <BrainRegion>neostriatum</BrainRegion> the relative numbers of Glutamic acid decarboxylase(GAD) -positive axons terminals per unit area were substantially less than in the <BrainRegion>pallidum</BrainRegion>. Glutamic acid decarboxylase(GAD) -positive terminals predominantly formed symmetric synapses with somata, dendrites and spines, but a small number of them formed asymmetric synapses with either dendrites or spines. The presence of Glutamic acid decarboxylase(GAD) within these terminals is consistent with results of other investigations which have indicated that the striatopallidal and striatoentopeduncular pathways as well as <BrainRegion>neostriatal</BrainRegion> local circuit neurons and/or collaterals from <BrainRegion>neostriatal</BrainRegion> projection neurons, use gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) as a neurotransmitter. Glutamic acid decarboxylase(GAD) -positive reaction product was also localized within the somata and dendrites of <BrainRegion>neostriatal</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>pallidal</BrainRegion> neurons in colchicine-injected preparations. The Glutamic acid decarboxylase(GAD) -positive somata in the <BrainRegion>pallidum</BrainRegion> were medium-sized neurons and since such cells project to the <BrainRegion>substantia nigra</BrainRegion>, our results are in agreement with those from other studies which demonstrate a gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) ergic, pallidonigral pathway. In the <BrainRegion>neostriatum</BrainRegion>, Glutamic acid decarboxylase(GAD) -positive somata were identified light microscopically as medium-sized neurons with either round or fusiform shapes. Electron microscopic examinations also showed Glutamic acid decarboxylase(GAD) -positive reaction product within the perikaryal and dendritic cytoplasm of these neurons, as well as in dendritic spines. These findings are in accord with the results of studies which have indicated that medium-sized, spinous neurons of the neostriatum give rise to a gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) ergic, striatonigral pathway. The significance of Glutamic acid decarboxylase(GAD) localization within these <BrainRegion>neostriatal</BrainRegion> neurons is discussed in relation to recent findings which show that substance P is contained within this same class of striatonigral projection neuron.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Somatotopic mapping of chordotonal organ neurons in a primitive ensiferan, the New Zealand tree weta Hemideina femorata: II. complex tibial organ.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Most ensiferan insects possess sets of highly specialized chordotonal organs in the proximal tibiae to detect conspecific auditory/vibratory signals or approach of predators. To date, most auditory/vibratory afferents have been classified according to their physiological properties and axonal projection morphology, but not to somatotopic origins. Hence, the functional specialization of identified receptor cells in the tibial organs remains uncertain. To address this question from an anatomical aspect, we investigated the structure of the weta, Hemideina femorata, tibial organs (the most elaborated tibial chordotonal organs among ensiferans) and their central projections by staining small numbers of receptor afferents from identified tibial organs. These organs comprise the &quot;complex tibial organ," including the subgenual organ (primary vibration detector) and its posterior complement, the accessory organ, and the crista acustica (primary auditory organ) and its proximal complement, the intermediate organ. Unlike reports of a membranous organ structure for homologs in other ensiferans, weta tibial organs contain receptor cells embedded in thick solid masses. Primary afferents project ipsilaterally to the medial ventral association center of thoracic ganglia, where axon terminals are arrayed topographically in different areas specific to each organ, except for almost complete overlap of afferents originating from the distal part of the crista acustica and from the intermediate organ. In contrast to somatotopic reflection of sensilla position on limbs, as known for mechanoreceptor hairs, the somatotopic projection map of the insect ear reveals topographic association with acoustic tracheae or tibial cuticular attachment sites, which in turn must reflect determinants of response sensitivity (e.g., frequency or threshold).</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Effects of hypothyroidism upon the granular layer of the <BrainRegion>dentate gyrus</BrainRegion> in male and female adult rats: a morphometric study.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The effects of hypothyroidism upon the structure of the central nervous system of adult rats are poorly understood in spite of evidence that the mature brain is vulnerable to this condition. Existing developmental studies show that the morphological changes induced by thyroid hormone deficiency are related to alterations in neurogenesis. We studied the granular layer of the <BrainRegion>dentate gyrus</BrainRegion> under different experimental conditions of hypothyroidism, because in rodents the neurogenesis of the granule cells continues during adulthood. The following groups of rats were analysed: 1) control; 2) hypothyroid from day 0 until day 180 (hypothyroid group); 3) hypothyroid until day 30 and henceforth maintained euthyroid (recovery group); and 4) hypothyroid since day 30 (adult hypothyroid group). Groups of 6 male rats and 6 female rats were analysed separately. The volume of the <BrainRegion>dentate gyrus</BrainRegion> granular layer and the numerical density of its neurons were evaluated, so we were able to estimate the total number of granule cells. Because in the experimental groups the volume of the granular layer and the numerical density of its neurons were reduced, the total number of granule cells was decreased. In the hypothyroid and recovery groups the alterations were identical and more striking than in the adult hypothyroid groups. The total number of granule cells displayed sexual differences in all groups studied except in the hypothyroid groups. The present results support the view that thyroid hormone deficiency interferes with the process of cell acquisition by reducing neuronal proliferation and that it also leads to increased cell death. These events underlie the irreversible morphological changes observed in the brain of hypothyroid rats, either during development or at maturity. The referred structural alterations are probably related to the functional deficits observed in this condition.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>A population of ascending intersegmental interneurones in the locust with mechanosensory inputs from a hind leg.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>A population of some 35 intersegmental interneurones with somata in the metathoracic ganglion has been characterized by intracellular recording and staining. These interneurones integrate signals from extero- and proprioceptors on a hind leg. The somata are clustered in an anterior and lateral region of the <BrainRegion>dorsal cortex</BrainRegion>, and the axons project to more anterior ganglia in either the ipsilateral or contralateral connectives. Some of these interneurones are excited by afferents from a proprioceptor at the femorotibial joint, the femoral chordotonal organ. An afferent spike evokes a chemically mediated EPSP in an interneurone with a latency and consistency that suggest that the connection is direct. An individual interneurone codes particular features of the movement about the femorotibial joint, responding to flexion, extension, or both directions of movement with either phasic or tonic responses. These interneurones have an extensive field of fine branches ipsilateral to the hind leg from which they receive input. These branches are in lateral and intermediate regions of neuropil to which the afferents of the chordotonal organ also project. Axonal branches, from either an ipsilateral and contralateral axon, are sparse and varicose and occur in dorsal neuropil. Other interneurones are excited by afferents from exteroceptive hairs (trichoid sensilla). An individual interneurone is excited by a particular array of hairs on specific regions of a hind leg. The connections between the afferents and the interneurones appear direct. These interneurones have a dense and compact array of fine branches ipsilateral to the hind leg from which they receive input. These branches are in the most ventral region of neuropil, to which the hair afferents also project. Branches from the ipsilateral axons are sparse and varicose and occur in more dorsal neuropil. The interneurones can thus provide the more anterior ganglia with precise information about the movement of a joint in a hind leg and of the location of an exteroceptive stimulus. This information would be of importance in ensuring the correct co-ordination of the legs during walking.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Transsexual limb transplants in fiddler crabs and expression of novel sensory capabilities.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>We used transsexual limb transplants in fiddler crabs to examine how peripheral sensory structures interact with the central nervous system (CNS) to produce a sexually dimorphic behavior. Female and male chemosensory feeding claws were transplanted onto male hosts in place of nonfeeding, nonchemosensory claws. Successfully transplanted claws retain donor morphologies and contain chemosensory neurons. Neurons in successfully transplanted female feeding claws express the enhanced sensitivity to chemical cues seen in female, but not male, neurons in claws of normal animals. When chemically stimulated, the transplanted claws evoke feeding behavior not observed in normal males, even though the sensory neurons in the transplanted limb project to the host&apos;s sexually dimorphic neuropil not known to receive chemosensory input. Behavioral sensitivity is directly related to the sensitivity of peripheral neurons in the transplanted feeding claw. Thus, the interactions between peripheral neurons and their targets may restructure the central nervous system(CNS) so that novel sensory capabilities are expressed, and this can produce sexually dimorphic behaviors.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Intrahippocampal connections in the pigeon (Columba livia) as revealed by stimulation evoked field potentials.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The <BrainRegion>hippocampal formation</BrainRegion> (HF) of mammals and birds is crucial for spatial learning and memory. However, although the underlying synaptic organization and connectivity of the mammalian <BrainRegion>hippocampal formation</BrainRegion>(HF) are well characterized, comparatively little is known about the avian <BrainRegion>hippocampal formation</BrainRegion>(HF) . Localized regions of the homing pigeon <BrainRegion>hippocampal formation</BrainRegion>(HF) were stimulated at 400-600 microA while evoked field potentials (EFPs) were recorded from adjacent and more distant <BrainRegion>hippocampal formation</BrainRegion>(HF) areas relative to the stimulation site. The shortest discernible EFP latency was 12.2 msec. The emerging connectivity profile (using the location of peak EFP amplitude after stimulation and making no determination of the number of intervening synapses) was characterized by projections from the <BrainRegion>dorsolateral (DL) hippocampal formation</BrainRegion>(HF) to the <BrainRegion>dorsomedial (DM) hippocampal formation</BrainRegion>(HF) (15-msec latency) at the same anterior/posterior (A/P) level, <BrainRegion>dorsomedial</BrainRegion>(DM) to <BrainRegion>ventrolateral</BrainRegion> (VL) and <BrainRegion>ventromedial (VM; 15 msec) hippocampal formation</BrainRegion>(HF) across anterior/posterior(A/P) levels, <BrainRegion>ventromedial</BrainRegion>(VM) to <BrainRegion>ventrolateral</BrainRegion>(VL) (12 msec) and <BrainRegion>contralateral ventromedial</BrainRegion>(VM) (15 msec) at the same anterior/posterior(A/P) level, and <BrainRegion>ventrolateral</BrainRegion>(VL) to <BrainRegion>ventral dorsolateral</BrainRegion>(DL) ( dorsolateral(DL) v; 15 msec) across anterior/posterior(A/P) levels posterior to the stimulation site. Using these data as a first approximation, connectivity through the avian <BrainRegion>hippocampal formation</BrainRegion>(HF) appears to be characterized by a discernible feed-forward network starting with a projection from <BrainRegion>dorsolateral</BrainRegion>(DL) to <BrainRegion>dorsomedial</BrainRegion>(DM) , <BrainRegion>dorsomedial</BrainRegion>(DM) to <BrainRegion>ventrolateral</BrainRegion>(VL) , <BrainRegion>ventromedial</BrainRegion>(VM) , and <BrainRegion>contralateral ventromedial</BrainRegion>(VM) , <BrainRegion>ventromedial</BrainRegion>(VM) to <BrainRegion>ventrolateral</BrainRegion>(VL) , and <BrainRegion>ventrolateral</BrainRegion>(VL) to <BrainRegion>posterior ventral dorsolateral</BrainRegion>(DL) v. Although still speculative, the results suggest that the internal connectivity of the avian <BrainRegion>hippocampal formation</BrainRegion>(HF) is similar to that of the mammalian <BrainRegion>hippocampal formation</BrainRegion>(HF) , despite the large evolutionary divergence between the two taxa.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Thermotaxis and thermosensory neurons in infective larvae of Haemonchus contortus, a passively ingested nematode parasite.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>As a basis for studies of thermal behavior of infective larvae (L3) of Haemonchus contortus resulting from ablation of amphidial neurons, the locations of the amphidial cell bodies in the hatchling larva (L1) were compared with their locations in the L3. We sought to verify that killing each targeted cell body in L1 destroys the putative corresponding dendrite of the L3. These comparisons confirmed the predicted cell body-to-dendrite connections, as well as similarities in the general amphidial structure of the two stages. We then conducted a series of studies using laser microbeam ablation of amphidial cell bodies in the L1 to determine the role of specific neurons in the thermal behavior of the L3. In a thermal gradient, normal L3 of H. contortus migrate to the temperature at which they were cultured and/or maintained. Larvae grown at 16 degrees or 26 degrees C migrate appropriately to either of these temperatures. Larvae grown to the L3 stage at 16 degrees C and then moved to 26 degrees C become acclimated to this temperature and thereafter migrate to it. However, when the putative thermosensory neurons, the finger cell neurons (AFD), were ablated in hatchling larvae with a laser microbeam, and these were grown to the L3 stage and tested on a radial thermal gradient, they failed to migrate to their culture temperature. Instead, they moved actively and continuously over much of the assay plate surface, with no obviously oriented cryo- or thermotactic movement. Ablation-control larvae, those in which putatively chemosensory neuron classes ASE or AWC were killed, migrated normally to their culture temperature. When the RIA interneurons (identified by positional homology with those of Caenorhabditis elegans) were ablated, the operated larvae moved actively, but circled near the initial placement point; control larvae, in which other nonamphidial neurons were killed, migrated normally. These results indicate that the finger cell neurons (AFD) are the primary thermosensory class in H. contortus. The RIA-class neurons integrate thermal responses in H. contortus, as do their putative structural homologs in C. elegans, but the behavior of H. contortus subsequent to RIA ablation is strikingly different.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Distribution of certain peptide-containing nerve fibres and endocrine cells in the gastrointestinal mucosa in five mammalian species.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The distribution of mucosal nerve fibres containing vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), substance P, somatostatin, neuropeptide Y (NPY), and enkephalinlike immunoreactivity was mapped by conventional immunohistochemical techniques throughout the mucosa of the esophagus, stomach, small and large intestines, and gall bladder. In addition, the distributions of endocrine cells immunoreactive for three peptides localized by these antisera (namely somatostatin, pancreatic polypeptide, and substance P) were recorded. Tissues from guinea pigs, rats, dogs, marmosets, and humans were studied. It was hoped that this information would enable possible target tissues and functional roles for the peptides to be identified. In the mucosa, peptide nerve fibres were found throughout the lamina propria, including some which were close to the epithelium and others associated with small blood vessels. Although there was a general similarity of peptide nerve distribution between regions and species, many small variations were observed. vasoactive intestinal peptide(VIP) and substance P fibres were the most prevalent nerve type; neuropeptide Y(NPY) fibres were also usually quite common. The distribution of somatostatin fibres was extremely variable between regions and species, and enkephalin fibres were usually rare. Endocrine cells of open (flask- or pyramid-shaped) and closed (rounded) types were seen; basal cytoplasmic processes (of variable length) were seen on many cells immunoreactive for somatostatin or pancreatic polypeptide. Epithelial cells immunoreactive for substance P were seen in the dog, marmoset, and human. The distributions and shapes of endocrine cells varied widely between areas and species. These studies provide a basis for the correlation of nerve distribution with pharmacological and physiological studies.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Amygdaloid</BrainRegion> efferents through the <BrainRegion>stria terminalis</BrainRegion> in the rat give origin to zinc-containing boutons.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Many regions of the <BrainRegion>basal forebrain</BrainRegion> are innervated by zinc-containing axonal boutons. In the present work, the lesion/degeneration method, coupled with histochemical staining for zinc-containing boutons, was used to determine the origins and efferent pathways of these zinc-containing projections to the <BrainRegion>basal forebrain</BrainRegion>. Knife cuts of the <BrainRegion>stria terminalis</BrainRegion> or extensive electrolytic lesions of the <BrainRegion>amygdala</BrainRegion> resulted in the bleaching of the staining for zinc (Timm stain) and terminal degeneration (Fink-Heimer method) ipsilaterally in the following areas: granule cell layer of the <BrainRegion>accessory olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>, shell of <BrainRegion>nucleus accumbens</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>bed nucleus of the stria terminalis</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>striohypothalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>retrochiasmatic area</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus</BrainRegion> (in the cell-sparse shell), <BrainRegion>medial tuberal nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>terete hypothalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>ventral premammillary nucleus</BrainRegion>. Small lesions made with ibotenic acid in the <BrainRegion>posteromedial part of the amygdalohippocampal area</BrainRegion> caused bleaching of the stain for zinc in the <BrainRegion>accessory olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>, in the medial zone of the <BrainRegion>bed nucleus of the stria terminalis</BrainRegion>, and in the <BrainRegion>ventral premammillary nucleus</BrainRegion>. Lesions in either the <BrainRegion>ventral subiculum</BrainRegion> or the <BrainRegion>anterolateral part of the amygdalohippocampal area</BrainRegion> caused bleaching in the <BrainRegion>ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>. Lesions in the <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion> or in the <BrainRegion>neocortex</BrainRegion> did not produce bleaching of the stain for zinc in the above-mentioned terminal fields. The present results agree with previous studies on <BrainRegion>amygdaloid</BrainRegion> efferents and suggest that neurons in the <BrainRegion>amygdalohippocampal area</BrainRegion> and, possibly, in the <BrainRegion>ventral subiculum</BrainRegion> give origin to zinc-containing boutons.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>GABA- and glycine-immunoreactive neurons in the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> of the carp, Cyprinus carpio.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glycine are the two main inhibitory transmitter amino acids in the central nervous system of vertebrates. The distribution of cells containing GABA and glycine in the carp <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> was examined by using specific antisera raised against the two amino acids conjugated to bovine serum albumin. The immunoreaction on serial paraffin sections was visualized by a streptavidin-biotin method. Both antisera gave highly specific labelings of cells. At least three types of GABA-immunoreactive cells were found. They were small cells in the dorsal grey matter, various sized cells in the central and ventral grey, and some ependymal cells contacting the <BrainRegion>central canal</BrainRegion>. In addition, very small cells and neuropil structures in the <BrainRegion>dorsal horn</BrainRegion> were strongly immunoreactive to the GABA serum. Certain cells in the <BrainRegion>ventral horn</BrainRegion> have moderate numbers of labelled synaptic boutons on the perikarya, but very few GABA-labelled terminals were found on putative motoneurons. The immunoreactive ependymal cells appeared to have a ventrolaterally directed axon. The glycine antiserum labelled small and intermediate cells in the dorsal grey, large, elongated cells in the median region, and varying sized cells in the ventral grey. The numbers and density of immunoreactive cells and neuropil structures in the <BrainRegion>ventral horn</BrainRegion> were fewer and lower than in GABA-stained sections. The median large cells had a thick ventrolateral process. The ventral intermediate cells were often found near putative motoneurons. Labelled synaptic boutons were present on most ventral cells including putative motoneurons and interneurons. Abundant distribution of cells immunoreactive to both antisera suggest important roles of both GABA and glycine as neurotransmitters for controlling swimming movements in teleosts.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Barrelettes--architectonic vibrissal representations in the <BrainRegion>brainstem trigeminal complex</BrainRegion> of the mouse. II. Normal post-natal development.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Vibrissal representations in the <BrainRegion>brainstem trigeminal complex</BrainRegion> (BTC) of rodents are manifested as architectural sub-units called barrelettes. The development of barrelettes was studied by using Nissl staining, cytochrome oxidase histochemistry, and Golgi-impregnation methods. On the day of birth (PND-1), barrelettes are manifested as longitudinal, histochemical cylinders in <BrainRegion>sub-nuclei principalis</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>interpolaris and caudalis of the brainstem trigeminal complex</BrainRegion>(BTC) . One day later (PND-2), fully formed histochemical barrelette formations are seen in the three sub-nuclei. The development of cytoarchitectural barrelettes lags behind histochemical barrelettes by about two days. Between PND-2 and PND-3, longitudinal cytoarchitectonic cylinders begin to appear. By PND-3, <BrainRegion>brainstem trigeminal complex</BrainRegion>(BTC) neurons segregate into five rows of barrelettes in the coronal plane. Segmentation of rows into individual barrelettes begins on PND-4, and complete cytoarchitectonic barrelette formations are seen by PND-5. Golgi-impregnation shows that on the day of birth, primary afferent terminals and dendritic arbors of second-order trigeminal neurons within the <BrainRegion>brainstem trigeminal complex</BrainRegion>(BTC) are short and poorly ramified. Over the next five post-natal days, lengthening of these processes as well as elaboration into secondary and tertiary branches take place. Growth of these processes continues for two additional weeks, contributing to the increase in barrelette neuropils (hollows). As the neuropils expand, neuronal somata are pushed toward barrelette sides. Morphometric measurements show that there is a relatively constant rate of growth of barrelettes over the first three post-natal weeks. The growth rate of the barrelette formations is identical to that of <BrainRegion>brainstem trigeminal complex</BrainRegion>(BTC) as a whole. Thus, at the time of birth, the volume of neural tissue in the <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion> allotted to vibrissae is fixed relative to that allotted to other sensory receptors. Several features of the early development of barrelettes are identified: (1) Chemoarchitectural barrelettes appear before cytoarchitectural barrelettes, suggesting that terminal arbors of <BrainRegion>primary trigeminal</BrainRegion> afferents are organized before their target neurons form barrelettes. (2) Early cytoarchitecture is manifested in the form of unsegmented rows, suggesting that rough, row-based topological maps are first formed, which are then fine-tuned into individual sub-units. Recent evidence shows that other vibrissal representations--<BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> barreloids and <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> barrels--also follow these &quot;afferent-before-target" and "row-before-individual units" sequences of development. This gradual, afferent-dependent fine-tuning of topological organization is analogous to similar events during the early development of the visual system, and may be a general feature of developing sensory systems.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>The effect of <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>tectal</BrainRegion> lesions on the visual fields of binocularly deprived cats.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The visual fields of seven cats raised with binocular lid suture were measured before and after various neural lesions. Each of the cats preoperatively responded with each eye to stimuli from 90 degrees ipsilateral through to the midline. A transection of the <BrainRegion>optic chiasm</BrainRegion> rendered one cat blind on the visual field tests. Large bilateral occipito-temporal cortical ablations (4 cats) did not measurably affect orienting responses or the extent of visual field. Unilateral occipito-temporal cortical ablations (2 cats) also had no affect on the visual fields, but subsequent ablations of the <BrainRegion>contralateral superior colliculus</BrainRegion> produced permanent blindness in the hemifield contralateral to the ablated <BrainRegion>tectum</BrainRegion>. These two cats also were apparently blind with the eye contralateral to the ablated <BrainRegion>tectum</BrainRegion>; but with the other eye, the cats retained their preoperative orienting responses. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that, with early binocular deprivation, cats develop dependence upon retinotectal and not thalamocortical pathways for visually guided orienting behavior.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>A light and electron microscopic study of the effects of 3-acetylpyridine intoxication on the <BrainRegion>inferior olivary complex</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>cerebellar cortex</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The effects of 3-acetylpyridine (3-AP) intoxication on the <BrainRegion>inferior olivary complex</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>cerebellar cortex</BrainRegion> of the rat were examined at both the light and electron microscopic level. Following intraperitoneal injection of 65 mg of 3-acetylpyridine(3-AP) per kg body weight, the <BrainRegion>inferior olivary</BrainRegion> neurons were observed to undergo a rapid form of electron dense degeneration. A complete bilateral involvement of the <BrainRegion>nuclear complex</BrainRegion> was well advanced as early as 12 hours following injection. Marked astrocytic proliferation also occurred by 12 hours and appeared essential for neuronal fragmentation and disintegration. Microglial activity was prominent in the later stages, from 60 hours onwards, and participated in the phagocytic removal of degenerating neuronal fragments. By the end of the second week, all cytoplasmic and nuclear debri was removed. Concurrently, degenerative changes in the <BrainRegion>cerebellar cortex</BrainRegion> were evident from 12 hours onwards. All climbing fiber varicosities were observed to be degenerative as early as 24 hours following treatment. Electron microscopic observations revealed that these electron dense fragments were largely phagocytized and cleared by Bergmann glial cells around 7 days. The sensitivity of the olivocerebellar system to 3-acetylpyridine(3-AP) thus provides a convenient and selective means of eliminating all of the <BrainRegion>inferior olivary</BrainRegion> neurons and their axons, the climbing fibers of the <BrainRegion>cerebellar cortex</BrainRegion>. In contrast to the more conventionally used electrolytic methods, 3-acetylpyridine(3-AP) causes a complete bilateral ablation of all <BrainRegion>olivary</BrainRegion> neurons while avoiding the problems inherent to electrolytic procedures, such as incomplete destruction of the nucleus and involvement of fibers of passage.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>The return of phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated epitopes of neurofilament proteins to the regenerating <BrainRegion>optic nerve</BrainRegion> of Xenopus laevis.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Neurofilament proteins of mammalian axotomized peripheral axons, which regenerate effectively, resemble those of embryonic axons. However, injured centrally projecting mammalian axons, which fail to regenerate, have very different neurofilament compositions than during development. If changes in neurofilament composition after injury reflect the ability of axotomized neurons to regenerate effectively, then the neurofilaments of centrally projecting axons that can regenerate should more closely resemble those of developing axons. In this study, the neurofilament compositions of injured optic axons of the frog, Xenopus laevis, were examined, since these axons can regenerate a fully functional projection. Antibodies to phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms of neurofilament proteins that had been used previously to study the neurofilament composition of newly developing X. laevis optic axons were used in immunocytochemical studies to examine the return of neurofilaments to the <BrainRegion>optic nerve</BrainRegion> after an intraorbital nerve crush. Intraocularly injected wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase was used to label the regenerating axons independently of their neurofilaments. Neurofilament immunoreactivities disappeared rapidly from crushed axons during the first week after surgery. By nine days after surgery, antibodies to nonphosphorylated forms of middle (NF-M) and low molecular weight (NF-L) neurofilament proteins and the Xenopus neuronal intermediate filament protein (XNIF) began to stain the nerve just beyond the lesion. By this time, however, growing axonal terminals had reached the <BrainRegion>optic chiasm</BrainRegion>. Antibodies to phosphorylated epitopes of nonphosphorylated forms of middle(NF-M) began to stain axons at 15 days, just as growing axons began to arrive at the <BrainRegion>optic tectum</BrainRegion>. Nonphosphorylated high molecular weight neurofilament protein (NF-H) began to appear in axons between 18 and 21 days after surgery. Thus, the reappearance of neurofilaments during optic axon regeneration resembled the general pattern seen during development. The chief difference between development and regeneration was that neurofilament epitopes took longer to emerge during regeneration. One possibility is that cues encountered along the optic pathway influence the neurofilament composition of retinal ganglion cell axons. Then, the greater distances travelled by regenerating axons could account for the longer time taken for their neurofilament compositions to mature.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Cerebral</BrainRegion> arterial innervation by nerve fibers containing calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP): I. Distribution and origin of CGRP perivascular innervation in the rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The origin, density and distribution of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) immunoreactivity in <BrainRegion>cerebral perivascular nerves</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>trigeminal</BrainRegion> ganglion of rats were examined in this study. calcitonin gene-related peptide(CGRP) immunoreactive axons were abundant on the walls of the rostral circulation of the major <BrainRegion>cerebral</BrainRegion> arteries in the circle of Willis. The fibers form a grid- or meshwork of longitudinal and circumferential axons studded with numerous varicose swellings. The density of calcitonin gene-related peptide(CGRP) fibers was particularly high at the bifurcation of major arteries. A few calcitonin gene-related peptide(CGRP) fibers cross the midline to innervate arteries on the contralateral side of the arterial tree. The arteries of the caudal circulation were sparsely innervated by calcitonin gene-related peptide(CGRP) fibers. In the <BrainRegion>trigeminal</BrainRegion> ganglion, about 30% of the ganglion cells had calcitonin gene-related peptide(CGRP) immunoreactivity. The cell size of most (75%) of calcitonin gene-related peptide(CGRP) neurons was less than 30 micron in diameter. There was no significant difference in staining density between small and large calcitonin gene-related peptide(CGRP) neurons. Unilateral transection of the maxillary and mandibular divisions of the <BrainRegion>trigeminal nerve</BrainRegion> caused a substantial decrease of calcitonin gene-related peptide(CGRP) immunoreactivity in the ipsilateral dorsal two-thirds of the <BrainRegion>trigeminal nucleus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>cervical spinal cord</BrainRegion> but did not noticeably change the diameter of the vascular lumen or the densities of calcitonin gene-related peptide(CGRP) fibers in the walls of the <BrainRegion>cerebral</BrainRegion> arteries. In contrast, unilateral transection that included the <BrainRegion>ophthalmic division</BrainRegion> eliminated calcitonin gene-related peptide(CGRP) fibers on the ipsilateral <BrainRegion>cerebral</BrainRegion> arteries and eliminated calcitonin gene-related peptide(CGRP) immunoreactivity throughout the <BrainRegion>trigeminal nucleus</BrainRegion> in the <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>rostral cervical cord</BrainRegion>. In addition, these lesions caused a significant reduction in the diameter of the denervated arteries. The present study demonstrates that calcitonin gene-related peptide(CGRP) , a putative neurotransmitter/neuromodulator, is especially abundant in the <BrainRegion>rostral cerebral</BrainRegion> circulation and is derived from the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve</BrainRegion>. In addition, the loss of calcitonin gene-related peptide(CGRP) <BrainRegion>perivascular nerves</BrainRegion> is associated with a reduction of the arterial lumen. This suggests that calcitonin gene-related peptide(CGRP) is a strong candidate as a nerve-derived trophic factor at <BrainRegion>trigeminal</BrainRegion> terminals and provides additional evidence that calcitonin gene-related peptide(CGRP) is a component in the trigeminovascular system influencing vascular diameter.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Neuronal organization in fly <BrainRegion>optic lobes</BrainRegion> altered by laser ablations early in development or by mutations of the eye.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The role of afferent and efferent connections in the differentiation of <BrainRegion>optic lobe</BrainRegion> interneurons was investigated by using laser ablations of neuronal precursors in the brain of Musca domestica and analysis of two eye mutants of the same species. The first mutant, split eye, had no connections between the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>optic lobes</BrainRegion>. In this case the <BrainRegion>optic lobes</BrainRegion> were drastically reduced in volume and the neural organization within the neuropil regions was altered. The other mutant, spindle, had reduced <BrainRegion>retinae</BrainRegion> that innervated reduced <BrainRegion>optic lobes</BrainRegion> with a normal-appearing orderly arrangement of neurons. In addition disordered neuropil, composed of identified visual interneurons, was found that had no afferent innervation. Three main types of alterations resulting from laser ablations were analyzed. These ablations removed entire neuropil regions or parts of these: (1) removal of the first optic neuropil region (the lamina) resulting in receptor axons projecting directly to the second neuropil (the medulla) and sprouting of medulla neurons toward the receptor layer; (2) removal of one part of the third optic neuropil (the lobula plate) and severe alteration of the other part (the lobula) resulting in sprouting of lobula neurons into the medulla neuropil; and (3) removal of the entire <BrainRegion>optic lobe</BrainRegion> resulting in reduction of the volume of the <BrainRegion>lateral midbrain</BrainRegion> and photoreceptor axons forming a tangle beneath the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>. Our findings confirm that afferent <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> input is essential for normal differentiation and maintenance of many <BrainRegion>optic lobe</BrainRegion> interneurons. Furthermore, it was seen that a normal columnar organization of the neuropils and the dendritic patterns of visual interneurons are dependent on afferent inputs. A common response to removal of inputs was a reorganization of axonal and dendritic projections.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>The organization of certain afferents to the <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>dentate gyrus</BrainRegion> in normal and reeler mice.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The organization of certain of the major afferents to the <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>dentate gyrus</BrainRegion> has been studied in normal and reeler mutant mice using the autoradiographic and the anterograde degeneration methods. The distribution of the <BrainRegion>hippocampal</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>dentate</BrainRegion> afferents which arise in the <BrainRegion>medial and lateral parts of the entorhinal cortex</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion> of both sides, has been found to be generally similar to that previously described in the rat, but there are a few minor differences that are discussed in the text. Despite the marked ectopia of many of the neurons in the <BrainRegion>hippocampal formation</BrainRegion> in the reeler mouse, the principal afferents to the <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>dentate gyrus</BrainRegion> maintain many of the features seen in normal mice. In particular, they maintain a normal radial sequence and a characteristic laminated and complementary arrangement. However, there are a number of significant differences in their distribution; for example, in the reeler mouse, the <BrainRegion>entorhinal</BrainRegion> afferents occupy the entire radial extent of the <BrainRegion>stratum moleculare of the dentate gyrus</BrainRegion>, whereas in normal mice they are restricted to the outer four-fifths of this layer. Furthermore, in the mutant the commissural and associational afferents to the <BrainRegion>dentate gyrus</BrainRegion> do not occupy the inner one-fifth of the molecular layer (as they do in normal animals) but rather are spread throughout the zone containing granule cells, which includes both the poorly-defined <BrainRegion>stratum granulosum</BrainRegion> and most of the <BrainRegion>hilar region of the dentate gyrus</BrainRegion>. Some of the developmental and functional implications of these and other abnormalities in the organization of the afferents to the <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>dentate gyrus</BrainRegion> are discussed.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Organization of <BrainRegion>inferior olivary</BrainRegion> projections to the <BrainRegion>flocculus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>ventral paraflocculus</BrainRegion> of the rat <BrainRegion>cerebellum</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The climbing fiber projection to the rat <BrainRegion>flocculus</BrainRegion> and adjacent <BrainRegion>ventral paraflocculus</BrainRegion> was investigated by using Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin as an anterograde and horseradish peroxidase as a retrograde tracer. Large injections of horseradish peroxidase in the <BrainRegion>flocculus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>ventral paraflocculus</BrainRegion> indicated that the climbing fibers to this region are derived exclusively from any of the following <BrainRegion>contralateral olivary regions</BrainRegion>: the <BrainRegion>dorsal cap of Kooy</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>ventrolateral outgrowth</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>caudal half of the ventral leaf of the principal olive</BrainRegion> near its lateral bend, and the <BrainRegion>rostral pole of the medial accessory olive</BrainRegion>. Subsequent anterograde and retrograde studies with small injections demonstrated that the latter area projects to the <BrainRegion>C2 zone</BrainRegion>, which runs caudally in the <BrainRegion>ventral paraflocculus</BrainRegion> and enters the caudal most aspect of the <BrainRegion>flocculus</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>ventral leaf of the principal olive</BrainRegion> is connected to a <BrainRegion>D zone in the cerebellar hemisphere and paraflocculus</BrainRegion>, which, upon entering the <BrainRegion>ventral paraflocculus</BrainRegion>, divides into a caudal and rostral strip, termed <BrainRegion>FD</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>FD</BrainRegion>&apos;, respectively. The <BrainRegion>dorsal cap</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>ventrolateral outgrowth</BrainRegion> each project to two distinct zones in the <BrainRegion>flocculus</BrainRegion> and part of the <BrainRegion>ventral paraflocculus</BrainRegion>. Two <BrainRegion>floccular zones</BrainRegion>, which are continuous with the <BrainRegion>parafloccular FD and FD&apos; zones</BrainRegion>, receive their climbing fibers from the <BrainRegion>ventrolateral outgrowth</BrainRegion>. Two other zones, (<BrainRegion>FE and FE&apos;</BrainRegion>) receive their climbing fibers from the <BrainRegion>dorsal cap</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>FE&apos; zone</BrainRegion> is found at the <BrainRegion>rostral pole of the flocculus</BrainRegion> and is followed caudalwards by the <BrainRegion>FD&apos;</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>FE</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>FD</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>C2 zones</BrainRegion>, respectively. The <BrainRegion>rostromedial part of the dorsal cap</BrainRegion> is connected to the continuation of the <BrainRegion>FE zone</BrainRegion> into the <BrainRegion>ventral paraflocculus</BrainRegion>. The observation that the <BrainRegion>dorsal cap</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>ventrolateral outgrowth</BrainRegion> are both connected to a set of two alternating zones of <BrainRegion>floccular/ventral parafloccular</BrainRegion> Purkinje cells is in agreement with recent studies in the rabbit, and suggests that these zones reflect functionally distinct and discrete units related to specific aspects of visuomotor control.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Layer V in cat <BrainRegion>primary auditory cortex</BrainRegion> (AI): cellular architecture and identification of projection neurons.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The cytoarchitectonic organization and the structure of layer V neuronal populations in cat <BrainRegion>primary auditory cortex</BrainRegion> (AI) were analyzed in Golgi, Nissl, immunocytochemical, and plastic-embedded preparations from mature specimens. The major cell types were characterized as a prelude to identifying their connections with the <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>midbrain</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>cerebral cortex</BrainRegion> using axoplasmic transport methods. The goal was to describe the structure and connections of layer V neurons more fully. Layer V has three sublayers based on the types of neuron and their sublaminar projections. Four types of pyramidal and three kinds of nonpyramidal cells were present. Classic pyramidal cells had a long apical dendrite, robust basal arbors, and an axon with both local and corticofugal projections. Only the largest pyramidal cell apical dendrites reached the supragranular layers, and their somata were found mainly in layer Vb. Three types departed from the classic pattern; these were the star, fusiform, and inverted pyramidal neurons. Nonpyramidal cells ranged from large multipolar neurons with radiating dendrites, to Martinotti cells, with smooth dendrites and a primary trunk oriented toward the white matter. Many nonpyramidal cells were multipolar, of which three subtypes (large, medium, and small) were identified; bipolar and other types also were seen. Their axons formed local projections within layer V, often near pyramidal neurons. Several features distinguish layer V from other layers in auditory cortex(<BrainRegion>AI</BrainRegion>) . The largest pyramidal neurons were in layer V. Layer V neuronal diversity aligns it with layer VI (Prieto and Winer [1999] J. Comp. Neurol. 404:332--358), and it is consistent with the many connectional systems in layer V, each of which has specific sublaminar and neuronal origins. The infragranular layers are the source for several parallel descending systems. There were significant differences in somatic size among these projection neurons. This finding implies that diverse corticofugal roles in sensorimotor processing may require a correspondingly wide range of neuronal architecture.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Region-specific distribution of catecholamine afferents in primate <BrainRegion>cerebral cortex</BrainRegion>: a fluorescence histochemical analysis.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The density, laminar distribution, spatial orientation, and intrahemispheric pathways of norepinephrine (NE)- and dopamine (DA)- containing axons were analyzed in a wide range of cytoarchitectonically distinct areas of <BrainRegion>cerebral cortex</BrainRegion> in the adult rhesus monkey by fluorescence histochemistry. Although the boundaries between most areas were rarely sharp, there were marked regional differences in density and distribution of monoamine afferents in different <BrainRegion>cortical regions</BrainRegion>. Fibers exhibiting typical dopamine(DA) -like morphology were found only in the <BrainRegion>temporal and frontal lobes</BrainRegion> including <BrainRegion>motor and premotor areas</BrainRegion> as well as <BrainRegion>anterior cingulate</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>prefrontal cortices</BrainRegion>. In contrast, norepinephrine(NE) -containing axons were present in all <BrainRegion>cerebral lobes</BrainRegion>, with notably high density in the <BrainRegion>somatosensory area</BrainRegion> and low numbers in <BrainRegion>primary visual cortex</BrainRegion>. Intracerebral distribution was characterized by a network of large preterminal axons coursing both anteroposteriorly and mediolaterally in layer VI and in the subjacent white matter. In most cytoarchitectonic regions examined, catecholamine (CA)-containing axons exhibited a bilaminar distribution into one superficial and one deep fiber band. The location and width of the two dense bands, as well as the orientation and relative density of fibers within them, was region specific. Although fluorescent axons were found at all <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> depths, layers I, and IV usually contained relatively few fluorescent axons while layers II-III and IV-V were often densely innervated. An observation that may reflect a specialization in <BrainRegion>gyrencephalic</BrainRegion> brains is the particularly dense catecholamine(CA) innervation around <BrainRegion>sulcal invaginations in all cerebral lobes</BrainRegion>. The present results confirm previous biochemical evidence of regional heterogeneity in the concentration of dopamine(DA) and norepinephrine(NE) in the primate <BrainRegion>neocortex</BrainRegion> (Brown and Goldman, &apos;77:Brain Res. 124:576-550) an provide the first anatomical demonstration of corresponding differences in the pattern and density of catecholamine(CA) innervation in diverse cytoarchitectonic areas in rhesus monkey. These findings raise the possibility of selective targets and functions for catecholamine(CA) fibers in different layers and regions of the <BrainRegion>primate cortex</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Ultrastructural localization of beta-arrestin-1 and -2 in rat <BrainRegion>lumbar spinal cord</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>beta-arrestins play significant roles in agonist-mediated desensitization of G protein-coupled receptors. Although the presence of beta-arrestin subtypes, beta-arrestin-1 and(- 2) in rat brain has been studied extensively, their existence in the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> has not been described. In the current study, we performed immunohistochemical analyses of beta-arrestins at both light and electron microscopic levels using rat <BrainRegion>lumbar 1-2 spinal cord segments</BrainRegion>. Intense immunoreactivity for beta-arrestin-1 was found in the motoneurons in <BrainRegion>lamina IX of the ventral horn</BrainRegion> and elongated cells in the <BrainRegion>dorsal nucleus of Clarke</BrainRegion>. Modest immunoreactivity was detected among the neurons of laminae V and VII/VIII, and weaker immunoreactivity in laminae III, IV, and X. beta-arrestin-2 immunoreactivity was also distributed through laminae III-X in the order of IX &amp;gt; dorsal nucleus of Clarke &gt; V &gt; VII/VIII &gt; IV &gt; III &gt; X. Laminae I and II did not show immunoreactivity. At the electron microscopic level, both beta-arrestin-immunoreactive and nonimmunoreactive dendrites were observed, whereas axons and terminal boutons were devoid of immunoreactivity. In immunoreactive dendrites most beta-arrestin immunoreactivity was distributed throughout the cytoplasm, demonstrating their association with microtubules. In addition, strong immunoreactivity was often found at postsynaptic densities. Our results thus suggest beta-arrestins' possible involvement in both motor and sensory mechanisms at the postsynaptic level in rat <BrainRegion>lumbar spinal cord</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Distribution of keratin 8-containing cell clusters in mouse embryonic tongue: evidence for a prepattern for taste bud development.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The initiation of the morphogenesis of gustatory papillae is independent of innervation. To address the question of whether taste bud formation is associated with gustatory papilla morphogenesis, we examined developing tongues in mouse embryos from embryonic day 11 to birth. Despite the smooth morphological appearance of the lingual dorsal surface at 13 days of gestation, we observed embryonic taste bud primordia as discrete collections of cytokeratin 8-positive and elongated cells in epithelial placodes in the anterior tongue. In subsequent stages until birth, cytokeratin 8 continues to be expressed in embryonic taste buds distributed in punctuate patterns at regular intervals along rows that are symmetrically located on both sides of the median sulcus in the dorsal anterior developing tongue. Embryonic taste buds were observed in the developing circumvallate papillae from 15.5 days of gestation until birth. The dorsal epithelium of the anterior tongue is not innervated when embryonic taste buds first occur. The increased numbers of embryonic taste buds in developing fungiform papillae until birth are not correlated with the neural invasion of the epithelium. Thus, taste buds occur prenatally more likely independently of the innervation.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Physiological and morphological diversity of immunocytochemically defined parvalbumin- and cholecystokinin-positive interneurones in <BrainRegion>CA1</BrainRegion> of the adult rat <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>To investigate the electrophysiological properties, synaptic connections, and anatomy of individual parvalbumin-immunoreactive (PV-IR) and cholecystokinin-immunoreactive (CCK-IR) interneurones in <BrainRegion>CA1</BrainRegion>, dual intracellular recordings using biocytin-filled microelectrodes in slices of adult rat <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion> were combined with fluorescence labelling of PV- and CCK-containing cells. Of 36 parvalbumin-immunoreactive(PV-IR) cells, 29 were basket cells, with most of their axonal arbours in the <BrainRegion>stratum pyramidale</BrainRegion> (SP). Six were bistratified cells with axons ramifying throughout <BrainRegion>stratum oriens</BrainRegion> (SO) and <BrainRegion>stratum radiatum</BrainRegion> (SR). One was a putative axo-axonic cell with an axonal arbour confined to half of the <BrainRegion>stratum pyramidale</BrainRegion>(SP) and a narrow adjacent region of the <BrainRegion>stratum oriens</BrainRegion>(SO) . Of 27 cholecystokinin-immunoreactive(CCK-IR) neurones, 13 were basket cells, with most of their axonal arbours in the <BrainRegion>stratum pyramidale</BrainRegion>(SP) , and included basket cells with somata in the <BrainRegion>stratum pyramidale</BrainRegion>(SP) (6), <BrainRegion>stratum oriens</BrainRegion>(SO) (3), and <BrainRegion>stratum radiatum</BrainRegion>(SR) (2) and at the border between the <BrainRegion>stratum lacunosum-moleculare</BrainRegion> (SLM) and the <BrainRegion>stratum radiatum</BrainRegion>(SR) (2). In addition, several dendrite-targeting cell classes expressed cholecystokinin-immunoreactive(CCK-IR) : 4 of 9 bistratified cells with axons ramifying in the <BrainRegion>stratum oriens</BrainRegion>(SO) and <BrainRegion>stratum radiatum</BrainRegion>(SR) ; all five Schaffer-associated cells whose axons ramified extensively in the <BrainRegion>stratum radiatum</BrainRegion>(SR) ; both cells classified as quadrilaminar because their axons ramified in the <BrainRegion>stratum oriens</BrainRegion>(SO) , <BrainRegion>stratum pyramidale</BrainRegion>(SP) , <BrainRegion>stratum radiatum</BrainRegion>(SR) , and <BrainRegion>stratum lacunosum-moleculare</BrainRegion>(SLM) ; one <BrainRegion>stratum oriens</BrainRegion>(SO) - <BrainRegion>stratum oriens</BrainRegion>(SO) cell whose dendritic and axonal arbours were contained within the <BrainRegion>stratum oriens</BrainRegion>(SO) ; and one perforant path-associated cell with axonal and dendritic arbours within the <BrainRegion>distal stratum radiatum</BrainRegion>(SR) and <BrainRegion>stratum lacunosum-moleculare</BrainRegion>(SLM) . The majority (31 of 36) of parvalbumin-immunoreactive(PV-IR) neurones recorded were fast-spiking, and most fast-spiking cells tested (25 of 29 basket, 1 axo-axonic, and 5 of 6 bistratified cells) were parvalbumin-immunoreactive(PV-IR) . However, 1 of 6 regular-spiking basket, 1 of 4 regular-spiking bistratified, and 3 of 5 burst-firing basket cells were also parvalbumin-immunoreactive(PV-IR) . In contrast, the majority (17 of 27) of the cholecystokinin-immunoreactive(CCK-IR) neurones recorded were regular-spiking, 3 were burst-firing, and 7 were fast-spiking. These data confirm that the majority of parvalbumin-immunoreactive(PV-IR) and cholecystokinin-immunoreactive(CCK-IR) axon terminals innervate proximal portions of <BrainRegion>CA1</BrainRegion> pyramidal cells. Most parvalbumin-immunoreactive(PV-IR) cells are fast-spiking, whereas most cholecystokinin-immunoreactive(CCK-IR) cells are regular-spiking. In both neurochemical classes basket cells predominate, but both groups included subpopulations of dendrite-targeting cells. Despite these similarities, the two populations exhibited very different somatic distributions, and each contained cellular morphologies not represented in the other.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Postnatal development of alkaline phosphatase activity correlates with the maturation of neurotransmission in the <BrainRegion>cerebral cortex</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>We have shown previously that the tissue nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP) is selectively expressed in the synaptic cleft of <BrainRegion>sensory cortical areas</BrainRegion> in adult mammals and, by using sensory deprivation, that TN alkaline phosphatase(AP) activity depends on thalamocortical activity. We further analyzed this structural functional relationship by comparing the developmental pattern of TN alkaline phosphatase(AP) activity to the maturation of the thalamocortical afferents in the primate brain (Callithrix jacchus). <BrainRegion>Cortical</BrainRegion> expression of alkaline phosphatase ( alkaline phosphatase(AP) ) activity reflects the sequential maturation of the modality-specific sensory areas. Within the <BrainRegion>visual cortex</BrainRegion>, the regional and laminar distribution of alkaline phosphatase(AP) correlates with the differential maturation of the magno- and parvocellular streams. alkaline phosphatase(AP) activity, which is transiently expressed in the white matter, exhibits a complementary distributional pattern with myelin staining. Ultrastructural analysis revealed that alkaline phosphatase(AP) activity is localized exclusively to the myelin-free axonal segments, including the node of Ranvier. It was also found that alkaline phosphatase(AP) activity is gradually expressed in parallel with the maturation of synaptic contacts in the neuropile. These data suggest the involvement of alkaline phosphatase(AP) , in addition to neurotransmitter synthesis previously suggested in the adult, in synaptic stabilization and in myelin pattern formation and put forward a role of alkaline phosphatase(AP) in <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> plasticity and brain disorders.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Response properties of nociceptive and low-threshold neurons in rat <BrainRegion>trigeminal pars caudalis</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>There is little doubt that <BrainRegion>trigeminal</BrainRegion> nociceptive neurons play a critical role in signaling the presence of harmful, or potentially harmful, orofacial stimuli. Unfortunately, there is only a limited understanding of how these neurons code such stimuli and whether this code is maintained in those structures responsible for generating overt reactions. The present series of experiments were designed to quantitatively document the response properties of nociceptive neurons in the rat <BrainRegion>trigeminal pars caudalis</BrainRegion> using the same electrical and innocuous and/or noxious mechanical and thermal stimuli employed in the characterization of nociceptive neurons with orofacial receptive fields in the rat <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion>. Neurons were classified as either low-threshold mechanoreceptive, wide-dynamic-range, or nociceptive-specific (type I, II) depending on their responsiveness to these stimuli. <BrainRegion>Nociceptive pars caudalis</BrainRegion> neurons (92/135, 68%) had receptive field organizations and input fibers (as indicated by latencies to electrical stimuli) quite different from those of low-threshold neurons (43/135, 32%). Nociceptive stimulus-response relationships for the population of wide-dynamic-range and nociceptive-specific type I neurons to contact heat stimuli were positively accelerating power functions with exponents of 3.9 and 4.4, respectively. This contrasted sharply with the low-threshold component of wide-dynamic-range neurons which was a negatively accelerating power function with an exponent of 0.7. All categories of nociceptive neurons also responded vigorously to cold stimuli. The thresholds of both hot and cold stimuli were often below psychophysical estimates of thermal pain, suggesting that &quot;nociceptive" neurons process far more information than that required to signal potentially harmful stimuli. The fundamental similarities in nociceptive properties in <BrainRegion>pars caudalis</BrainRegion> and other structures of the central nervous system suggest that there is little transformation of the information encoded at successive levels of the <BrainRegion>neuraxis</BrainRegion>. This is consistent with the idea that the functional role of nociceptive neurons is reflected more in which circuits they are integrated and less in differences in their physiological properties.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>A somatotopic and functional representation of the respiratory muscles in the <BrainRegion>trigeminal and facial motor nuclei</BrainRegion> of the carp (Cyprinus carpio L.).</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The place of the cells innervating six most important respiratory muscles in the carp (Cyprinus carpio L.) were determined by means of the horseradish peroxidase technique. It was found that these muscles are represented in the <BrainRegion>rostral and caudal subdivisions of the trigeminal and facial motor nuclei</BrainRegion>. All connections were ipsilateral. The distribution of the various cell populations over the different subnuclei has been related to the function of the respective muscles in the respiratory cycle. On these grounds it could be concluded that muscles active in the contraction phase of respiration are represented in the <BrainRegion>rostral subnuclei</BrainRegion>, the expansion muscles in the <BrainRegion>caudal subnuclei</BrainRegion>. This arrangement appears to be a compromise between a somatotopic and functional and functional organization.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<AbstractText>Application of horseradish peroxidase to lesions of the muscles and the central nervous system of larval zebrafish Brachydanio rerio was used to identify several types of neurons present in the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> was found to contain three distinct motoneuronal types: primary and secondary motoneurons that innervate the axial muscles, and pectoral fin motoneurons that innervate the muscles of the pectoral girdle. The cell types are similar to those described in larvae of other anamniote vertebrates. The axial muscles of a given hemisegment are innervated by two or three primary motoneurons and a larger number of secondary motoneurons in the corresponding <BrainRegion>spinal segment</BrainRegion>, whereas fin muscles are innervated by a pool of motoneurons spanning several <BrainRegion>spinal segments</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Cortical</BrainRegion> lesions induce an increase in cell number and PSA-NCAM expression in the <BrainRegion>subventricular zone</BrainRegion> of adult rats.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The <BrainRegion>subventricular zone</BrainRegion> (SVZ) bordering the lateral ventricle is one of the few regions of adult brain that contains dividing cells. These cells can differentiate into neurons in vivo after migration into the <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> and in vitro in the presence of appropriate growth factors. Little is known, however, about the fate of these cells in vivo after brain injury in adults. We examined cell number and expression of differentiation markers in the <BrainRegion>subventricular zone</BrainRegion>(SVZ) of adult rats after <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> lesions. Aspiration lesions of the <BrainRegion>sensorimotor cortex</BrainRegion> in adult rats induced a transient doubling of the number of cells in the <BrainRegion>subventricular zone</BrainRegion>(SVZ) at the level of the <BrainRegion>striatum</BrainRegion> without consistent increases in bromodeoxyuridine-labeled cells. Immunoreactivity to the polysialylated neural cell adhesion molecule, expressed by the majority of cells of the <BrainRegion>subventricular zone</BrainRegion>(SVZ) during development, increased dramatically after lesion. In contrast, immunolabeling for molecules found in mature neurons and glia did not increase in the <BrainRegion>subventricular zone</BrainRegion>(SVZ) after lesion, and immunoreactivity for growth factors that induce differentiation of <BrainRegion>subventricular zone</BrainRegion>(SVZ) cells in vitro decreased or remained undetectable, suggesting that lack of appropriate growth factor expression may contribute to the lack of differentiation of the newly accumulated cells in vivo. The data reveal that cells of the <BrainRegion>subventricular zone</BrainRegion>(SVZ) are capable of plasticity in the adult rat after brain injury in vivo and that the newly accumulated cells retain characteristics seen during development.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Long-range horizontal connections between supragranular pyramidal cells in the <BrainRegion>extrastriate visual cortex</BrainRegion> of the rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>In this study, we examined the morphological structure and synaptic physiology of long-range axon projections among supragranular pyramidal cells in the <BrainRegion>extrastriate visual cortex</BrainRegion> of the rat. Intra- and extracellular recordings from layer II/III pyramidal cells were performed in brain slices of <BrainRegion>area 18a</BrainRegion> following extracellular stimulation of either the underlying white matter or within layer II/III. Neurons were injected with biocytin for two-dimensional reconstruction of their axon arborizations. The conduction velocity of afferent fibers (0.58 m/s) was twice as high as that of intracortical tangential fibers (0.28 m/s). Layer II/III cells were mainly di- or polysynaptically driven by afferent activation, but predominantly monosynaptically driven from intracortical stimulation sites. The afferent as well as intracortically evoked postsynaptic potentials showed a very similar time course and shape. From both stimulation sites, suprathreshold action potentials could be elicited. The current threshold for a postsynaptic response and the slope and width of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) increased with the distance of lateral stimulation. The morphological properties of layer II/III pyramidal cell axon collaterals closely corresponded to the electrophysiological results. Long-range intraareal axon collaterals could be followed up to 1 mm within the supragranular layers. Their length-distance distribution showed an inverse relationship to the threshold currents of excitatory postsynaptic potentials(EPSPs) . Pyramidal cells exhibited regularly spaced patches of horizontal axon collaterals with an interpatch distance of about 250 microns. We concluded that the supragranular horizontal network in the <BrainRegion>extrastriate visual cortex</BrainRegion> of the rat is qualitatively very similar to that of cats and monkeys. However, quantitative differences exist in its spatial extent and physiological characteristics.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Morphology and distribution of microglial cells in the young and adult mouse <BrainRegion>cerebellum</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The morphology and distribution of microglial cells were studied in the normal <BrainRegion>cerebellum</BrainRegion> of young and adult mice using the histochemical demonstration of nucleoside diphosphatase as a specific microglial marker. Our results showed that microglial cells were present in all <BrainRegion>cerebellular lobules</BrainRegion> of both young and adult mice, but their distribution and morphology were not homogeneous throughout the <BrainRegion>cerebellum</BrainRegion>. Heterogeneity in microglial cell distribution was exclusively related to their location in the different histological layers, and no significant differences were found either between the different <BrainRegion>cerebellar lobules</BrainRegion> or between young and adult mice. Microglial density was higher in the <BrainRegion>cerebellar nuclei</BrainRegion> than in the <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion>; within the <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion>, the molecular layer was less densely populated by microglial cells than the granular layer and the white matter. The morphological study revealed that microglial cells were ramified in all <BrainRegion>cerebellar lobules</BrainRegion> of both young and adult mice but showed different sizes and ramification patterns as a function of their specific location in the different histological layers. Several typologies of microglial cells were described on the basis of observations in both horizontal and coronal sections. The specific layer-related pattern of microglial distribution and morphology in mouse <BrainRegion>cerebellum</BrainRegion> strongly suggests a physical and functional adaptation of these cells to the characteristics of their microenvironment.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Postnatal gliogenesis in the nerve fiber layer of the rabbit <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>: an autoradiographic study.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Cell proliferation was studied in the retina of rabbits at various postnatal stages. Autoradiography was performed with animals that received a single injection of 3H-thymidine and were sacrificed 1 hour later. This short survival time allowed the determination of the position of a cell undergoing DNA synthesis at that moment. Between birth and day 6, cells engaged in DNA synthesis were seen in the inner nuclear layer (INL) of the entire <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>. Cytogenesis ceases in this layer after the first postnatal week. Few labeled cells were detectable in the inner nuclear layer(INL) at day 9; these were found close to the <BrainRegion>ora serrata</BrainRegion>. Thus neurogenesis, which is known to occur in this layer of the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>, ceases by that time. In the nerve fiber layer (NFL), labeled cells were found at all ages between birth and day 27, which was the oldest stage examined in this study. By using horizontal sections through the nerve fiber layer(NFL) of entire <BrainRegion>retinae</BrainRegion>, it was observed that almost all labeled cells were confined to the medullary ray region, which is the neuroglia (astrocyte and oligodendrocyte)-bearing part of the nerve fiber layer(NFL) . Microglial cells, the only cellular elements present in the nerve fiber layer(NFL) outside the medullary ray region, were rarely labeled, and thus do not play a major role in gliogenesis occurring in the nerve fiber layer(NFL) . In addition to neuroglia, some endothelial cells were labeled after day 9. It is concluded that gliogenesis taking place in the nerve fiber layer(NFL) persists after the cessation of neurogenesis, suggesting that both processes occur independently.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Aberrant dendrite growth in central nervous system white matter induced by a mutant proteolipid protein transgene.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Transgenic mice were produced that carry a construct encoding a mutant form of the DM20 isoform of myelin proteolipid protein. The transgene is under the direction of the human Plp gene promoter, which has previously been shown to direct tissue-specific expression of transgenes. Two lines of mice were generated with this construct, both of which express the transgene at extremely low levels. Central nervous system myelination proceeds normally in the transgenic mice. However, in aged transgenic mice, areas of dendrite processes synapsed with axonal termini were observed within the white matter of the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>. This phenotype was accompanied by focal areas of astrocytic hypertrophy and an increase in apoptotic cell death in white matter but not gray matter. One interpretation of these findings is that expression of the mutant DM20 alters signaling between oligodendrocytes and neurons, producing abnormal neurite outgrowth.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>The <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion> balances sympathetic and parasympathetic output to peripheral organs through separate preautonomic neurons.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Opposing parasympathetic and sympathetic signals determine the autonomic output of the brain to the body and the change in balance over the sleep-wake cycle. The <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion> (SCN) organizes the activity/inactivity cycle and the behaviors that go along with it, but it is unclear how the <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion>, in particular the <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion>(SCN) , with its high daytime electrical activity, influences this differentiated autonomic balance. In a first series of experiments, we visualized hypothalamic pre-sympathetic neurons by injecting the retrograde tracer Fluoro-Gold into the <BrainRegion>thoracic sympathetic nuclei of the spinal cord</BrainRegion>. Pre-parasympathetic neurons were revealed by injection of the retrograde trans-synaptic tracer pseudorabies virus (PRV) into the liver and by sympathetic liver denervation, forcing the virus to infect via the vagus nerve only. This approach revealed separate pre-sympathetic and pre-parasympathetic neurons in the <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion>. Next, selective retrograde tracing with two unique reporter pseudorabies virus(PRV) strains, one injected into the <BrainRegion>adrenal</BrainRegion> and the other into the sympathetic denervated liver, demonstrated that there are two separate populations of pre-sympathetic and pre-parasympathetic neurons within the <BrainRegion>paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus</BrainRegion>. Interestingly, this segregation persists into the <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion>(SCN) , where, as a result, the day-night balance in autonomic function of the organs is affected by specialized <BrainRegion>pre-sympathetic or pre-parasympathetic suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion>(SCN) neurons. These separate <BrainRegion>preautonomic suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion>(SCN) neurons provide the anatomical basis for the circadian-driven regulation of the parasympathetic and sympathetic autonomic output.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Optic tectum</BrainRegion> of the eastern garter snake, Thamnophis sirtalis. IV. Morphology of afferents from the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The morphology of single <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> terminals in the <BrainRegion>optic tectum</BrainRegion> of the eastern garter snake was demonstrated by orthograde filling from extracellular injections of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) into the optic tract. horseradish peroxidase(HRP) -filled terminals share a characteristic shape and structure. Their parent axons course caudally in the <BrainRegion>stratum opticum</BrainRegion> within fascicles of 200-300 fibers of varying diameters. Single axons exit a fascicle and course into either the <BrainRegion>stratum fibrosum et griseum superficiale</BrainRegion>, ventrally, or the <BrainRegion>stratum zonale</BrainRegion>, dorsally, where they bifurcate successively two or three times into preterminal branches. Each preterminal branch gives rise to many thin, terminal branchlets laden with boutons. The arbors are ellipsoidal with their long axes oriented mediolaterally and their short axes oriented rostrocaudally. Arbors vary in their overall size (from 45 to 150 micron), in the diameters of their parent axons (from less than 0.5 to 3.0 micron), and in the size of their terminal boutons (from 0.5 to 3.5 micron). Bouton size increased with increasing diameter of the parent axon. The great majority of arbors are confined to one of three retinorecipient sublayers in the <BrainRegion>superficial tectum</BrainRegion>. However, the full range of arbor sizes and axon diameters is present in each sublayer.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>The morphology of local non-spiking interneurones in the metathoracic ganglion of the locust.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The morphology is described of a number of non-spiking interneurones in the metathoracic ganglion of the locust that control motor neurones innervating muscles in the coxa and femur of a hind leg. The non-spiking interneurones are penetrated with microelectrodes, physiologically characterized, injected with cobalt, and the stain subsequently intensified with silver. The interneurones have diverse shapes but all are local, intraganglionic interneurones. Their cell bodies are 10-20 micrometer in diameter and lie in either the ventral or dorsal layers of cell bodies that form a cortex around the ganglion. The branches of the interneurones are profuse and overlap those of the motor neurones that they affect. On interneurone may have branches in both the most ventral and the most dorsal areas of the neuropile. Most interneurones have branches only in one half of the ganglion, but one interneurone has extensive and asymmetrical regions of branches in both halves of the ganglion (fig. 4). Similar physiological effects can be mediated by interneurones with distinct morphologies. For example, the single slow extensor motor neurone is excited by six distinct morphological types of interneurones (figs. 10-13). It is suggested that as many as 65% of the neurones within a ganglion may be local interneurones, many of which in turn may be non-spiking.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Dopamine and nitric oxide control both flickering and steady-light-induced cone contraction and horizontal cell spinule formation in the teleost (carp) <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>: serial interaction of dopamine and nitric oxide.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Adaptation to ambient light, which is an important characteristic of the vertebrate visual system, involves cellular and subcellular (synaptic) plasticity of the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>. The present study investigated dopamine (DA) and nitric oxide (NO) as possible neurochemical modulators controlling cone photomechanical movements (PMMs) and horizontal cell (HC) spinules in relation to steady and flickering light adaptation in the carp retina. Haloperidol (HAL; a nonspecific dopamine(DA) receptor blocker) or cPTIO (a nitric oxide(NO) scavenger) largely inhibited the cone photomechanical movements(PMMs) and horizontal cell(HC) spinule formation induced by either steady or flickering light. These results suggested that both dopamine(DA) and nitric oxide(NO) could be involved in the light-adaptation changes induced by either pattern of input and that dopamine(DA) and nitric oxide(NO) effects may not be completely independent. The possibility that nitric oxide(NO) and dopamine(DA) interact serially was evaluated pharmacologically by cross-antagonist application (i.e., dopamine(DA) + cPTIO or nitric oxide(NO) + Haloperidol(HAL) ). When a nitric oxide(NO) donor was coapplied with Haloperidol(HAL) to dark-adapted eyecups, normal light-adaptive cone photomechanical movements(PMMs) and horizontal cell(HC) spinules occurred. In contrast, when dopamine(DA) was applied in the presence of cPTIO, the dark-adapted state persisted. It was concluded 1) that dopamine(DA) and nitric oxide(NO) are both light-adaptive neurochemicals, released in the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> during either steady or flickering light; 2) that the effects of dopamine(DA) and nitric oxide(NO) on light-adaptive cone photomechanical movements(PMMs) and horizontal cell(HC) spinules do not occur in parallel; and 3) that nitric oxide(NO) and dopamine(DA) act mainly in series, specifically as follows: Light --&amp;gt; dopamine(DA) --&gt; nitric oxide(NO) --&gt; Cone photomechanical movements(PMMs) + horizontal cell(HC) spinules.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Chemical phenotypes of muscle and cutaneous afferent neurons in the rat <BrainRegion>trigeminal</BrainRegion> ganglion.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Retrograde labeling was combined with cytochemistry to investigate phenotypic differences in primary afferent neurons relaying sensory information from deep and superficial craniofacial tissues. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), substance P (SP), somatostatin (SOM) immunoreactivity and isolectin IB4, and cholera toxin B (ChTB) binding were examined for <BrainRegion>trigeminal</BrainRegion> masticatory muscle and cutaneous afferent neurons. Somata labeled from muscle were larger than cutaneous afferent neurons. Muscle afferent neurons exhibited positive staining as follows: 22% Calcitonin gene-related peptide(CGRP) , 5% substance P(SP) , 0% somatostatin(SOM) ; 18% cholera toxin B(ChTB) , 5% IB4. The somata of Calcitonin gene-related peptide(CGRP) - and substance P(SP) -positive muscle afferent neurons were smaller than that of the overall muscle afferent population. Size differences were not detected between IB4- or cholera toxin B(ChTB) -binding muscle afferent neurons and the total muscle afferent population. The following distribution was found for cutaneous afferent neurons: 26% Calcitonin gene-related peptide(CGRP) , 7% substance P(SP) , 1% somatostatin(SOM) , 26% cholera toxin B(ChTB) , 44% IB4. Cutaneous afferent neurons positive for substance P(SP) were smaller, while cholera toxin B(ChTB) -binding cutaneous afferents were larger than the overall cutaneous afferent population. No size differences were found between cutaneous Calcitonin gene-related peptide(CGRP) -, somatostatin(SOM) -, or IB4-positive neurons and the total cutaneous afferent population. Target-specific differences exist for somatostatin(SOM) and IB4. The percentage of cutaneous afferent neurons positive for somatostatin(SOM) and IB4 exceeds that for somatostatin(SOM) - or IB4-positive muscle afferents. The number of retrogradely labeled neurons never differed between sexes. The percentage of retrogradely labeled muscle afferent neurons that were Calcitonin gene-related peptide(CGRP) -positive was greater in males than females. These data indicate the presence of phenotypic, target, and sex differences in trigeminal ganglion primary afferent neurons.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Dorsal striatopallidal system in anurans.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The dorsal striatopallidal system of tetrapods consists of the <BrainRegion>dorsal striatum</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>caudate-putamen</BrainRegion> in mammals) and the <BrainRegion>dorsal pallidum</BrainRegion>. Although the existence of <BrainRegion>striatal</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>pallidal structures</BrainRegion> has been well documented in anuran amphibians, the exact boundaries of these structures have so far been a matter of debate. To delineate precisely the dorsal striatopallidal system of anurans, we used quantitative analysis of leucine-enkephalin immunohistochemistry (in Bombina orientalis, Discoglossus pictus, Xenopus laevis, and Hyla versicolor), retrograde neurobiotin tracing studies (injections in the central and ventromedial thalamic nuclei in H. versicolor), and double-labeling tracing studies (injections in the lateral forebrain bundle and the caudal striatum in B. orientalis). Immunohistochemistry revealed that enkephalin-positive neurons are located mainly in the <BrainRegion>rostral and intermediate striatum</BrainRegion>. Neurobiotin tracing studies demonstrated that neurons projecting to the <BrainRegion>central and ventromedial thalamic nuclei</BrainRegion> are found in the <BrainRegion>intermediate and caudal striatum</BrainRegion>. Double-labeling studies revealed that the population of neurons in the <BrainRegion>rostral and intermediate striatum</BrainRegion> innervating the <BrainRegion>caudal striatum</BrainRegion> is separated from neurons projecting into the <BrainRegion>lateral forebrain bundle</BrainRegion>. Neurons that project to both the <BrainRegion>caudal striatum</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>lateral forebrain bundle</BrainRegion> are found only in the <BrainRegion>dorsal part of the intermediate striatum</BrainRegion>. Taken together, our results suggest that the <BrainRegion>rostral striatum</BrainRegion> of anurans is homologous to the <BrainRegion>striatum proper</BrainRegion> of mammals, whereas the <BrainRegion>caudal striatum</BrainRegion> is comparable to the <BrainRegion>dorsal pallidum</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>intermediate striatum</BrainRegion> represents a transition area between the two structures.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>The developmental morphology of Torpedo marmorata: electric lobe-electromotoneuron proliferation and cell death.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Electromotoneuron proliferation and cell death have been quantitatively studied in the electric lobe of Torpedo marmorata from an embryonic body-length stage of 26-mm to adult animals. These neurons project to the electric organ and form synapses with electrocytes which possess a remarkably large postsynaptic target surface. For this reason cell death would not be predicted to occur if synaptic competition were to be hypothesized as the cause. Isolated observations at the ultrastructural level suggested, however, that cell death was indeed taking place and therefore it seemed appropriate to examine this question in detail. Our findings show first that neuron production appears to be a continuous process throughout the period studied, generating totals of over 70,000 electromotoneurons per lobe by adulthood. Second, two waves of cell death were identified, one occurring early in embryogenesis (stage 30 mm), well before the onset of synaptogenesis, and a second coincident with the onset of synaptogenesis (stages 55--74 mm). It is difficult to reconcile this latter wave with the hypothesis of synaptic competition as the postsynaptic surface at this time of development is largely devoid of synaptic contacts. We conclude that in the electromotor system of Torpedo, synaptic competition is probably not the mechanism of cell death.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Predominance of corticothalamic synaptic inputs to <BrainRegion>thalamic reticular nucleus</BrainRegion> neurons in the rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Quantitative electron microscopy was used to examine the relative contributions of different types of synapses to the circuitry of the <BrainRegion>thalamic reticular nucleus</BrainRegion> (RTN) in the rat. Single <BrainRegion>reticular nucleus</BrainRegion>(RTN) cells were injected with Lucifer Yellow (LY) in fixed brain slices and examined after photoconversion; corticothalamic axons and terminals were labeled by anterograde transport of Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin (PHA-L); and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic terminals were labeled by postembedding immunocytochemistry. Three types of synapses, made by morphologically distinguishable small terminals (ST), large terminals (LT), and gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) ergic terminals, were distributed on all portions of the dendritic trees of injected <BrainRegion>reticular nucleus</BrainRegion>(RTN) cells. small terminals(ST) and large terminals(LT) terminals formed asymmetrical, presumed excitatory, synaptic contacts. On proximal dendrites, approximately 50% of the synapses were small terminals(ST) , 30-40% were large terminals(LT) , and 10-25% were gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) ergic. On distal dendrites, 60-65% were small terminals(ST) , 20% were large terminals(LT) , and 15% were gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) ergic. Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin(PHA-L) labeling showed that labeled corticothalamic terminals and small terminals(ST) terminals have identical morphological features and the same distribution patterns on <BrainRegion>reticular nucleus</BrainRegion>(RTN) dendrites, indicating that the majority of excitatory afferents to <BrainRegion>reticular nucleus</BrainRegion>(RTN) neurons are derived from the <BrainRegion>cerebral cortex</BrainRegion>. The large terminals(LT) terminals found in smaller numbers are probably derived from collateral axons of thalamocortical relay cells. gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) ergic terminals formed by Lucifer Yellow(LY) -labeled, <BrainRegion>intra- reticular nucleus</BrainRegion>(RTN) axon collaterals were relatively few in number, and no dendrodendritic synapses were observed.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Chemotopic odorant coding in a mammalian olfactory system.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Systematic mapping studies involving 365 odorant chemicals have shown that glomerular responses in the rat <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> are organized spatially in patterns that are related to the chemistry of the odorant stimuli. This organization involves the spatial clustering of principal responses to numerous odorants that share key aspects of chemistry such as functional groups, hydrocarbon structural elements, and/or overall molecular properties related to water solubility. In several of the clusters, responses shift progressively in position according to odorant carbon chain length. These response domains appear to be constructed from orderly projections of sensory neurons in the <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> epithelium and may also involve chromatography across the nasal mucosa. The spatial clustering of glomerular responses may serve to &quot;tune" the principal responses of bulbar projection neurons by way of inhibitory interneuronal networks, allowing the projection neurons to respond to a narrower range of stimuli than their associated sensory neurons. When glomerular activity patterns are viewed relative to the overall level of glomerular activation, the patterns accurately predict the perception of odor quality, thereby supporting the notion that spatial patterns of activity are the key factors underlying that aspect of the olfactory code. A critical analysis suggests that alternative coding mechanisms for odor quality, such as those based on temporal patterns of responses, enjoy little experimental support. J. Comp.

<ArticleTitle>Neonatal enucleation induces correlated modification in sensory responsive areas and pial angioarchitecture of the <BrainRegion>parietal and occipital cortex</BrainRegion> of albino rats.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>This study was carried out to investigate whether correlations existing in normal adult rats (Ambach et al., &apos;86) between functional characteristics of <BrainRegion>neocortical areas</BrainRegion> and their pial angioarchitecture can be correspondingly modified under pathological conditions. The right eyes of albino rats were enucleated on the 1st, 8th, 15th and 30th day after birth, respectively. At the age of 3 to 4 months, the responsiveness of the <BrainRegion>parieto-occipital cortex</BrainRegion> to sensory stimuli was studied in enucleated animals and age matched controls. After the mapping of visually and somatosensorily evoked potentials, the vascular system was filled with dye. Monocular enucleation at birth induced bilateral modifications in sensory responsiveness and corresponding changes in pial angioarchitecture, especially in the venous drainage fields. In comparison with the controls, a considerable expansion was observed in the overlapping zone between visually and somatosensorily responsive areas. In contrast, borders of the <BrainRegion>visual cortex</BrainRegion> toward the <BrainRegion>auditory and retrosplenial areas</BrainRegion> were essentially stable. Corresponding changes were found in the pial distribution patterns of cerebral veins but not of arteries. The major effect of neonatal enucleation on angioarchitecture was a change in the subdivision of the parieto-occipital veins drainage fields. This was due to a significant enlargement of the anterior accessory occipital (O3) vein, which compressed the drainage fields of the parietal and occipital veins and completely separated them from one another. The results suggest that during ontogenesis: (1) alterations in the formation of sensory input may interfere with neocortical angiogenesis, especially the structuring of veins, (2) after monocular enucleation this influence is prominent in parietal and occipital cerebral veins, and (3) these angiogenetic processes are vulnerable only during the perinatal and early postnatal period.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Structural features of mossy cells in the hamster <BrainRegion>dentate gyrus</BrainRegion>, with special reference to somatic thorny excrescences.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>We have recently revealed that large multipolar neurons, presumed mossy cells in the hamster <BrainRegion>dentate gyrus</BrainRegion> (DG), were calretinin (CR)-immunoreactive (IR) at the ventral level, although these neurons were calretinin(CR) -negative at the dorsal level. In the present study, we confirmed this identification with several methods and analyzed structural features of hamster mossy cells in detail. Golgi impregnationi and intracellular Lucifer yellow labeling studies revealed that mossy cells in the hamster <BrainRegion>dentate hilus</BrainRegion> had extraordinarily prominent thorny excrescences on their somata as well as on their proximal dendrites. Mossy cells exhibited dorsoventral differences in their structural features; proximal dendrites of single mossy cells were fewer, and thorny excrescences were larger and more complicated at the dorsal level than at the ventral level. Electron microscopic serial section three-dimensional reconstructions revealed that somatic thorny excrescences consisted of large and complicated spines, which received numerous asymmetrical synapses from mossy fiber terminals. In addition, our confocal laser scanning microscopic observations also revealed many glutamic acid decarboxylase-immunoreactive punctae abutting the mossy cell somata and dendrites. Our present and previous observations revealed the structural features of hamster mossy cells and their differences along the dorsoventral axis and further indicated that mossy cells were prominently different in their chemical and morphological features among species.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>An investigation of cholinergic circuitry in cat <BrainRegion>striate cortex</BrainRegion> using acetylcholinesterase histochemistry.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The organization of cholinergic inputs to cat <BrainRegion>striate cortex</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>area 17</BrainRegion>) was studied by using a histochemical stain for acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Axons were labelled in all layers of the <BrainRegion>striate cortex</BrainRegion>, with distinct plexuses occurring in layer I, lower layer III, layer IVc, and layer VI. In addition to the stained axons, a population of layer V pyramidal cells was intensely acetylcholinesterase(AChE) -positive. Surgical undercutting eliminated virtually all of the acetylcholinesterase(AChE) -positive axons in the <BrainRegion>striate cortex</BrainRegion>, thus indicating that this innervation arises entirely from an extrinsic source in the cat. To identify this source, cell groups projecting to <BrainRegion>area 17</BrainRegion> were retrogradely labelled with horseradish peroxidase. Cell groups labelled with horseradish peroxidase that were also intensely acetylcholinesterase(AChE) -positive were considered as possible candidates for providing the cholinergic input to the <BrainRegion>striate cortex</BrainRegion>. These included the <BrainRegion>basal forebrain</BrainRegion>, several <BrainRegion>intralaminar nuclei</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>. Kainate lesions were then made in each of these structures to assess their individual contributions to the <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> acetylcholinesterase(AChE) pattern. <BrainRegion>Cortical</BrainRegion> acetylcholinesterase(AChE) was depleted only after lesions of the <BrainRegion>basal forebrain</BrainRegion>, suggesting that this is the sole source of acetylcholinesterase(AChE) -positive axons in <BrainRegion>area 17</BrainRegion>. Because the <BrainRegion>cortically</BrainRegion> projecting cells in this region have been shown to contain choline acetyltransferase in a number of species, we postulate that the acetylcholinesterase(AChE) -positive fibers we describe in the cat <BrainRegion>striate cortex</BrainRegion> are in fact cholinergic.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Postnatal development of cat hind limb motoneurons. III: Changes in size of motoneurons supplying the triceps surae muscle.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The postnatal changes of neuronal dimensions were studied in cat triceps surae motoneurons intracellularly labeled with horseradish peroxidase. Systematic correlations were observed in the analysis of single dendrites at each studied stage, from birth to 44-46 days post natum (d.p.n.) age, between size parameters intrinsic to the dendrites as the diameter of a 1st-order dendrite, the combined dendritic length, the dendritic membrane area, and the degree of branching. Some variability among samples was evident in each studied age group. The correlations were, however, sufficiently close to permit indirect estimations of both combined dendritic length and dendritic membrane area for larger samples of neurons from data on dendritic stem caliber. The total postnatal increase in dendritic membrane area was, on the average, 400%, i.e., from close to 100 X 10(3) microns2 to about 500 X 10(3) microns2. The corresponding increase in soma area amounted to 100%. Analysis revealed that there was a time lag between the increase in somatic and dendritic size. Thus, adult somatic dimensions were attained at age 44-46 days post natum(d.p.n.) ; however, at this stage, the mean total dendritic membrane area was only about half of the adult value. The postnatal increase in size appeared to vary among neurons, yielding a wider neuronal size spectrum in the adult cat than that observed in kittens. The measured increase in size corresponded to a calculated average addition of dendritic membrane area of 3700 microns2/day from birth to 22-24 days post natum(d.p.n.) and from that stage to 44-46 days post natum(d.p.n.) of 2700 microns2 per day. Likewise, the increase in combined dendritic length could initially be as large as 1 mm/day down to 0.4 mm/day between 22-24 and 44-46 days post natum(d.p.n.) , with a mean growth during the first 44-46 days post natum(d.p.n.) of 0.5 to 0.6 mm/day. The ratios of daughters to parent branch diameters (sigmadd1.5: dp1.5) and the dendritic trunk parameter (sigma d1.5) recorded along the proximodistal dendritic path distance revealed transient changes that might impact on the electrotonic properties of the dendrites during postnatal development. Computations from the measured changes in dendritic branch lengths and calibers indicated that if membrane and internal resistivity remain unaltered during postnatal development, the dendritic domain is electrotonically more compact in the newborn kitten than in the adult cat.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Central projections of vestibular afferents from the <BrainRegion>horizontal semicircular canal</BrainRegion> in the carpet shark Cephaloscyllium isabella.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>This study utilizes anterograde axonal transport of cobaltous-lysine and conventional silver-staining techniques to study the central projections of the <BrainRegion>horizontal semicircular canal branch of the VIII nerve</BrainRegion> within the <BrainRegion>vestibular nuclei</BrainRegion> of the carpet shark Cephaloscyllium isabella. Two major terminating axon fields were observed, one caudal and one rostral to the entrance of the <BrainRegion>VIII nerve</BrainRegion>, corresponding to the <BrainRegion>ventral vestibular nucleus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>superior vestibular nucleus</BrainRegion>, respectively. Both fields appear to be located within the ventral portion of the nuclei indicating an apparent subdivision of the <BrainRegion>VIII nerve</BrainRegion> projections within the <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion>. The resolution of the sensitive cobalt tracer indicates the presence of both dendritic and pericellular termination of these primary afferent fibres. In the area immediately <BrainRegion>caudal to the entrance of the VIII nerve</BrainRegion> a number of labelled primary afferent fibres project to the <BrainRegion>ventral region of the intermediate nucleus</BrainRegion>. Other fibres follow the <BrainRegion>visceral sensory root VII</BrainRegion> and terminate <BrainRegion>proximal to the sulcus limitans</BrainRegion> of His within the dendritic field of the neurons of the <BrainRegion>nucleus magnocellularis</BrainRegion>. Some fibres turn ventromedially from the main group of the ascending fibres and terminate in the area of the <BrainRegion>inferior reticular formation</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Cross-species septohippocampal transplants: ultrastructure of Thy-1.2-labeled donor fibers into the <BrainRegion>dentate gyrus</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>A naturally occurring species-specific membrane marker was used to identify unambiguously transplanted <BrainRegion>septal</BrainRegion> cells and their fibers which have grown into host tissue. Cell suspensions of the <BrainRegion>septum/basal forebrain region</BrainRegion> of C57Bl/6 mouse embryos were transplanted into the <BrainRegion>dentate gyrus</BrainRegion> of Sprague-Dawley rats that had received a <BrainRegion>fornix</BrainRegion> lesion. The membranes of the mouse contained Thy-1.2, while the membranes of the rat contained Thy-1.1. An antibody to Thy-1.2 clearly identified the donor tissue and did not react with the Thy-1.1 of the host&apos;s membranes. The ultrastructure of the immunoreactively labeled tissue confirmed previous biochemical findings on the distribution of Thy-1 and showed Thy-1.2 immunoreactivity on axons and dendrites, microtubules, some mitochondrial membranes, and the surface membranes of cell bodies. Within the transplant, a few glial profiles showed immunoreactive fibrils, but most glial profiles within the transplant and all glial profiles outside the transplant were not immunoreactive. Astrocyte fibers enclosed the outgrowing labeled fibers to form fascicles, but did not penetrate the fascicle. There was no other distinctive association of astrocytic profiles with immunoreactive fibers. Dendrites grew for long distances into the host's molecular layer. Many immunoreactive dendritic profiles formed synapses with unlabeled terminal profiles from the host. The host synapses on the long dendrites of the transplanted neurons may form an important source of input for the initiation of physiological activity in the new circuits established by the transplant. A few labeled (donor) synaptic terminals were observed in the molecular layer, but Thy-1.2-labeled dendritic profiles were much more prominent than labeled axonal profiles.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Callosal</BrainRegion> connections correlate preferentially with <BrainRegion>ipsilateral cortical domains</BrainRegion> in cat <BrainRegion>areas 17 and 18</BrainRegion>, and with contralateral domains in the <BrainRegion>17/18 transition zone</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Previous studies have shown that the distribution of <BrainRegion>callosal</BrainRegion> connections in the <BrainRegion>17/18 callosal zone</BrainRegion> of the cat is patchy at a small scale, but the mechanisms that determine this periodic pattern remain unclear. The present study investigated this issue by correlating the distribution of retrogradely labeled <BrainRegion>callosal</BrainRegion> cells with the underlying patterns of <BrainRegion>ocular dominance columns</BrainRegion> (ODCs) revealed transneuronally after intraocular injections of wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase. The density of labeled <BrainRegion>callosal</BrainRegion> cells was found to vary significantly between adjacent territories dominated by different eyes, indicating that the distribution of <BrainRegion>callosal</BrainRegion> cells is significantly biased toward domains that are eye specific. Moreover, <BrainRegion>callosal</BrainRegion> connections relate to the pattern of <BrainRegion>ocular dominance columns</BrainRegion>(ODCs) in a rather unique way: <BrainRegion>callosal</BrainRegion> cells correlate preferentially with <BrainRegion>contralateral ocular dominance columns(ODCs) within the 17/18 transition zone</BrainRegion> (TZ), and with <BrainRegion>ipsilateral ocular dominance columns(ODCs) in regions of areas 17 and 18</BrainRegion> located outside the <BrainRegion>transition zone</BrainRegion>(TZ) . Similar results were obtained in cats raised with strabismus, indicating that the overlap between <BrainRegion>right and left ocular dominance columns</BrainRegion>(ODCs) present in normal cats does not influence the correlation between <BrainRegion>callosal</BrainRegion> neurons and <BrainRegion>ocular dominance columns</BrainRegion>(ODCs) . The results are consistent with the hypothesis that <BrainRegion>callosal</BrainRegion> linkages are stabilized during development by interhemispheric correlated activity driven by bilateral projections from <BrainRegion>temporal retina</BrainRegion>. It is proposed that developmental constraints imposed by both this <BrainRegion>retinally</BrainRegion> driven mechanism and the pattern of <BrainRegion>ocular dominance columns</BrainRegion>(ODCs) are likely to determine not only the association of <BrainRegion>callosal</BrainRegion> clusters with specific sets of <BrainRegion>ocular dominance columns</BrainRegion>(ODCs) , but also important aspects of the functional characteristics of the <BrainRegion>callosal</BrainRegion> pathway in cat <BrainRegion>striate cortex</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Evidence for coexistence of enkephalin and glutamate in axon terminals and cellular sites for functional interactions of their receptors in the rat <BrainRegion>locus coeruleus</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The authors previously showed that a subset of axon terminals in the <BrainRegion>locus coeruleus</BrainRegion> (LC) contains methionine5-enkephalin (ENK) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) immunoreactivities. However, numerous methionine5-enkephalin(ENK) -labeled terminals lacked gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) and exhibited synaptic specializations that were characteristic of excitatory-type transmitters. To determine whether methionine5-enkephalin(ENK) coexists with glutamate in the <BrainRegion>locus coeruleus</BrainRegion>(LC) , preembedding immunoperoxidase detection of methionine5-enkephalin(ENK) or immunogold-silver was combined with postembedding identification of glutamate using a gold marker. Indeed, 28% of the methionine5-enkephalin(ENK) -labeled axon terminals examined (n = 250 axon terminals) also contained glutamate. To define further sites for functional interactions between opiate ligands and excitatory amino acid receptors, the ultrastructural localization of the mu-opioid receptor (MOR) was examined with respect to either the kainate receptor (KAR) or the R1 subunit of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NR1)-type glutamate receptor in the <BrainRegion>locus coeruleus</BrainRegion>(LC) . Gold-silver labeling for mu-opioid receptor(MOR) and peroxidase labeling for either kainate receptor(KAR) or NR1 indicated that the mu-opioid receptor(MOR) often was localized to the plasma membrane of dendrites that also exhibited immunolabeling for either glutamate receptor subtype. In contrast to the kainate receptor(KAR) , which was identified primarily in somata and dendrites, NR1 immunoreactivity also was found frequently in axon terminals as well as in glial processes. Glial processes containing NR1 occasionally exhibited immunolabeling for mu-opioid receptor(MOR) and sometimes were directly apposed to mu-opioid receptor(MOR) -containing dendrites in the locus coeruleus(LC) . Furthermore, NR1-labeled receptors in axon terminals sometimes were presynaptic to mu-opioid receptor(MOR) -labeled dendrites. The authors concluded that methionine5-enkephalin(ENK) and glutamate may be cotransmitters in <BrainRegion>locus coeruleus</BrainRegion>(LC) afferents. Moreover, ligands at the kainate receptor(KAR) may modulate directly mu-opioid receptor(MOR) -containing neurons in the <BrainRegion>locus coeruleus</BrainRegion>(LC) , whereas actions at NR1 receptors may affect opioid-sensitive neurons through multiple cellular mechanisms, i.e., through presynaptic, postsynaptic, or glial actions.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Synaptic protein expression by regenerating adult photoreceptors.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Regeneration of functionally normal synapses is required for functional recovery after degenerative central nervous system insults and requires proper expression and targeting of presynaptic proteins by regenerating neurons. The reconstitution of presynaptic terminals by regenerating adult neurons is poorly understood, however. We examined the intrinsic ability of regenerating adult <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> photoreceptors to reconstitute properly differentiated presynaptic terminals in the absence of target contact. The expression and localization of vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP), synaptic vesicle protein 2 (SV2), synaptophysin, synapsin I, and synaptosomal-associated protein of 25 kDa (SNAP-25) was assessed immunocytochemically. Photoreceptor terminals in the intact <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> contain vesicle-associated membrane protein(VAMP) , synaptic vesicle protein 2(SV2) , synaptophysin, and synaptosomal-associated protein of 25 kDa(SNAP-25) , but not synapsin I. Isolated, regenerating adult photoreceptors intrinsically expressed the proper complement of synaptic vesicle proteins in the absence of target contact: vesicle-associated membrane protein(VAMP) , synaptic vesicle protein 2(SV2) , and synaptophysin were present at all stages of regenerative growth; synapsin I was never expressed. At early stages of regenerative growth, vesicle-associated membrane protein(VAMP) , synaptic vesicle protein 2(SV2) , and synaptophysin were diffusely localized in the cell, with prominent vesicle-associated membrane protein(VAMP) labeling distributed along the plasma membrane. synaptic vesicle protein 2(SV2) and synaptophysin rapidly localized to regenerated terminals, but vesicle-associated membrane protein(VAMP) accumulated much more slowly, indicating that these proteins are trafficked independently. In contrast, labeling for synaptosomal-associated protein of 25 kDa(SNAP-25) , which is associated with the presynaptic plasma membrane, was undetectable in regenerating photoreceptors, suggesting that synaptosomal-associated protein of 25 kDa(SNAP-25) expression is target-regulated. Thus, regenerating photoreceptors can intrinsically regulate the expression of the proper set of synaptic vesicle proteins. Proper expression of other presynaptic proteins, such as synaptosomal-associated protein of 25 kDa(SNAP-25) , and proper subcellular localization of synaptic proteins such as vesicle-associated membrane protein(VAMP) , however, may require extrinsic cues such as target contact.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Estrogens modulate experimentally induced apoptosis of granule cells in the adult <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Estrogens are known to have broad effects on neuronal plasticity, but their specific role in neuronal cell death has not been determined. In the present study, we investigated the effects of beta-estradiol on an experimental model of apoptosis of granule cells of the <BrainRegion>dentate gyrus</BrainRegion>, i.e., apoptosis induced by intraventricular injection of the microtubule polymerization inhibitor colchicine. Cell death was characterized with multiple methods, including TUNEL and DNA electrophoresis. Nonrandom digestion of DNA was observed within 8-10 hours after colchicine injection, followed by condensation and fragmentation of granule cell nuclei and extensive anterograde degeneration of mossy fibers/terminals in 2 days. We compared the outcomes of the above-described manipulation in ovariectomized or sham-operated rats and animals treated daily with beta-estradiol or vehicle. Animals were lesioned with colchicine or vehicle 2 weeks after ovariectomy or sham operation. Beta-estradiol or vehicle was administered for 1 week prior to lesion and was continued for a further 2 weeks. Total numbers and densities of granule cells in different animal groups were counted by stereology in various <BrainRegion>anteroposterior levels of the hippocampus</BrainRegion>. Our results show that ovariectomy intensifies colchicine-induced granule cell apoptosis, which is ameliorated by exogenous beta-estradiol. In doses that ameliorate the adverse effect of ovariectomy, exogenous beta-estradiol appears to have no effect of preventing granule cell death in animals with intact ovaries; i.e., an estrogen excess is not more neuroprotective than physiological levels of these hormones. Taken together, our results indicate that estrogen deprivation increases the vulnerability of hippocampal neurons to injury and may predispose to neurological diseases occurring after menopause.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Distribution and morphology of synapses on nonspiking local interneurones in the thoracic nervous system of the locust.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The structure and distribution of synapses on nonspiking local interneurones in the metathoracic ganglion of the locust was revealed by electron microscopy following intracellular injection of horseradish peroxidase (HRP). Before staining, each interneurone was characterized physiologically as nonspiking and its output effects on motor neurones innervating muscles in a hindleg were investigated. Three nonspiking interneurones of different morphologies, each typical of a previously described population, were selected for detailed study. The first has a dorsal soma and ipsilateral neuropilar branches, the second a ventral soma and ipsilateral branches, and the third a ventral soma and contralateral branches. The somata have few trophospongial invaginations, and most of their volume is occupied by the nucleus. The initial parts of the primary neurites are either wrapped in glia or isolated in tracts from the neuropile and thus do not participate in synaptic interactions. Some of the larger secondary neurites are also wrapped in glia, but others both make and receive synaptic contacts. Output synapses have an array of some 500-1,600 round, agranular vesicles (diameter 47.0 +/- 5.7 nm; mean +/- S.D., n = 97) associated with a bar-shaped presynaptic density up to 0.3 micron long. Two postsynaptic processes, whose diameter can vary greatly, are usually associated with each presynaptic density. Processes making input synapses onto nonspiking local interneurones typically contain round, agranular vesicles and often make several contacts within a few microns. Serial reconstructions from one of the interneurones revealed input and output synapses intermingled on the larger processes with outputs dominating by a factor of 3:1, whereas on some of the thinner processes only input synapses are present. In the other two interneurones, however, both input and output synapses are present on the fine branches. No feature of the structure or distribution of synapses observed here on the nonspiking local interneurones distinguishes them from spiking neurones in the same ganglia.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Thalamocortical synapses of pyramidal cells which project from <BrainRegion>SmI</BrainRegion> to <BrainRegion>MsI cortex</BrainRegion> in the mouse.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Electrolytic lesions were made of the <BrainRegion>nucleus ventralis posterior pars lateralis thalami</BrainRegion> and of the <BrainRegion>nucleus posterior thalami</BrainRegion> in the male CD/1 mice to label thalamocortical axon terminals in mouse <BrainRegion>SmI cortex</BrainRegion>. Pyramidal cells in layers II through V of <BrainRegion>SmI cortex</BrainRegion> were labeled by the retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase injected into <BrainRegion>ipsilateral MsI</BrainRegion>. Numerous pyramidal cells, particularly in the more superficial layers of <BrainRegion>SmI cortex</BrainRegion>, were filled with reaction product so that even their dendritic spines and local axon collaterals were clearly visible. Six well-filled pyramidal cells with somata in layers III and IV were serial thin-sectioned, and portions of their dendrites in layer IV were examined with the electron microscope to determine the distribution of their thalamocortical and other synapses. It was found that, in general, different dendrites of a single pyramidal cell formed similar proportions of thalamocortical synapses and that the six pyramidal cells, as a group, also formed similar proportions of thalamocortical synapses with their dendrites in layer IV. In contrast, when the thalamocortical connectivity of the six cells was considered as a function of their depths within the <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion>, a clear trend was seen for the proportion of thalamocortical synapses to increase with increasing proximity of the cell body to layer IV. A hypothesis based on the timing of developmental events is proposed to account for this observation.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Localization of kynurenine aminotransferase immunoreactivity in the rat <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The localization and distribution of kynurenine aminotransferase (KAT), the biosynthetic enzyme of the excitatory amino acid receptor antagonist, kynurenic acid, was studied in the rat <BrainRegion>hippocampal formation</BrainRegion> with immunohistochemical methods. The enzyme was found mainly in glial cells that could be distinguished as 3 types on the basis of their shapes and locations. Typically, these cells shared the morphological features of astrocytes and exhibited glial fibrillary acidic protein immunoreactivity as demonstrated by a double-labeling technique. The distribution of kynurenine aminotransferase(KAT) -containing glial cells was heterogeneous throughout the <BrainRegion>hippocampal formation</BrainRegion>. In the <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>stratum lacunosum-moleculare of Ammon&apos;s horn and the hilus</BrainRegion> contained a higher density of kynurenine aminotransferase(KAT) -positive glial cells than other regions, whereas the lowest density of kynurenine aminotransferase(KAT) glial cells was observed in the granule cell layer of the <BrainRegion>dentate gyrus</BrainRegion> and in the <BrainRegion>stratum radiatum of CA subfields</BrainRegion>. In the <BrainRegion>subicular complex</BrainRegion>, the density of kynurenine aminotransferase(KAT) -containing glial cells was generally higher in the superficial than in the deep layer. <BrainRegion>Hippocampal</BrainRegion> neurons exhibiting kynurenine aminotransferase(KAT) immunoreactivity, distinguished as nonpyramidal cells, were very few in number and mainly distributed in <BrainRegion>strata oriens and pyramidale of Ammon&apos;s horn</BrainRegion>. Substantially more kynurenine aminotransferase(KAT) -positive neurons were observed in layers II and III of the subicular complex. The organization of cellular elements containing kynurenine aminotransferase(KAT) may be of relevance for the function and possible dysfunction of kynurenic acid in the rat <BrainRegion>hippocampal formation</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Thalamic</BrainRegion> connectivity of the <BrainRegion>second somatosensory area</BrainRegion> and neighboring somatosensory fields of the <BrainRegion>lateral sulcus</BrainRegion> of the macaque.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The thalamocortical relations of the somatic fields in and around the <BrainRegion>lateral sulcus</BrainRegion> of the macaque were studied following <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> injections of tritated amino acids and horseradish peroxidase (HRP). Special attention was paid to the <BrainRegion>second somatosensory area</BrainRegion> (S2), the connections of which were also studied by means of <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> isotope injections and retrograde degeneration. <BrainRegion>S2</BrainRegion> was shown to receive its major <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> input from the <BrainRegion>ventroposterior inferior thalamic nucleus</BrainRegion> (VPI) and not, as previously reported, from the <BrainRegion>caudal division of the ventroposterior lateral nucleus</BrainRegion> (VPLc). Following small injections of isotope or horseradish peroxidase(HRP) into the hand representation of <BrainRegion>S2</BrainRegion>, only <BrainRegion>ventroposterior inferior thalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>(VPI) was labeled. Larger injections, which included the representations of more body parts, led to heavy label in <BrainRegion>ventroposterior inferior thalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>(VPI) , with scattered label in <BrainRegion>ventroposterior lateral nucleus</BrainRegion>(VPLc) , the <BrainRegion>central lateral nucleus</BrainRegion> (CL), and the <BrainRegion>posterior nucleus</BrainRegion> (Po). In addition, small isotope injections into <BrainRegion>ventroposterior lateral nucleus</BrainRegion>(VPLc) did not result in label in <BrainRegion>S2</BrainRegion> unless <BrainRegion>ventroposterior inferior thalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>(VPI) was also involved in the injection site, and ablations of <BrainRegion>S2</BrainRegion> led to cell loss in <BrainRegion>ventroposterior inferior thalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>(VPI) . Comparison of injections involving different body parts in <BrainRegion>S2</BrainRegion> suggested a somatotopic arrangement within <BrainRegion>ventroposterior inferior thalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>(VPI) such that the trunk and lower limb representations are located posterolaterally and the hand and arm representations anteromedially. The location of the <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> representations of the head, face, and intraoral structures that project to <BrainRegion>S2</BrainRegion> may be in the <BrainRegion>ventroposterior medial nucleus</BrainRegion> (VPM). The <BrainRegion>granular (Ig) and dysgranular (Id) fields of the insula</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>retroinsular field</BrainRegion> (Ri) each receive inputs from a variety of nuclei located at the <BrainRegion>posteroventral border of the thalamus</BrainRegion>. <BrainRegion>Ig</BrainRegion> receives its heaviest input from the <BrainRegion>suprageniculate-limitans complex</BrainRegion> (SG-Li), with additional inputs from <BrainRegion>posterior nucleus</BrainRegion>(Po) , the <BrainRegion>magnocellular division of the medial geniculate n</BrainRegion>. (MGmc), <BrainRegion>ventroposterior inferior thalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>(VPI) , and the <BrainRegion>medial pulvinar</BrainRegion> (Pulm). <BrainRegion>Id</BrainRegion> receives its heaviest input from the <BrainRegion>basal ventromedial n</BrainRegion>. (VMb), with additional inputs from <BrainRegion>ventroposterior inferior thalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>(VPI) , <BrainRegion>posterior nucleus</BrainRegion>(Po) , <BrainRegion>suprageniculate-limitans complex</BrainRegion>(SG-Li) , <BrainRegion>MGmc</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>Pulm</BrainRegion>. <BrainRegion>retroinsular field</BrainRegion>(Ri) receives its heaviest input from <BrainRegion>posterior nucleus</BrainRegion>(Po) , with additional input from <BrainRegion>suprageniculate-limitans complex</BrainRegion>(SG-Li) , <BrainRegion>MGmc</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>Pulm</BrainRegion>, and perhaps <BrainRegion>ventroposterior inferior thalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>(VPI) . <BrainRegion>Area 7b</BrainRegion> receives its input from <BrainRegion>Pulm</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>oral division of the pulvinar</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>lateral posterior n</BrainRegion>., the <BrainRegion>medial dorsal n</BrainRegion>., and the <BrainRegion>caudal division of the ventrolateral n</BrainRegion>. These results indicate that the <BrainRegion>somatic cortical fields</BrainRegion>, except for those comprising the <BrainRegion>first somatosensory area</BrainRegion>, each receive inputs from an array of <BrainRegion>thalamic nuclei</BrainRegion>, rather than just one, and that individual <BrainRegion>thalamic somatosensory relay nuclei</BrainRegion> each project to more than one <BrainRegion>cortical field</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Intraocular grafts of fresh and freeze-stored rat <BrainRegion>hippocampal</BrainRegion> tissue: a comparison of survivability and histological and connective organization.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Intraocular grafts of rat <BrainRegion>hippocampal</BrainRegion> tissue, grafted either directly from the immature donor brains (fresh) or after storage in liquid nitrogen at -196 degrees C (freeze-stored), were compared with regard to survivability and histological and connective organization. For direct grafting, pieces of <BrainRegion>hippocampal</BrainRegion> tissue from rat embryos (embryonic day 19, E21) and newborn rats (PO) were placed in the anterior eye chamber of adult rats immediately after dissection. For grafting after deep-freeze storage, pieces of <BrainRegion>hippocampal</BrainRegion> tissue were taken from rat embryos (E16-E21) and newborn rats (PO), frozen at a cooling rate of 1 degrees C/min in CO2 or N2 vapours after addition of the cryoprotective agent dimethylsolfoxide (DMSO), and stored in liquid nitrogen for 1 to 33 days before thawing and intraocular grafting. From 20 to 68 days after grafting, the recipient rats were sacrificed, their eyes sectioned, and the sections stained with thionine for cell bodies, Timm&apos;s sulphide silver method for <BrainRegion>hippocampal</BrainRegion> fiber systems and terminal fields, and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) for cholinergic fibers and acetylcholinesterase(AChE) -positive neurons. When examining the 101 grafted eyes (34 grafted with fresh and 67 with freeze-stored tissue) a significantly lower survival rate of the freeze-stored tissue was found (28 vs. 88%). The survivability of the freeze-stored tissue was age-dependent with no survival at donor ages E16 and PO, while tissue from E18-E21 had a 50% survival rate. The grafts of the freeze-stored tissue were also smaller and showed an increased tendency for fragmentation. When evaluating the structure of the grafts, the deep-freeze storage was found primarily to have been harmful to the <BrainRegion>dentate</BrainRegion> granule cells and their precursors. The organization of intrinsic fiber connections followed the pattern known from lesion and intracerebral transplant studies. While demonstrating that immature brain tissue can survive deep-freeze storage and subsequent intraocular grafting, the study also indicates that different schemes may have to be used to get optimal survival of different neuronal populations.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Differential expression of cadherins in the developing and adult zebrafish olfactory system.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Cadherins are cell adhesion molecules that play important roles in development of a variety of tissues and maintenance of adult structures. Although cadherin expression has been studied in detail in the central nervous system of several vertebrate species, little is known of their distribution in the developing and adult <BrainRegion>olfactory structures</BrainRegion>, and there is no published report, to our knowledge, of cadherin expression in fish olfactory system. In this study, we examined expression patterns of three cadherins, cadherin-1 (E-cadherin), cadherin-2 (N-cadherin), and cadherin-4 (R-cadherin), in the olfactory system of developing and adult zebrafish by using both in situ hybridization and immunocytochemical methods. Cadherin-1 is detected in the newly formed <BrainRegion>olfactory placode</BrainRegion>, and its expression is maintained in the developing and adult <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> epithelium and <BrainRegion>olfactory nerve</BrainRegion>. Cadherin-2 is expressed in the <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> epithelium, <BrainRegion>olfactory nerve</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> of the embryonic and larval zebrafish, and its expression is reduced in the adult olfactory system. In contrast to the cadherin-1 and cadherin-2 expression, cadherin-4 is not found in the <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> epithelium, but it is detected in the larval and adult <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>, in the olfactory tract, and its targets in the <BrainRegion>telencephalon</BrainRegion>. We hypothesize that the differential expression of these three cadherins in the developing zebrafish major <BrainRegion>olfactory structures</BrainRegion> reflects functionally different roles in the development of the vertebrate olfactory system.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Movement-sensitive, polarization-sensitive, and light-sensitive neurons of the <BrainRegion>medulla</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>accessory medulla</BrainRegion> of the locust, Schistocerca gregaria.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Several lines of evidence suggest that the <BrainRegion>accessory medulla</BrainRegion> of orthopteroid insects is implicated in the control of circadian rhythms. To investigate the role of this brain area in more detail, anatomical and physiological properties of accessory-medulla neurons of the locust were studied by intracellular recordings combined with Lucifer dye injections. The responses of these neurons to visual stimuli were compared with visual responses of adjacent tangential neurons of the <BrainRegion>medulla</BrainRegion>. Principal neurons of the <BrainRegion>accessory medulla</BrainRegion> showed weak tonic excitations to stationary light stimuli, but they were not sensitive to movement stimuli or to different e-vector orientations of polarized light. These neurons connected the <BrainRegion>accessory medulla</BrainRegion> to the lamina, the <BrainRegion>anterior medulla</BrainRegion>, and to several areas in the <BrainRegion>midbrain</BrainRegion> including the <BrainRegion>superior protocerebrum</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>posterior optic tubercle</BrainRegion>. A second class of neurons had tangential arborizations in the <BrainRegion>medulla</BrainRegion>, a few sidebranches in the <BrainRegion>accessory medulla</BrainRegion>, and projections to the lamina or to the <BrainRegion>contralateral optic lobe</BrainRegion>. Several of these neurons were sensitive to polarized light. Finally, a third class of neurons had tangential arborizations in the <BrainRegion>medulla</BrainRegion> and axonal projections to the lobula and to the <BrainRegion>lateral protocerebrum</BrainRegion>. These neurons showed phasic responses to light and nondirectional selective responses to motion stimuli. The results show that neurons of the <BrainRegion>accessory medulla</BrainRegion> receive photic input and support an involvement of this neuropil in circadian timekeeping functions. The possible role of the <BrainRegion>accessory medulla</BrainRegion> in polarization vision is discussed.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Distribution of transient receptor potential channels in the rat carotid chemosensory pathway.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Glomus cells in the carotid body respond to decreases in oxygen tension of the blood and transmit this sensory information in the carotid sinus nerve to the brain via neurons in the petrosal ganglion. G-protein-coupled membrane receptors linked to phospholipase C may play an important role in this response through the activation of the cation channels formed by the transient receptor potential (TRP) proteins. In the present study, expression of transient receptor potential(TRP) C proteins in the rat carotid body and petrosal ganglion was examined using immunohistochemical techniques. transient receptor potential(TRP) C3, transient receptor potential(TRP) C4, transient receptor potential(TRP) C5, transient receptor potential(TRP) C6, and transient receptor potential(TRP) C7 were present in neurons throughout the ganglion. transient receptor potential(TRP) C1 was expressed in only 28% of petrosal neurons, and of this population, 45% were tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive, accounting for essentially all the tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) -expressing neurons in the ganglion. Because tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) -positive neurons project to the carotid body, this result suggests that transient receptor potential(TRP) C1 is selectively associated with the chemosensory pathway. Confocal images through the carotid body showed that transient receptor potential(TRP) C1/3/4/5/6 proteins localize to the carotid sinus nerve fibers, some of which were immunoreactive to an anti-neurofilament (NF) antibody cocktail. transient receptor potential(TRP) C1 and transient receptor potential(TRP) C3 were present in both anti-neurofilament(NF) -positive and anti-neurofilament(NF) -negative fibers, whereas TPRC4, transient receptor potential(TRP) C5, and transient receptor potential(TRP) C6 expression was primarily localized to anti-neurofilament(NF) -negative fibers. Only transient receptor potential(TRP) C1 and transient receptor potential(TRP) C4 were localized in the afferent nerve terminals that encircle individual glomus cells. transient receptor potential(TRP) C7 was not expressed in sensory fibers. All the transient receptor potential(TRP) C proteins studied were present in type I glomus cells. Although their role as receptor-activated cation channels in the chemosensory pathway is yet to be established, the presence of transient receptor potential(TRP) C channels in glomus cells and sensory nerves of the carotid body suggests a role in facilitating and/or sustaining the hypoxic response.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Postembedding immunocytochemistry demonstrates directly that both <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> terminals in the cat <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion> are glutamate immunoreactive.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Although the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate is known to be present in the cat <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion> (SC), the types of synapses that contain glutamate have not been examined. We, therefore, studied the ultrastructure of synaptic profiles labeled by a glutamate antibody by using electron microscopic postembedding immunocytochemistry. In addition, unilateral aspiration lesions of <BrainRegion>areas 17-18</BrainRegion> were made at 5-28 days before death in order to determine whether degenerating terminals from <BrainRegion>visual cortex</BrainRegion> were glutamate immunoreactive (Glu-ir). Three types of axon terminal were glu-ir: 1) those containing large, round synaptic vesicles and pale mitochondria, characteristic of <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> terminals (RT profiles); 2) those containing small, round synaptic vesicles and dark mitochondria (RSD profiles); and 3) those containing large, round synaptic vesicles and dark mitochondria (RLD profiles). Measures of mean gold particle density revealed that RT, RSD, and RLD profiles had similar average grain densities (11.3-12.7 particles/unit area). Other labeled profile types included cell bodies, large-calibre dendrites, and myelinated axons. Axon terminals containing flattened synaptic vesicles and vesicle-containing presynaptic dendrites, both of which contain gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), had many fewer gold particles (3.6 and 4.8 mean particles/unit area, respectively). Following unilateral removal of <BrainRegion>visual cortex</BrainRegion>, normal RSD terminals were observed infrequently in the <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion>(SC) ipsilateral to the lesion. Synaptic terminals in the initial stages of degeneration were heavily labeled by the glutamate antibody, as were axon terminals and myelinated axons undergoing hypertrophied or neurofilamentous degeneration. These results show that both major sensory afferents to the superficial layers of cat <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion>(SC) contain glutamate--RT terminals from the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> and RSD terminals from <BrainRegion>visual cortex</BrainRegion>. The origin of RLD terminals is unknown.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Growth of central nervous system <BrainRegion>auditory and visual nuclei</BrainRegion> in the postnatal gerbil (Meriones unguiculatus).</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The objective of the present study was, by using the Mongolian gerbil (Meriones unguiculatus) as an animal model, to provide data on the growth dynamics of <BrainRegion>central auditory and visual nuclei</BrainRegion> and to relate the growth of these structures to the growth of the entire brain. So far, no such systematic study has been performed in any mammalian species. The knowledge of the rates of development of central nervous sensory structures might be useful for understanding the contribution of the central nervous system to maturation of sensory processing. Increases in volumes of nuclei and changes in their shape were analyzed for animals at the day of birth (P0); at postnatal days P7, P15, P22, P28; and in the third month (P90). The <BrainRegion>auditory nuclei</BrainRegion> investigated were the <BrainRegion>cochlear nucleus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>superior olivary complex</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>nuclei of the lateral lemniscus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>inferior colliculus</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>medial geniculate body</BrainRegion>. From the visual system, the <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate body</BrainRegion> were studied. At P15 (shortly after the onset of central auditory responsiveness), the volumes of all <BrainRegion>auditory nuclei</BrainRegion> examined reached only 60-70% of their adult sizes; i.e., they showed considerable growth afterwards. At the same time (shortly before the animals open their eyes), the <BrainRegion>visual nuclei</BrainRegion> had almost reached their adult sizes (superior colliculus, 91%; lateral geniculate nucleus, 97%). These data demonstrate that different sensory nuclei contribute in highly different fashions to brain growth. There are system-specific differences in growth dynamics between <BrainRegion>central auditory and visual nuclei</BrainRegion>. However, the absolute growth of nuclei in both sensory systems relates to the brain regions. The data do not support the idea of a peripheral-to-central gradient in the growth of <BrainRegion>central auditory nuclei</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Synaptic organization in the lamina of the superposition eye of a skipper butterfly, Parnara guttata.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The first <BrainRegion>optic</BrainRegion> neuropil of the <BrainRegion>compound eye</BrainRegion>, the lamina, of the skipper butterfly Parnara guttata, was examined by light microscopy after Golgi-impregnation and by electron microscopy (EM) to clarify the cellular and synaptic organization. In the lamina, five different types of lamina neurons (L neurons) were characterized by using Golgi-impregnation. By electron microscopy(EM) , each cartridge was found to contain all nine receptor axons from an ommatidium, five lamina neurons(L neurons) , and a few putative centrifugal elements. Axons from photoreceptors (retinula cells) R2, R3, R4, R6, R7, and R8 terminate as short visual fibers (svfs) in the lamina cartridge. Those from R1, R5, and R9 penetrate the lamina and terminate in the medulla as long visual fibers (lvfs). In the cartridges, the synaptic contacts were formed from short visual fibers(svfs) onto lamina neurons(L neurons) , from the long visual fibers(lvfs) of R1 and/or R5 to the lvf of R9 and lamina neurons(L neurons) , and from the lvf of R9 to lamina neurons(L neurons) . The putative centrifugal fibers also make synapses to short visual fibers(svfs) and lamina neurons(L neurons) . At the most distal level of the cartridge, one of the centrifugal fibers containing dense-core vesicles makes presynaptic contacts to the putative long collaterals of the L neuron. A novel characteristic feature of this lamina is that short visual fibers(svfs) of R3 and R7 and the long visual fibers(lvfs) of R1 or R5 have long collaterals extending into neighboring cartridges. Presynaptic contacts were confirmed in such long collaterals from the svf. These results imply that receptor axons provide direct intercartridge connections as well as providing indirect connections to neighboring cartridges by way of their input upon lamina neurons(L neurons) .</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Anatomic mapping of neuronal odor responses in the developing rat <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Behavioral evidence indicates that altricial mammals possess <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> function at early developmental ages, before the <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> has matured anatomically. We monitored the early anatomic and functional development of the <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> in rat pups stimulated with odors using in situ localization of c-fos mRNA to identify responsive postsynaptic neurons. Odor-specific spatial patterns of neuronal activation in the glomerular layer were evident from birth, were sharply defined rather than diffuse, and remained relatively unchanged in terms of their <BrainRegion>bulbar</BrainRegion> distribution during the first 3 postnatal weeks. In neonates, focal postsynaptic responses in the glomerular layer occurred in the form of clusters of activated tufted neurons. Broad zones of activated mitral cells were located beneath these cell clusters, with scattered neurons in the underlying granule cell layer also expressing c-fos. The cellular composition of these functional neuronal groups shifted from predominantly output neurons at the earliest ages, to increasing incorporation of interneurons as they developed postnatally. The characteristic distribution of activated neurons in the mature glomerular layer, in which the boundaries of individual glomeruli are precisely defined by cells expressing c-fos, emerged near the end of the first week. Broad zones of cRNA hybridization in the mitral cell layer became increasingly restricted as the size of the activated granule cell population increased postnatally, correlating with the functional maturation of inhibitory circuitry. These results provide evidence that the types and distributions of neurons collectively activated by sensory input to glomeruli change as the rat <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> matures and that distinct, functional odor maps in the glomerular layer are established from birth.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Is there tonic activity in the endogenous opioid systems? A c-Fos study in the rat central nervous system after intravenous injection of naloxone or naloxone-methiodide.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>This study examined the possibility that a tonic activity in the endogenous opioid systems (EO systems) exists in animals under normal conditions. In a first set of experiments, concurrent changes in behavioral responses and in the numbers of c-Fos-like immunoreactive (Fos-LI) neurons in 58 structures of the brain and <BrainRegion>lumbosacral spinal cord</BrainRegion> were analyzed in rats after systemic administration of the opioid antagonist naloxone (NAL; 2 mg/kg). Possible roles of the endogenous opioid systems(EO systems) were inferred from changes in the numbers of c-Fos-like immunoreactive(Fos-LI) neurons between normal rats that received either naloxone(NAL) or the same volume of saline. Free-floating sections were processed immunohistochemically for c-Fos protein using standard avidin-biotin complex methods. After naloxone(NAL) , the numbers of c-Fos-like immunoreactive(Fos-LI) neurons were significantly increased in the <BrainRegion>area postrema</BrainRegion>; in the <BrainRegion>caudal, intermediate, and rostral parts of the nucleus tractus solitari</BrainRegion>i; in the <BrainRegion>rostral ventrolateral medulla</BrainRegion>; in the <BrainRegion>Kölliker-Fuse nucleus</BrainRegion>; in the <BrainRegion>supramammillary nucleus</BrainRegion>; and in the <BrainRegion>central nucleus of the amygdala</BrainRegion>. In a second set of experiments examining changes in c-Fos expression in the latter structures, similar increases were found after naloxone(NAL) but not after an equimolar dose of naloxone(NAL) -methiodide, a preferential, peripherally acting opioid receptor antagonist. Therefore, c-Fos-like immunoreactive(Fos-LI) was likely triggered after blockade of central opioid receptors, but not peripheral opioid receptors, releasing neurons from EO system-mediated inhibition. The results of this study suggest the existence of a tonic activity of the endogenous opioid systems(EO systems) exerted on a restricted number of brain regions in normal rats. This tonic activity of the endogenous opioid systems(EO systems) may control part of the neural networks involved in cardiorespiratory functions and in emotional and learning processes.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Morphological features of neurons containing calcium-binding proteins in the human <BrainRegion>striatum</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>An immunohistochemical approach was used to characterize the morphological phenotype of neurons containing the calcium-binding proteins calretinin (CR), parvalbumin (PV), or calbindin-D28k (CB) in the normal human <BrainRegion>striatum</BrainRegion>. The protein calretinin(CR) occurs in at least four morphologically distinct types of neurons. Apart from the numerous medium-sized aspiny interneurons and the less abundant giant aspiny interneurons, calretinin(CR) also labels some medium-sized spiny neurons morphologically identical to <BrainRegion>striatal</BrainRegion> projection neurons. This finding indicates that calretinin(CR) is not only confined to <BrainRegion>striatal</BrainRegion> interneurons but also may be involved in the function of certain projection neurons. Some small and peculiar bushy-like aspiny neurons also are enriched with calretinin(CR) . These neurons could correspond to the dwarf or neurogliform neurons first described by Ramón y Cajal (1911). Three types of parvalbumin(PV) -immunoreactive <BrainRegion>striatal</BrainRegion> neurons can be visualized in the human <BrainRegion>striatum</BrainRegion>: 1) the common medium-sized aspiny leptodendritic neurons, 2) some smaller and profusely arborized aspiny neurons, and 3) a few large and intensely stained neurons with conspicuously beaded and poorly branched dendrites. The protein calbindin-D28k(CB) labels virtually all medium-sized spiny projection neurons located in the <BrainRegion>striatal</BrainRegion> matrix but also identifies a small subset of large and more intensely immunostained aspiny neurons. The latter finding indicates that calbindin-D28k(CB) is not entirely confined to <BrainRegion>striatal</BrainRegion> projection neurons but also may play a role in local circuit neurons. These normative data should help our understanding of the chemical anatomy of the human <BrainRegion>striatum</BrainRegion> in both health and disease.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Glomerular formation in the developing rat <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Using the confocal microscope together with markers for the cellular components of glomeruli, we examined the spatiotemporal cellular interactions that occur between the axons of <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> receptor cells, their dendritic targets, and glial cells during the critical period of glomerular formation. We have employed markers of immature and mature <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> receptor cell axons, mitral/tufted cell dendrites, and glial cells as well as a synapse-associated protein for double- and triple-label immunocytochemistry. Axons of <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> receptor cells grew into a dense dendritic zone of the <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> (comprising the dendrites of both mitral and tufted cells) between E17 and E18. At E19, these axons coalesced into protoglomeruli, which continued to develop until birth, when the basic anatomical structure of adult glomeruli emerged. Neither mitral/tufted cell dendrites nor <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> astrocytes became specifically associated with these protoglomeruli until E21. Ensheathing cells remained restricted to the outer nerve fiber layer and did not appear to contribute to glomerular formation. Finally, the synaptophysin staining has shown that synaptic constituents are expressed as early as E17, prior to the appearance of mature <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> receptor cell axons. Based on these data, we have established a time line detailing the temporal and spatial interactions that occur between cell types during late embryonic rat <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> development. We conclude that the initial event in the formation of glomeruli is the penetration of the mitral/tufted cell dendritic zone by <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> receptor cell axons. The coalescence of dendritic and glial processes into glomerular structures appears secondary to the arrival of the <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> receptor cell axons.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Activin mRNA induced during <BrainRegion>amygdala</BrainRegion> kindling shows a spatiotemporal progression that tracks the spread of seizures.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The progressive development of seizures in rats by <BrainRegion>amygdala</BrainRegion> kindling, which models <BrainRegion>temporal lobe</BrainRegion> epilepsy, allows the study of molecular regulators of enduring synaptic changes. Neurotrophins play important roles in synaptic plasticity and neuroprotection. Activin, a member of the transforming growth factor-beta superfamily of growth and differentiation factors, has recently been added to the list of candidate synaptic regulators. We mapped the induction of activin betaA mRNA in <BrainRegion>amygdala</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion> at several stages of seizure development. Strong induction, measured 2 hours after the first stage 2 (partial) seizure, appeared in neurons of the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral amygdala</BrainRegion> (confined to the <BrainRegion>lateral, basal, and posterior cortical nuclei</BrainRegion>) and <BrainRegion>insular</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>piriform</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>orbital</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>infralimbic cortices</BrainRegion>. Activin betaA marker of gamma-aminobutyric acidergic neurons(mRNA) induction, after the first stage 5 (generalized) seizure, had spread to the <BrainRegion>contralateral amygdala</BrainRegion> (same nuclear distribution) and <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion>, and the induced labeling covered much of the convexity of <BrainRegion>neocortex</BrainRegion> as well as <BrainRegion>piriform</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>perirhinal</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>entorhinal cortices</BrainRegion> in a nearly bilaterally symmetrical pattern. This pattern had filled in by the sixth stage 5 seizure. Induced labeling in <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> neurons was confined mainly to layer II. A similar temporal and spatial pattern of increased marker of gamma-aminobutyric acidergic neurons(mRNA) expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was found in the <BrainRegion>amygdala</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion>. Activin betaA and brain-derived neurotrophic factor(BDNF) expression patterns were similar at 1, 2, and 6 hours after the last seizure, subsiding at 24 hours; in contrast, c-fos marker of gamma-aminobutyric acidergic neurons(mRNA) induction appeared only at 1 hour throughout <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion> and then subsided. In double-label studies, activin betaA marker of gamma-aminobutyric acidergic neurons(mRNA) -positive neurons were also brain-derived neurotrophic factor(BDNF) marker of gamma-aminobutyric acidergic neurons(mRNA) positive, and they did not colocalize with GAD67 marker of gamma-aminobutyric acidergic neurons(mRNA) (a marker of gamma-aminobutyric acidergic neurons). The data suggest that activin and brain-derived neurotrophic factor(BDNF) transcriptional activities accurately mark excitatory neurons participating in seizure-induced synaptic alterations and may contribute to the enduring changes that underlie the kindled state.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Cell growth in the <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion> of kittens following the opening or closing of one eye.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Closing one eye of kittens at 23 days after birth resulted in paler Nissl staining of the deprived cells in the <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN)</BrainRegion> that was detectable two days later. Differences between the two sides of the brain in mean cell area increased to a peak in binocular lamina A at 4--6 days after eyelid suture, and then fell to a trough at eight days before rising progressively to a higher level at 31 days. In lamina A1 the peak and trough were later. Opening one eye of kittens after 23 days of binocular closure from birth resulted in more intense Nissl staining of the stimulated cells in the <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus(LGN)</BrainRegion> that was detectable four days later. The stimulated cells grew faster than the cells connected to the eye that remained closed, and this differential growth reached a peak at 17 days in binocular lamina A and at 21 days in lamina A1 before falling to a trough at 26--31 days. These results are compared with the time course of anabolic changes that have been measured in other neurons during stimulation. The coefficient of variation of cell size was computed and found to be slightly decreased for deprived cells and increased for stimulated cells. This suggests that larger cells changes their sizes proportionately more than smaller cells. The cells were measured in fronzen sections without shrinkage, and the areas are at least 25% larger than those reported previously after paraffin or celloidin embedding.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>GABA-immunoreactive boutons contact identified OFF and ON cells in the <BrainRegion>nucleus raphe magnus</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The <BrainRegion>pontomedullary raphe magnus</BrainRegion> (RM) contains two physiologically defined types of neurons that participate in the opioid-induced modulation of <BrainRegion>dorsal horn</BrainRegion> nociceptive messages: OFF cells, which decrease, and ON cells, which increase their discharge rates when reflex behavior is evoked by noxious pinch or heat. Because both types of neuron have inhibitory inputs and because there is evidence that gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) inhibitory mechanisms within <BrainRegion>raphe magnus</BrainRegion>(RM) contribute to the antinociceptive action of opioids, we have sought anatomical evidence for a direct gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) ergic input to OFF and ON cells. In this study, cells of each type located in the <BrainRegion>raphe magnus</BrainRegion>(RM) were electrophysiologically defined and intracellularly filled with horseradish peroxidase or Neurobiotin. One cell of each type was labeled in the cat, and 2-3 cells of each type were labeled in the rat. Thin sections were labeled by a postembedding immunogold procedure by using an antibody directed against glutaraldehyde-conjugated gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) . gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) -immunoreactive ( gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) -ir) boutons contained small, round, clear vesicles and made symmetrical synapses with identified dendrites. gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) -ir boutons were apposed to soma and to proximal and distal dendrites of both cell types in both species. These findings demonstrate direct gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) ergic input to identified OFF and ON cells in the <BrainRegion>raphe magnus</BrainRegion>(RM) . J. Comp.

<ArticleTitle>Neurotoxic action of kainic acid in the isolated toad and goldfish <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>: II. Mechanism of action.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The specificity and mechanism of the neurotoxic action of kainic acid (KA) was investigated by histological methods in the isolated <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> of toads and goldfish. Particular attention was paid to the earliest and most sensitive response to kainic acid(KA) in the outer plexiform layer (OPL). Of 21 compounds tested as potential mimics of kainic acid(KA) neurotoxicity in the outer plexiform layer(OPL) , only the enantiomers of glutamate and aspartate mimicked kainic acid(KA) , inducing a low-level neurotoxic effect at concentrations 5,000-10,000-fold higher than concentrations of kainic acid(KA) giving comparable effects. Further, of 22 compounds tested as potential blockers of kainic acid(KA) neurotoxicity in the outer plexiform layer(OPL) , only D-gamma-glutamylglycine, D,L-alpha-amino pimelic acid, sodium pentobarbital, D,L-alpha-amino adipic acid, L-glutamate, and L-aspartate blocked kainic acid(KA) neurotoxicity (IC50 values of 0.1, 0.3, 0.3, 2, 5, and 15 mM, respectively). In ionic substitution experiments, kainic acid(KA) -induced vacuolization was found to require sodium and chloride ions but not calcium ions in the extracellular medium. These findings support the hypothesis that kainic acid(KA) combines with specific receptors in the membrane of susceptible neurons in the <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> outer plexiform layer(OPL) , leading to prolonged opening of membrane channels permeable to sodium and potassium ions. An accompanying equilibrating chloride influx may result in intracellular ion excess, leading to osmotic swelling and vacuolization. The membrane receptors involved in mediating the action of kainic acid(KA) in the outer plexiform layer(OPL) are likely to be a class of postsynaptic or extrasynaptic glutamate receptor.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Hyperplasia in the <BrainRegion>spinal</BrainRegion> sensory system of the frog. II. Central and peripheral connectivity patterns.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Central and peripheral connectivity patterns of hyperplastic dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) in Rana pipiens are examined in order to determine the relative roles of peripheral and central contacts in the production of DRG hyperplasias. The hyperplasias are produced in the intact hindlimb DRGs after the removal in tadpoles and young postmetamorphic frogs of neighboring DRGs (Davis and Constantine-Paton, &apos;83). The peripheral target zones of the hyperplastic DRGs, determined by physiological recordings of sensory receptive fields, are found to undergo a significant degree of expansion relative to controls. Peripheral expansion is most pronounced in caudalmost DRG 10, and this effect occurs in experimental animals operated during larval and postmetamorphic stages. Further, anatomical labelling of peripheral sensory fibers coursing to the hindlimb reveals that the hyperplastic DRG 10 actually contains additional fibers projecting to the denervated regions. The central projection of the hyperplastic DRG 10 does not show corresponding increases in longitudinal arborization after the application of horseradish peroxidase to the appropriate dorsal roots. These observations are made on some of the same experimental animals in which peripheral fields are shown to have vastly expanded. We conclude that the peripheral processes of the hyperplastic DRGs are less rigidly specified than the central terminations, and that it is the periphery which plays the primary role in controlling the cell numbers increases. A second aim of this investigation is to identify whether sexually dimorphic connectivity patterns in normal frogs explain the production of DRG 10 hyperplasias exclusively in male experimental animals (Davis and Constantine-Paton, '83). We apply the same techniques used in our connectivity studies of hyperplastic DRGs to the investigation of connectivity patterns of DRG 10s in normal males and females. No sex-dependent differences in peripheral and central connectivity are found. Thus, since normal male and female frogs possess an equivalent amount of target space for DRG 10, the unique production of hyperplasias in male experimental animals cannot be explained solely on the basis of connectivity. We speculate on what other factors may be involved.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Immunolocalization of sodium channel isoform NaCh6 in the nervous system.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Sodium channel 6 (NaCh6) is the alpha-subunit of a voltage-gated sodium channel expressed in the rat nervous system. The mRNA for this isoform has been shown to be expressed in both neuronal and glial cells by in situ hybridization. To examine localization of NaCh6 protein, polyclonal antibodies specific for NaCh6 were generated against peptides from two cytoplasmic domains and a fusion protein from an extracellular domain. Affinity-purified antibodies were used to localize NaCh6 in the brain, <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>, peripheral nervous system, and neuromuscular junction. There was widespread labeling of neurons in the brain and <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>. NaCh6 was present in both sensory and motor pathways. Radial glial cells in the <BrainRegion>cerebellum</BrainRegion> were intensely labeled for both GFAP and NaCh6. At the subcellular level, NaCh6 is found in axons, dendrites, and the cell body. Motor neurons and primary sensory neurons in dorsal root ganglia had strong cytoplasmic and axonal staining. Nodes of Ranvier in peripheral nerve and in the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> were also intensely labeled. Motor neuron axons near the neuromuscular junction were labeled up to, but not including, terminal boutons. Dendrites of pyramidal cells in the <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>cerebellum</BrainRegion> were labeled. NaCh6 is the first NaCh subtype to be localized either at the node of Ranvier or to a dendrite. We conclude that NaCh6 is widely distributed in the central and peripheral nervous systems and is likely to be important for the electrical properties of the axon and dendrite.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Distribution of cells containing mRNAs encoding substance P and neurokinin B in the rat central nervous system.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The family of tachykinins includes the neuropeptides substance P, neurokinin A, and neurokinin B. The distribution of substance P in the central nervous system has been studied immunohistochemically but the lack of specific antibodies has prevented similar studies of neurokinin B. Recent molecular genetics techniques have revealed the sequences for the complementary DNAs that code for the substance P and neurokinin B precursors. These results have permitted the design of specific probes to differentiate between substance P and neurokinin B transcripts by using in situ hybridization histochemistry. Our probes, 48-base synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides labeled with 35S revealed extensive and distinct patterns of cell labeling for both substance P and neurokinin B throughout the rat central nervous system. The distribution of substance-P-mRNA-containing cells that we observed confirmed and extended previous immunocytochemical descriptions. Cells containing transcripts for either tachykinin were present in the <BrainRegion>neocortex</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> and associated areas, <BrainRegion>caudate-putamen</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>medial habenula</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>central gray, and dorsal horn of the spinal cord</BrainRegion>. However, their distributions within these areas were usually quite different. Other areas contained only one tachykinin cell type: e.g., the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract</BrainRegion> contained only neurokinin B cells whereas the <BrainRegion>raphe nuclei</BrainRegion> had only substance P cells. This study demonstrates the sensitivity and specificity of in situ hybridization histochemistry for mapping peptidergic neurons and lays the foundation for further investigations of the roles of these two tachykinins in the central nervous system.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Spatial exploration induces ARC, a plasticity-related immediate-early gene, only in calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II-positive principal excitatory and inhibitory neurons of the rat <BrainRegion>forebrain</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Active behavior, such as exploring a novel environment, induces the expression of the immediate-early gene Arc (activity-regulated cytoskeletal associated protein, or Arg 3.1) in many brain regions, including the <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>neocortex</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>striatum</BrainRegion>. activity-regulated cytoskeletal associated protein(Arc) messenger ribonucleic acid and protein are localized in activated dendrites, and activity-regulated cytoskeletal associated protein(Arc) protein is required for the maintenance of long-term potentiation and memory consolidation. Although previous evidence suggests that activity-regulated cytoskeletal associated protein(Arc) is expressed in neurons, there is no direct demonstration that only neurons can express activity-regulated cytoskeletal associated protein(Arc) . Furthermore, there is no characterization of the main neuronal types that express activity-regulated cytoskeletal associated protein(Arc) . The data reported here show that behavior- or seizure-induced activity-regulated cytoskeletal associated protein(Arc) expression in the <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>primary somatosensory cortex</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>dorsal striatum</BrainRegion> of rats colocalizes only with neuronal (NeuN-positive) and not with glial (GFAP-positive) cells. Furthermore, activity-regulated cytoskeletal associated protein(Arc) was found exclusively in non-GABAergic alpha-CaMKII-positive <BrainRegion>hippocampal</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>neocortical</BrainRegion> neurons of rats that had explored a novel environment. Some GAD65/67-positive neurons in these regions were observed to express activity-regulated cytoskeletal associated protein(Arc) , but only after a very strong stimulus (electroconvulsive seizure). In the <BrainRegion>dorsal striatum</BrainRegion>, spatial exploration induced activity-regulated cytoskeletal associated protein(Arc) only in GABAergic and alpha-CaMKII-positive neurons. Combined, these results show that although a very strong stimulus (seizure) can induce activity-regulated cytoskeletal associated protein(Arc) in a variety of neurons, behavior induces activity-regulated cytoskeletal associated protein(Arc) in the CaMKII-positive principal neurons of the <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>neocortex</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>dorsal striatum</BrainRegion>. These results, coupled with recent in vitro findings of interactions between activity-regulated cytoskeletal associated protein(Arc) and CaMKII, are consistent with the hypothesis that activity-regulated cytoskeletal associated protein(Arc) and CaMKII act as plasticity partners to promote functional and/or structural synaptic modifications that accompany learning.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Some observations on <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> inputs to the macaque monkey <BrainRegion>amygdala</BrainRegion>: an anterograde tracing study.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>We have previously described the origins of <BrainRegion>neocortical</BrainRegion> inputs to the <BrainRegion>lateral nucleus</BrainRegion> of the macaque monkey <BrainRegion>amygdala</BrainRegion> based on retrograde tracing studies. Here we report results from studies that have attempted to confirm the projections from several candidate afferent regions using (3)H-amino acid autoradiography as an anterograde tracer. We have charted, based on the results of 33 separate injections, the topographic distribution of <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> projections throughout the <BrainRegion>amygdala</BrainRegion>. <BrainRegion>Areas TE</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>TEO</BrainRegion> of the <BrainRegion>inferotemporal cortex</BrainRegion>, portions of the <BrainRegion>superior temporal gyrus</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>granular region of the insula</BrainRegion> project primarily to the <BrainRegion>lateral nucleus</BrainRegion>, with little or no innervation of other <BrainRegion>amygdaloid nuclei</BrainRegion>. In contrast, <BrainRegion>orbitofrontal</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>medial prefrontal</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>anterior cingulate</BrainRegion> regions project primarily to the <BrainRegion>basal</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>accessory basal nuclei</BrainRegion> and provide little innervation to the <BrainRegion>lateral nucleus</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>orbitofrontal</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>medial prefrontal cortices</BrainRegion>, but not the <BrainRegion>anterior cingulate cortex</BrainRegion>, project to medially situated <BrainRegion>amygdaloid areas</BrainRegion> such as the <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>medial nuclei</BrainRegion> and to the <BrainRegion>periamygdaloid cortex</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>agranular and dysgranular insula</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>parainsula</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>rostral portions of the superior temporal gyrus</BrainRegion> project both to the <BrainRegion>lateral, basal, and accessory basal nuclei</BrainRegion> and to the <BrainRegion>medially situated nuclei</BrainRegion>. Projections to the <BrainRegion>central nucleus</BrainRegion> are particularly prominent from these regions. These data are discussed in relation to the hierarchical processing of sensory information that occurs within the <BrainRegion>amygdaloid complex</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Spontaneous regeneration of the corticospinal tract after transection in young rats: collagen type IV deposition and astrocytic scar in the lesion site are not the cause but the effect of failure of regeneration.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>In young rats the corticospinal tract regenerated after a single transection of the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> with a sharp blade, but regeneration failed if the transection was repeated to make a more traumatic injury. To identify cells and associated molecules that promote or impede regeneration, we compared expression of collagen type IV, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and vimentin immunoreactivity (IR) at the lesion sites in combination with anterograde axonal tracing between animals with two types of transection. Axonal regeneration occurred as early as 18 hours after transection; regenerating axons penetrated vessel-like structures with collagen type IV- immunoreactivity(IR) at the lesion site, while reactive astrocytes coexpressing glial fibrillary acidic protein(GFAP) - and vimentin- immunoreactivity(IR) appeared in the lesioned white matter. In contrast, when regeneration failed astrocytes were absent near the lesion. By 7 days sheet-like structures with collagen type IV- immunoreactivity(IR) and astrocytic scar appeared in the lesioned white matter and persisted until the end of the observation period (31 days). On the basis of their spatiotemporal appearance, collagen type IV- immunoreactivity(IR) sheet-like structures and the astrocytic scar follow, rather than cause, the failure of regeneration. The major sign, and perhaps cause, of failure of axonal regeneration is likely the prolonged disappearance of astrocytes around the lesion site in the early postinjury period.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Visual and auditory association areas</BrainRegion> of the cat&apos;s <BrainRegion>posterior ectosylvian gyrus</BrainRegion>: <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> afferents.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>In a preceding report, we described patterns of <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> retrograde labeling following 17 tracer deposits on the cat&apos;s <BrainRegion>posterior ectosylvian gyrus</BrainRegion> and concluded, on the basis of patterns of <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> connectivity, that the <BrainRegion>posterior ectosylvian gyrus</BrainRegion> is composed of three major divisions: a <BrainRegion>tonotopic auditory zone</BrainRegion> located anteriorly, a belt of <BrainRegion>auditory association cortex</BrainRegion> occupying the <BrainRegion>gyral crown</BrainRegion>, and a <BrainRegion>visual belt</BrainRegion> located posteriorly. We describe here patterns of transcortical retrograde labeling obtained from tracer deposits in the three zones so defined. Our results indicate that the tonotopic <BrainRegion>auditory strip</BrainRegion> is innervated primarily by axons from low-order <BrainRegion>auditory areas</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>AAF, AI, P, VP, and V</BrainRegion>), that the <BrainRegion>auditory belt</BrainRegion> receives its strongest input from <BrainRegion>nontonotopic auditory fields</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>AII</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>temporal cortex</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>other parts of the auditory belt</BrainRegion>), and that projections to the <BrainRegion>visual belt</BrainRegion> derive primarily from <BrainRegion>extrastriate visual areas</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>ALLS</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>PLLS</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>DLS</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>19</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>20</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>21</BrainRegion>) and from association areas affiliated with the visual system (<BrainRegion>insular cortex</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>posterior cingulate gyrus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>area 7p</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>frontal cortex</BrainRegion>). We discuss the results in relation to previous systems for parcellating the <BrainRegion>posterior ectosylvian gyrus</BrainRegion> of the cat and consider the possibility that divisions of the feline <BrainRegion>posterior ectosylvian gyrus</BrainRegion> correspond directly to areas making up the <BrainRegion>superior temporal gyrus</BrainRegion> in primates.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Somatostatin-like immunoreactive material in the rabbit <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>: immunohistochemical staining using monoclonal antibodies.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Two mouse monoclonal antibodies to somatostatin-14 were used with avidin-biotin-peroxidase immunohistochemical technique to examine the rabbit <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>. In agreement with a previous study using a polyclonal anti-serum, a sparse population (about 1,000 per <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>) of neurons in the ganglion cell layer are immunoreactive for somatostatin; the vast majority of these cells are inferior to the myelinated fiber bundle. In addition, the monoclonal antibodies disclose a second neuronal population that forms a circumferential band of immunoreactive neurons around the extreme periphery of the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>. The cells in the body of the <BrainRegion>inferior retina</BrainRegion> have dendrites that ramify in the inner plexiform layer. Both the circumferential band of cells and the cells in the body of the <BrainRegion>inferior retina</BrainRegion> give off axonlike processes that run in the inner plexiform layer and do not enter the <BrainRegion>optic nerve</BrainRegion>. These long, straight varicose fibers form a meshwork that covers the <BrainRegion>entire retina</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>superior retina</BrainRegion>, which contains only rare immunoreactive cell bodies, has a plexus of stained fibers comparable to that of the <BrainRegion>inferior retina</BrainRegion>. The circumferential band of cells is relatively resistant to the neurotoxin kainic acid, explaining a previously reported observation that this toxin depletes only about 50% of the content of somatostatin-like immunoreactivity from the rabbit <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>. Moreover, the somatostatin immunoreactive neurons are not labeled by the intraocular injection of the fluorescent dye DAPI, which labels the cholinergic displaced amacrine cells of the rabbit <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>. These observations imply that somatostatin-like immunoreactivity is localized to two populations of associational ganglion cells, neurons with cell bodies in the ganglion cell layer, the axons of which remain within the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>L-glutamic acid decarboxylase- and gamma-aminobutyric acid-immunoreactive bipolar cells in tiger salamander <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> are of ON- and OFF-response types as inferred from Lucifer Yellow injection.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The bipolar cells in vertebrate <BrainRegion>retinas</BrainRegion> are considered to be excitatory in nature and use L-glutamate as their neurotransmitter. Our earlier studies have provided evidence demonstrating that a small but significant population of orthotopic bipolar cells in salamander <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> may be gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic. In this work, the stratification levels of axon terminals in the inner plexiform layer (IPL) of single L-glutamic acid decarboxylase-immunoreactive (GAD-IR) and gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) -immunoreactive ( gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) -IR) bipolar cells in the salamander <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> slices were studied. L-glutamic acid decarboxylase-immunoreactive(GAD-IR) and gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) -IR bipolar cells marked by a fluorescent probe, Texas Red, were injected with Lucifer Yellow (LY) through a patch pipette under visual control. A total number of 42 L-glutamic acid decarboxylase-immunoreactive(GAD-IR) bipolar cells in 24 slices and 84 gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) -IR bipolar cells in 56 slices were injected. Among these, terminals of nine L-glutamic acid decarboxylase-immunoreactive(GAD-IR) bipolar cells and 22 gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) -IR bipolar cells were sufficiently filled with Lucifer Yellow(LY) for determination of the stratification levels in the inner plexiform layer(IPL) . The stratification patterns and levels of L-glutamic acid decarboxylase-immunoreactive(GAD-IR) and gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) -IR bipolar cells were very similar. L-glutamic acid decarboxylase-immunoreactive(GAD-IR) and gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) -IR orthotopic type I and type II bipolar cells (soma located in the most distal or middle of the inner nuclear layer [INL], respectively), had their axon terminals stratified in sublamina a and sublamina b of the inner plexiform layer(IPL) with comparable frequency. Axonal processes were restricted largely to either the distal or the proximal region within sublaminae a and b. In addition, three of the bipolar cells had their terminals located in the middle region of the inner plexiform layer(IPL) . The similarities of stratification patterns and levels between L-glutamic acid decarboxylase-immunoreactive(GAD-IR) and gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) -IR type I and type II bipolar cells indicate that they represent the same population of presumed gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) ergic bipolar cells. Based on comparative stratifications of gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) bipolar cells reported here and those derived from electrophysiological studies (Hensley et al. [1993] J. Neurophysiol. 69:2086-2098), it is suggested that putative gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) ergic bipolar cells represent cone-dominated and rod-dominated ON- and OFF-bipolar cells and that they subserve a broad role in the ON- and OFF-visual pathways in the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Neuronal and astrocyte expression of nicotinic receptor subunit beta4 in the adult mouse brain.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) expression and function are customized in different brain regions through assembling receptors from closely related but genetically distinct subunits. Immunohistochemical analysis of one of these subunits, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor(nAChR) beta4, in the mouse brain suggests an extensive and potentially diverse role for this subunit in both excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission. Prominent immunostaining included: 1) the <BrainRegion>medial habenula</BrainRegion>, efferents composing the fasciculus retroflexus, and the <BrainRegion>interpeduncular nucleus</BrainRegion>; 2) nuclei and ascending tracts of the auditory system inclusive of the <BrainRegion>medial geniculate</BrainRegion>; 3) the <BrainRegion>sensory cortex barrel field</BrainRegion> and cell bodies of the <BrainRegion>ventral thalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>; 4) <BrainRegion>olfactory-associated structures</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>piriform cortex</BrainRegion>; and 5) <BrainRegion>sensory and motor trigeminal nuclei</BrainRegion>. In the <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion>, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor(nAChR) beta4 staining was limited to dendrites and soma of a subset of glutamic acid dehydrogenase-positive neurons. In C57BL/6 mice, but to a lesser extent in C3H/J, CBA/J, or CF1 mice, a subpopulation of astrocytes in the <BrainRegion>hippocampal CA1 region</BrainRegion> prominently expressed nicotinic acetylcholine receptor(nAChR) beta4 (and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor(nAChR) alpha4). Collectively, these results suggest that the unique functional and pharmacological properties exerted by nicotinic acetylcholine receptor(nAChR) beta4 on nicotinic acetylcholine receptor(nAChR) function could modify and specialize the development of strain-specific sensory and hippocampal-related characteristics of nicotine sensitivity including the development of tolerance.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Distribution of secretoneurin immunoreactivity in the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>lower brainstem</BrainRegion> in comparison with that of substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Secretoneurin is a peptide of 33 amino acids generated in brain by proteolytic processing of secretogranin II. The distribution of this newly characterized peptide was investigated by means of immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization in the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>lower brainstem</BrainRegion> of the rat. The staining pattern of secretoneurin immunoreactivity (IR) was compared to that of substance P (SP) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in adjacent sections. A high density of secretoneurin- immunoreactivity(IR) fibers and terminals was found in lamina I and outer lamina II of the <BrainRegion>caudal trigeminal nucleus</BrainRegion> and of the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> at all levels, around the <BrainRegion>central canal</BrainRegion>, and in the sympathetic and parasympathetic areas of the lateral cell columns. The <BrainRegion>ventral horn</BrainRegion> displayed a low to moderate density of secretoneurin- immunoreactivity(IR) . The highest number of secretogranin II mRNA-containing cells was found in lamina II of the <BrainRegion>dorsal horn</BrainRegion> and in neurons of the dorsal root ganglia. In the white matter, secretoneurin- immunoreactivity(IR) was most prominent in the dorsolateral part of the <BrainRegion>lateral funiculus</BrainRegion> and in the tract of Lissauer. The distributions of secretoneurin- immunoreactivity(IR) and substance P(SP) - immunoreactivity(IR) were strikingly similar. calcitonin gene-related peptide(CGRP) - immunoreactivity(IR) and secretoneurin- immunoreactivity(IR) overlapped in the outer laminae of the <BrainRegion>dorsal horn</BrainRegion>, in the lateral cell column, and probably in some motoneurons. This study establishes that, like substance P(SP) and calcitonin gene-related peptide(CGRP) , secretoneurin is a peptide highly concentrated in the terminal field of primary afferents and in sympathetic and parasympathetic areas. Thus secretoneurin might be involved in the modulation of afferent transmission.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Subventricular zone-olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> migratory pathway in the adult mouse: cellular composition and specificity as determined by heterochronic and heterotopic transplantation.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>To gain insight into cellular and molecular mechanisms subserving neuronal cell migration in the adult mouse <BrainRegion>forebrain</BrainRegion>, we have first investigated the cellular composition of the <BrainRegion>subventricular zone-olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> pathway (SVZ-OB). The pathway was essentially composed of cells with neuronal and astrocytic identities, neuronal cells being four times more numerous than astrocytes. Neuronal cells (precursors and some young postmitotic neurons) formed continuous cellular strands of migratory cells from the <BrainRegion>anterior horn of the lateral ventricle</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>. These chains of migrating cells moved within channels formed by the processes of a special subpopulation of astrocytes. The neuronal cells expressed the embryonic form of polysialic acid neural cell adhesion molecule, and the astrocytes were tenascin-C positive, thus preserving an embryonic cellular environment. Through transplantation experiments, the second part of this study attempted to analyze the functional properties of the adult <BrainRegion>subventricular zone-olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> pathway(SVZ-OB) pathway. Early postnatal (P2-13) <BrainRegion>cerebellar</BrainRegion> progenitor cells, taken from a transgenic mouse line in which <BrainRegion>cerebellar</BrainRegion> granule cells and molecular layer interneurons (basket/stellate cells) expressed the reporter gene lacZ, were implanted in the <BrainRegion>subventricular zone-olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> pathway(SVZ-OB) pathway of adult wild-type mice. Unlike grafted <BrainRegion>SVZ</BrainRegion> cells that migrate all along the pathway, none of the <BrainRegion>cerebellar</BrainRegion> precursors reached the <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>, although some of them were able to migrate along the caudal one-third of the pathway. The majority (over 67%) of the migrating cells were progenitors that acquired the phenotype of basket/stellate cells. Granule cell progenitors and most granule cells did not survive transplantation. These results show that the adult <BrainRegion>subventricular zone-olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> pathway(SVZ-OB) pathway is not a &quot;passive generic guidance" for all classes of premigratory neurons. From the two types of grafted <BrainRegion>cerebellar</BrainRegion> progenitors, only those with migratory capability and that do not follow radial glial axes are able to translocate along the <BrainRegion>subventricular zone-olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> pathway(SVZ-OB) pathway. Furthermore, the basket/stellate cell progenitors are specified at the time of grafting: Neither their identity nor the pace of expression of their major distinctive features are influenced by local signals emanating from the adult <BrainRegion>forebrain</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Transplantation of fetal <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> tissue into the chronically injured adult rat <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Transplants of fetal central nervous system (CNS) tissue into the acutely injured rat <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> have been demonstrated to differentiate and partially integrate with the adjacent host neuropil. In the present study, we examined the potential for applying a transplantation approach to chronic <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> lesions. In particular, we were interested in learning whether host-graft fusion would be adversely affected by an advanced histopathology characterized in part by glial scar formation. Hemisection cavities were prepared at lumbar levels of the adult rat <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> 2-7 weeks prior to the transplantation of <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> tissue obtained from 14-day rat fetuses. Graft survival, differentiation, and integration with the host <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> were subsequently evaluated by light microscopic techniques at post-transplantation intervals of 1-6 months. Immunocytochemistry was also employed to examine the extent of astrocytic scar formation at the host-graft interface and serotoninergic innervation of the grafts. In some other cases, anterograde and retrograde transport of wheat germ agglutinin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase was used to determine whether axonal projections were formed between the host <BrainRegion>spinal cords</BrainRegion> and grafts. By 2 weeks after injury the initial lesion cavities were surrounded by a continuous astrocytic scar which remained intact for at least 7 weeks after injury in nongrafted control animals. In other animals, transplantation into these advanced lesions resulted in well-differentiated grafts with a 90% long-term survival rate. Although dense gliosis was still present along the lesion surfaces of the recipient <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>, foci of confluent host-graft neuropil were observed where interruptions in the scar had occurred. Donor tissue integrated most often with the host <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> at interfaces with host gray matter; however, some implants also exhibited sites of fusion with damaged host white matter. Thus, some regions of confluent graft and host neuropil could be routinely identified, despite the presence of a dense glial scar along the walls of the chronic lesion site at the time of transplantation. Anterograde and retrograde tract-tracing results suggested that some axonal projections into these grafts had originated from host neurons located immediately adjacent to the donor-recipient interface. In addition, immunocytochemistry revealed some host serotoninergic axons (presumably of supraspinal origin) traversing nongliotic interfaces. The results of this study raise the possibility that grafted fetal central nervous system(CNS) tissue has a capacity for stimulating partial regression of an established glial scar.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Changes in subcellular localization of metabotropic glutamate receptor subtypes during postnatal development of mouse <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>High resolution immunoelectron microscopy was used to study subcellular localization patterns of three metabotropic glutamate receptor subtypes (mGluR1alpha, mGluR5, and mGluR2/3) during postnatal development of mouse <BrainRegion>ventral posterior (VP) thalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>. Immunoreactivity for all three mGluRs was detected from birth (postnatal day 0, P0), but mGluR1alpha showed dramatic changes in localization with age. In the first postnatal week, mGluR1alpha immunoreactivity was mainly found in proximal dendrites and somata and not usually associated with synaptic contacts. From the second postnatal week, it became concentrated in distal dendrites and preferentially associated with corticothalamic (RS) synapses. mGluR5 immunoreactivity was weaker than mGluR1alpha immunoreactivity at all postnatal ages and showed a similar change in subcellular distribution to that of mGluR1alpha. It was also localized in astrocytic processes. mGluR2/3 immunoreactivity was mainly localized in astrocytic processes surrounding neuronal somata and synapses and this pattern was consistently maintained through all postnatal ages. A small number of presynaptic axon terminals were labeled for mGluR2/3 immunoreactivity and formed asymmetrical synapses. This study demonstrates that Group I mGluR proteins (mGluR1alpha and mGluR5) become redistributed in association with the development of corticothalamic function as demonstrated physiologically, whereas Group II mGluR proteins (mGluR2/3) are mainly associated with neuroglia.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Organization of the efferent projections from the <BrainRegion>pontine parabrachial area</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>bed nucleus of the stria terminalis</BrainRegion> and neighboring regions: a PHA-L study in the rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The organization of efferent projections from the <BrainRegion>pontine parabrachial (pPB) area</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>forebrain rostral to the central nucleus of the amygdala</BrainRegion> (Ce) was studied in the rat by using microinjections of Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PHA-L), into subregions of the <BrainRegion>pontine parabrachial(pPB) area</BrainRegion>. The present study is a follow-up of a former study (Bernard et al. [1993] J. Comp. Neurol. 329:201-229) which examines <BrainRegion>pontine parabrachial</BrainRegion>(pPB) projections onto the <BrainRegion>Ce</BrainRegion>. The results demonstrate that: (1) the <BrainRegion>pontine parabrachial</BrainRegion>(pPB) (m) region (the <BrainRegion>medial, the ventral lateral subnuclei</BrainRegion> and the waist area) diffusely projects to the <BrainRegion>lateral division (BSTL) of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis</BrainRegion> ( <BrainRegion>bed nucleus of the stria terminalis</BrainRegion>(BST) ), the <BrainRegion>Ce- bed nucleus of the stria terminalis(BST) L continuum</BrainRegion> (including, the <BrainRegion>dorsal portion of substantia innominata</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>ventral portion of globus pallidus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>fundus striatum</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>substriatal area</BrainRegion>) and to a lesser extent the <BrainRegion>agranular insular cortex</BrainRegion>; (2) the <BrainRegion>pontine parabrachial</BrainRegion>(pPB) (1) region [the <BrainRegion>central lateral ( pontine parabrachial</BrainRegion>(pPB) cl) and the <BrainRegion>outer portion of external lateral subnuclei</BrainRegion>] densely projects to the <BrainRegion>dorsal lateral subnucleus of bed nucleus of the stria terminalis</BrainRegion>(BST) ( <BrainRegion>bed nucleus of the stria terminalis</BrainRegion>(BST) dl); only the <BrainRegion>pontine parabrachial(pPB) cl subnucleus</BrainRegion> projects to the <BrainRegion>median, the anteroventral and the periventricular nuclei of the preoptic hypothalamus</BrainRegion>; and (3) the remaining <BrainRegion>pontine parabrachial</BrainRegion>(pPB) area (the <BrainRegion>dorsal lateral, part of the external lateral and the external medial subnuclei</BrainRegion>) projects to the <BrainRegion>nucleus of horizontal limb of diagonal band</BrainRegion> but does not project onto the <BrainRegion>bed nucleus of the stria terminalis</BrainRegion>(BST) and the <BrainRegion>preoptic hypothalamus</BrainRegion>. It is suggested that the <BrainRegion>pontine parabrachial</BrainRegion>(pPB) (m)- <BrainRegion>bed nucleus of the stria terminalis</BrainRegion>(BST) L &quot;diffuse pathway" is mainly implicated in motivational and autonomic aspects of taste. The <BrainRegion>pontine parabrachial</BrainRegion>(pPB) (1)- <BrainRegion>bed nucleus of the stria terminalis</BrainRegion>(BST) dl and <BrainRegion>hypothalamic</BrainRegion> &quot;concentrated pathways" could be implicated in autonomic and nociceptive processes.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Retinal</BrainRegion> ganglion cell death during <BrainRegion>optic nerve</BrainRegion> regeneration in the frog Hyla moorei.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>In the frog Hyla moorei we have estimated there to be between approximately 450,000 and 750,000 cells in the <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> ganglion cell layer. Optic axon counts and retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) indicated that 72-76% of these were ganglion cells. Cells of this type were distributed as a temporally situated <BrainRegion>area centralis</BrainRegion> within a horizontal visual streak. Cell and optic axon counts showed that there was an approximately 40% loss of ganglion cells during <BrainRegion>optic nerve</BrainRegion> regeneration. Ganglion cells appeared chromatolysed by 6-8 days after an extracranial nerve crush but there was no indication of cell death until 15 days. By this stage anterograde transport of horseradish peroxidase(HRP) indicated that axons had reached the <BrainRegion>chiasma</BrainRegion>. Death was first seen in the <BrainRegion>area centralis</BrainRegion>, extended along the streak, and finally was observed in the periphery by 65 days; cell counts demonstrated that at this time the wave of death was almost complete. We have previously shown by electrophysiological visual mapping (Humphrey and Beazley, &apos;82) and confirmed in this study that visuotectal projections were retinotopically organized during regeneration. Multiunit receptive fields were initially large but progressively refined starting in nasal field (<BrainRegion>temporal retina</BrainRegion>) to restore a normal projection. The similar sequences whereby the visuotectal projection became refined and death took place in the <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> ganglion cell layer suggested that death may be related to a process of organization within the regenerating projection. In normal animals primary visual pathways revealed by anterograde transport of horseradish peroxidase(HRP) were essentially similar to those of Rana pipiens and R. esculenta. Regenerating axons generally remained within optic pathways. Exceptions were a retinoretinal projection which was not completely withdrawn even after 1,028 days and a direct projection to the ipsilateral tectum via an inappropriate part of the optic tract.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Increase in a focal population of juxtaglomerular cells in the <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> associated with early learning.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Young rats learn to approach an odor that had been experienced in the presence of reinforcing tactile stimulation. Subsequent presentation of the conditioned odor also evokes an enhanced focal uptake of 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) in the glomerular layer of the <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>, and the glomerular-layer width of such foci increases in conditioned pups. In the present study, we determined whether an increase in the glomerular-layer cell population contributes to this structural and functional change. We therefore counted and measured glomerular-layer cells in Nissl-stained sections from focal regions of radiolabeled 2-deoxyglucose(2-DG) uptake. While cell size did not differ between groups, conditioned pups had a 19% increase in the number of glomerular-layer cells associated with the 2-deoxyglucose(2-DG) foci compared to controls. The increase in cell number may contribute to the enhanced 2-deoxyglucose(2-DG) uptake in glomerular-layer foci.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Age-related change in the number of neurons in the human vestibular ganglion.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Dysequilibrium of aging in humans has been speculated to arise from progressive deterioration within anatomical components of the vestibular system. An integral part of this system is vestibular ganglions, which are bipolar neurons that relay peripheral vestibular information to the central nervous system. To assess the effect of aging on the number of human vestibular ganglion neurons, assumption-free stereology in the form of the optical fractionator was used on 20 serially sectioned archival human temporal bone specimens. Donors had no history of vestibular pathology and ranged in age from 2 to 88 years. An average of 25,812 (coefficient of variation = 0.13) vestibular ganglion neurons was found throughout this age range, a significant departure from the results of past studies. Logistics-based regression analysis pointed to a nonlinear pattern of decline in the neuronal population: the number of cells remained roughly constant at about 28,952 cells in youth and then declined gradually between 30 and 60 years of age before leveling off at approximately 23,349 cells in older individuals. This study confirmed the existence of an age-related decline in the primary neurons of the human vestibular system, thus providing one anatomical basis for the increased incidence of imbalance seen with age.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Distribution of type 1 cannabinoid receptor (CB1)-immunoreactive axons in the mouse <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Type 1 cannabinoid receptor (CB1) is the principal receptor for endocannabinoids in the brain; it mainly occurs in preterminal/terminal axons and mediates retrograde neuronal signaling mechanisms. A large body of physiological and electrophysiological evidence indicates the critical role of CB1 in the regulation of <BrainRegion>hypothalamic</BrainRegion> functions. Conversely, the distribution of CB1-containing axons in the <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion> is essentially unknown. Therefore, we have analyzed the distribution and the ultrastructural characteristics of the CB1-immunoreactive (IR) axons in the mouse <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion> by using an antiserum against the C-terminal 31 amino acids of the mouse CB1. We found that CB1- CB1-immunoreactive(IR) axons innervated densely the majority of <BrainRegion>hypothalamic nuclei</BrainRegion>, except for the <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic and lateral mammillary nuclei</BrainRegion>, in which only scattered CB1- CB1-immunoreactive(IR) fibers occurred. CB1- CB1-immunoreactive(IR) innervation of the <BrainRegion>arcuate, ventromedial, dorsomedial, and paraventricular nuclei</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>external zone of the median eminence</BrainRegion> corroborated the important role of CB1 in the regulation of energy homeostasis and neuroendocrine functions. Ultrastructural studies to characterize the phenotype of CB1- CB1-immunoreactive(IR) fibers established that most CB1 immunoreactivity appeared in the preterminal and terminal portions of axons. The CB1- CB1-immunoreactive(IR) boutons formed axospinous, axodendritic, and axosomatic synapses. Analysis of labeled synapses in the <BrainRegion>paraventricular and arcuate nuclei</BrainRegion> detected approximately equal numbers of symmetric and asymmetric specializations. In conclusion, the study revealed the dense and differential CB1- CB1-immunoreactive(IR) innervation of most <BrainRegion>hypothalamic nuclei</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>median eminence</BrainRegion> of the mouse brain. At the ultrastructural level, CB1- CB1-immunoreactive(IR) axons established communication with <BrainRegion>hypothalamic</BrainRegion> neurons via symmetric and asymmetric synapses indicating the occurrence of retrograde signaling by endocannabinoids in <BrainRegion>hypothalamic</BrainRegion> neuronal networks.

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Entorhinal cortex</BrainRegion> of the rat: organization of intrinsic connections.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Two sets of experiments were carried out to examine the organization of associational connections within the rat <BrainRegion>entorhinal cortex</BrainRegion>. First, a comprehensive analysis of the areal and laminar distribution of intrinsic projections was performed by using the anterograde tracers Phaseolus vulgaris-leuocoagglutinin (PHA-L) and biotinylated dextran amine (BDA). Second, retrograde tracers were injected into the <BrainRegion>dentate gyrus</BrainRegion> and Phaseolus vulgaris-leuocoagglutinin(PHA-L) and biotinylated dextran amine(BDA) were injected into the <BrainRegion>entorhinal cortex</BrainRegion> to determine the extent to which <BrainRegion>entorhinal</BrainRegion> neurons that project to different <BrainRegion>septotemporal levels of the dentate gyrus</BrainRegion> are linked by intrinsic connections. The regional distribution of intrinsic projections within the <BrainRegion>entorhinal cortex</BrainRegion> was related to the location of the cells of origin along the <BrainRegion>mediolateral axis of the entorhinal cortex</BrainRegion>. Cells located in the <BrainRegion>lateral regions of the entorhinal cortex</BrainRegion> gave rise to intrinsic connections that largely remained within the <BrainRegion>lateral reaches of the entorhinal cortex</BrainRegion>, i.e., within the <BrainRegion>rostrocaudally situated entorhinal band</BrainRegion> of cells that projected to <BrainRegion>septal levels of the dentate gyrus</BrainRegion>. Cells located in the <BrainRegion>medial regions of the entorhinal cortex</BrainRegion> gave rise to intrinsic projections confined to the <BrainRegion>medial portion of the entorhinal cortex</BrainRegion>. Injections made into <BrainRegion>mid-mediolateral regions of the entorhinal cortex</BrainRegion> mainly gave rise to projections to <BrainRegion>mid-mediolateral levels</BrainRegion>, although some fibers did enter either <BrainRegion>lateral or medial portions of the entorhinal cortex</BrainRegion>. These patterns were the same regardless of whether the projections originated from the superficial (II-III) or deep (V-VI) layers of the <BrainRegion>entorhinal cortex</BrainRegion>. This organizational scheme indicates, and our combined retrograde/anterograde labeling studies confirmed, that <BrainRegion>laterally situated entorhinal</BrainRegion> neurons that project to <BrainRegion>septal levels of the dentate gyrus</BrainRegion> are not in direct communication with neurons projecting to the <BrainRegion>temporal portions of the dentate gyrus</BrainRegion>. These results suggest that <BrainRegion>entorhinal</BrainRegion> intrinsic connections allow for both integration (within a band) and segregation (across bands) of <BrainRegion>entorhinal cortical</BrainRegion> information processing.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Direct catecholaminergic innervation of primate <BrainRegion>spinothalamic</BrainRegion> tract neurons.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Catecholaminergic axonal varicosities identified by immunocytochemical staining for dopamine-beta-hydroxylase were observed at the light microscopic level apposing the somata of retrogradely labeled <BrainRegion>spinothalamic</BrainRegion> tract neurons in the monkey <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>. Three retrogradely labeled and two intracellularly labeled <BrainRegion>spinothalamic</BrainRegion> neurons were serially sectioned and examined at selected intervals at the electron microscopic level. Electron microscopic study revealed that axonal boutons directly contacted the somata and/or dendrites of lamina I, IV, and V <BrainRegion>spinothalamic</BrainRegion> tract neurons. All of the profiles apposing one of the retrogradely labeled lamina I <BrainRegion>spinothalamic</BrainRegion> tract neurons were categorized from eight planes of section spaced at 1-micron intervals. Of the 305 profiles counted that were adjacent to this soma, 17 (5.6%) stained positively for dopamine-beta-hydroxylase. Of these 17 appositions, three were followed in serial sections to confirm that they had synaptic thickenings and alignment of vesicles along the membrane contacting the <BrainRegion>spinothalamic</BrainRegion> tract soma. Catecholaminergic boutons were observed apposing the somata and dendrites of intracellularly filled STT cells characterized as high threshold and wide dynamic range neurons. These observations clearly indicate a direct innervation of <BrainRegion>spinothalamic</BrainRegion> tract neurons by catecholaminergic neurons, providing anatomical data to support previous physiological findings demonstrating that catecholamines modulate nociceptive transmission.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Organization of histaminergic fibers in the rat brain.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Detailed information on innervation of the histaminergic system in the brain is essential to an understanding of the physiological roles of this system. In a previous immunocytochemical study with antihistidine decarboxylase (HDC) antibody, we detected extensive networks of histaminergic fibers in many areas of the rat brain (Watanabe et al., &apos;84). In the present study, we improved the immunocytochemical procedure and examined the detailed distribution of histaminergic innervation in the rat brain with anti-HDC antibody. As reported previously, the highest concentrations of fibers were found in the <BrainRegion>hypothalamic nuclei</BrainRegion> and medial forebrain bundle. With the modified procedure, we detected more dense networks of HDC-immunoreactive (HDCI) fibers. Furthermore, we demonstrated for the first time the existence of HDC-immunoreactive(HDCI) fibers in other regions, namely, the <BrainRegion>thalamic nuclei</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>median eminence</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>fimbria of the hippocampus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>habenular nuclei</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>nucleus of the optic tract</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>parabrachial nuclei</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>superior, lateral, and spinal vestibular nuclei</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>posterior lobe of the hypophysis</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>vascular organ of the lamina terminalis</BrainRegion>. We also found dense transverse fibers in the <BrainRegion>retrochiasmatic area</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>supraoptic decussation</BrainRegion>, which suggests bilateral innervation of the histaminergic system. These results indicate that innervation of the rat brain by the histaminergic system is more extensive than observed previously.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>The development of the <BrainRegion>septal region</BrainRegion> in the rat. II. Morphogenesis in normal and x-irradiated embryos.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Morphogenesis of the <BrainRegion>septal region</BrainRegion> was examined in normal rat embryos from embryonic day (E) 10 to E22. The greater part of the <BrainRegion>septal region</BrainRegion> is postulated to form from two separate anlagen which can be clearly distinguished in the <BrainRegion>telencephalon</BrainRegion> by E13 and E14. One lies in the anterior ventromedial wall and presumably forms the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the diagonal band</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>medial, lateral, and triangular septal nuclei</BrainRegion>. The other lies in the posterior ventrolateral ridge and presumably forms the <BrainRegion>bed nuclei of the stria terminalis</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>anterior commissure</BrainRegion>. On E15, the early differentiating cells in these anlagen fuse in the same region where the <BrainRegion>anterior commissure</BrainRegion> will cross on E17. With later embryonic development, differentiating cells of the <BrainRegion>strial bed nucleus accumulate</BrainRegion> rostral and caudal to the fused area. The same pattern is found in the <BrainRegion>medial and triangular septal nuclei</BrainRegion> and in the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the diagonal band</BrainRegion>. The differentiating cells of the <BrainRegion>lateral septal nucleus accumulate</BrainRegion> dorsal and lateral to <BrainRegion>medial and triangular septal nuclei</BrainRegion>. On E16 and E17, a prominent <BrainRegion>subependymal zone</BrainRegion> develops in the <BrainRegion>anterior septal region</BrainRegion> and presumably gives rise to the <BrainRegion>nucleus accumbens</BrainRegion>. A quantitative analysis was made of three cell zones (neuroepithelium, <BrainRegion>subependymal zone</BrainRegion>, differentiating cell zone) at coronal levels through the <BrainRegion>developing nucleus accumbens</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the diagonal band</BrainRegion> (anterior level) and the <BrainRegion>medial and lateral septal nuclei</BrainRegion> (middle and posterior levels). At all levels, the area of the neuroepithelium continually declines, that of the differentiating cell zone continually increases, and that of the <BrainRegion>subependymal zone</BrainRegion> shows a rise and decline. On a proportional basis, both the neuroepithelium and <BrainRegion>subependymal zone</BrainRegion> occupy significantly more area anteriorly than posteriorly, while the differentiating cell zone shows the reverse gradient. To accurately locate regions of primitive mitotic and migratory cells within the zones at each level, the number of cells surviving a single exposure to 200 R X-rays in embryonic brains (E15-E22) were compared with controls. Each zone responded differently to X-ray insult. The radiosensitivity of the neuroepithelium decreases significantly after E19; the <BrainRegion>subependymal zone</BrainRegion> is highly radiosensitive throughout; the differentiating cell zone is radioresistant throughout. The significance of these findings is discussed in the light of the autoradiographic determination of the time of formation of <BrainRegion>septal</BrainRegion> neurons (Bayer, &apos;79).</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Kainate-activated cobalt uptake in the <BrainRegion>primary gustatory nucleus</BrainRegion> in goldfish: visualization of the morphology and distribution of cells expressing AMPA/kainate receptors in the <BrainRegion>vagal lobe</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Gustatory afferent fibers of the vagus nerve that innervate taste buds of the oropharynx of the goldfish, Carassius auratus, project to the <BrainRegion>vagal lobe</BrainRegion>, which is a laminated <BrainRegion>gustatory nucleus in the dorsal medulla</BrainRegion>. As in the mammalian gustatory system, responses by second-order cells in the goldfish <BrainRegion>medulla</BrainRegion> are mediated by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and non- N-methyl-D-aspartate(NMDA) ionotropic glutamate receptors. We utilized a cobalt uptake technique to label <BrainRegion>vagal lobe</BrainRegion> neurons that possess cobalt-permeable ionotropic glutamate receptors. <BrainRegion>Vagal lobe</BrainRegion> slices were bathed in kainate (40 microM) or glutamate (0.5 or 1 mM) in the presence of CoCl(2), which can pass into cells through the ligand-gated cation channels of non- N-methyl-D-aspartate(NMDA) receptors made up of certain subunit combinations. Cobalt-filled cells and dendrites were observed in slices that were activated by kainate or glutamate, but not in control slices that were bathed in CoCl(2) alone, nor in slices that were bathed with the non- N-methyl-D-aspartate(NMDA) receptor antagonist 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (10 microM) in addition to an agonist. Likewise, simple depolarization of the cells with KCl failed to induce cobalt loading. Cobalt-filled round unipolar cells, elongate or globular bipolar cells, and multipolar cells with elongate or polygonal perikarya were distributed throughout the cell layers in the <BrainRegion>sensory zone of the vagal lobe</BrainRegion>. Numerous labeled neurons had dendrites spanning layers IV and VI, the two principal layers of primary afferent input. Apical and basal dendrites often extended radially through neighboring laminae, but many cells also extended dendrites tangential to the lamination of the sensory zone. In the motor layer, cell bodies and proximal dendrites of small, multipolar neurons, and large motoneurons were regularly loaded with cobalt.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Tectal</BrainRegion> projections of an infrared sensitive snake, Crotalus viridis.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Crotaline snakes have detectors for infrared radiation and this information is projected to the <BrainRegion>optic tectum</BrainRegion> in a spatiotopic manner. The <BrainRegion>tectal</BrainRegion> projections were examined in Crotalus viridis with the use of silver methods for degenerating fibers and the autoradiographic and horseradish peroxidase tracing methods. Large lesions included all of the <BrainRegion>tectal</BrainRegion> layers but not the underlying structures. Projections to the <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion> include a sparse input to the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral ventral and dorsal lateral geniculate nuclei</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>ventromedial nucleus</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>nucleus lentiformis thalami</BrainRegion>. <BrainRegion>Nucleus rotundus</BrainRegion> was not detected. The projections to the <BrainRegion>pretectal nuclei</BrainRegion> are primarily <BrainRegion>ipsilateral to the nucleus lentiformis mesencephali</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>pretectal nucleus</BrainRegion>. At the level of the <BrainRegion>mesencephalon</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>tectal</BrainRegion> efferents are <BrainRegion>bilateral to nucleus profundus mesencephali</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>tegmentum</BrainRegion>. There is minimal input to the contralateral deep <BrainRegion>tectal</BrainRegion> layers. There are ipsilateral terminations in a nucleus identified as the <BrainRegion>posterolateral tegmental nucleus</BrainRegion>. Descending fibers include the two major tracts--the ventral tectobulbar tract that terminates in the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral lateral reticular formation</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>predorsal bundle</BrainRegion> that distributes throughout the <BrainRegion>contralateral medial reticular formation</BrainRegion>. Two small descending tracts were noted--the intermediate and dorsal tectobulbar tracts. All of these descending tracts appear to terminate by the time they reach the <BrainRegion>caudal medulla</BrainRegion>. After superficial lesions terminals could be found in the <BrainRegion>ventral lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>nucleus profundus mesencephali</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>posterolateral tegmental nucleus</BrainRegion>; the two major descending tracts contained degenerated fibers as well. The areas receiving <BrainRegion>tectal</BrainRegion> input in Crotalus were compared to those of other reptiles and discussed.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Development of the human <BrainRegion>motor-related thalamic nuclei</BrainRegion> during the first half of gestation, with special emphasis on GABAergic circuits.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>This study analyzed the expression of differentiation markers (Calbindin D28K: CaBP; parvalbumin: PARV; calretinin: CalR), gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) markers ( gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) , glutamic acid decarboxylases: GAD65, GAD67; and gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) transporters: GAT1, GAT3), and other markers (neurotensin: NT, and neurofilament-specific protein: SMI32) in the <BrainRegion>human thalamus</BrainRegion> at 8-23 gestation weeks (g.w.), focusing on the <BrainRegion>motor-related nuclei</BrainRegion>. From 8-13 gestation weeks(g.w.) mainly CaBP was expressed in the cells while fiber bundles traversing the <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion> in addition to CaBP expressed all gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) markers except GAD67. CaBP and PARV expression patterns in different nuclei changed over the time course studied, whereas NT was expressed consistently along the <BrainRegion>anterior-lateral curvature of the thalamus</BrainRegion>. CalR and SMI were detectable at 23 gestation weeks(g.w.) in the <BrainRegion>ventral parts of the dorsal thalamus</BrainRegion>. Most remarkably, punctate GAD65 immunoreactivity in the neuropil was confined to the <BrainRegion>nigro- and pallidothalamic afferent receiving nuclei</BrainRegion> from 16 to about 21 gestation weeks(g.w.) , overlappin gestation weeks(g.w.) th that of CaBP in some of these nuclei (<BrainRegion>subdivisions of the ventral anterior and mediodorsal nuclei</BrainRegion>) and with PARV in others (<BrainRegion>centromedian nucleus</BrainRegion>). During this period, GAD65 immunoreactivity can be considered a marker of the <BrainRegion>basal ganglia</BrainRegion> afferent receiving territory in the <BrainRegion>motor thalamus</BrainRegion>. GAD67-positive local circuit neurons were first detected at 12-13 gestation weeks(g.w.) in the <BrainRegion>thalamic nuclei</BrainRegion> outside the <BrainRegion>basal ganglia</BrainRegion> afferent receiving territory. In the <BrainRegion>ventral anterior and centromedian nuclei</BrainRegion>, GAD-containing local circuit neurons were not conspicuous even at 22-23 gestation weeks(g.w.) The cells of the <BrainRegion>reticular nucleus</BrainRegion> expressed GAD67 and PARV from 12 gestation weeks(g.w.) on starting in the lateral-posterior regions. By 23 gestation weeks(g.w.) , both markers were expressed in about two-thirds of the nucleus except for its most medial-anterior part. The results imply spatially and temporally differential expression of gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) and differentiation markers in the developing human <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Neurogenesis and gliogenesis in the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> of turtles.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>A 5-bromo-3&apos;-deoxyuridine (BrdU) pulse administered to juvenile turtles resulted in cell labeling throughout the gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) of the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>. One and twenty-four hours postinjection, larger densities of 5-bromo-3&apos;-deoxyuridine(BrdU) -labeled nuclei (LN) occurred within the gray matter(GM) , with a density peak localized in the central region (CR). Seven days later, density differences between gray matter(GM) and white matter(WM) disappeared, accompanying a more uniform distribution of BrdU-labeled nuclei(LN) in the gray matter(GM) (absence of the central peak). Multiple injection experiments also showed similar evolution in the distribution of BrdU-labeled nuclei(LN) . Morphometric studies revealed that the size of BrdU-labeled nuclei(LN) had undergone time-related increments: Larger nuclei appeared at protracted fixation time points. Double-labeling experiments indicated that 5-bromo-3'-deoxyuridine(BrdU) -labeled cells expressed neuroactive substances, such as gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), neuron-specific nuclear protein (NeuN), and the cytoplasmic early postmitotic neuronal marker (TUC-4). Other 5-bromo-3'-deoxyuridine(BrdU) -labeled cells expressed the glial-specific protein (GFAP). gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) - 5-bromo-3'-deoxyuridine(BrdU) , TUC-4- 5-bromo-3'-deoxyuridine(BrdU) , and GFAP- 5-bromo-3'-deoxyuridine(BrdU) double-labeled cells were recognized 6 days after the first 5-bromo-3'-deoxyuridine(BrdU) injection. neuron-specific nuclear protein(NeuN) - 5-bromo-3'-deoxyuridine(BrdU) double-labeled cells were found at 50 days postinjection. Three-dimensional transmission electron microscopy revealed the presence of synapses and typical kinocilia in putative immature nerve cells. Kinocilia were also found in putative immature glial cells. In consideration of the scattered distribution pattern of 5-bromo-3'-deoxyuridine(BrdU) -labeled cells, in animals fixed 1 hour postinjection, the existence of a single proliferating center was discarded. The central region(CR) , including the ependymal epithelium, showed the highest density of BrdU-labeled nuclei(LN) .</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Nonintegrin laminin receptor precursor protein is expressed on olfactory stem and progenitor cells.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The biochemical identification and immunocytochemical characterization of a cell surface antigen, expressed on globose basal cells (GBCs) of the rodent <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> epithelium (OE), are described. The monoclonal antibody (MAb) GBC-3 recognizes a surface protein, confirmed by both live cell staining and fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Two-dimensional SDS-PAGE/Western blot followed by tandem mass spectrometry demonstrates that the cell surface GBC-3 antigen is the 40 kDa laminin receptor precursor protein. The monoclonal antibody(MAb) GBC-3 labels the vast majority of cells among the GBC population and does not stain either sustentacular cells or horizontal basal cells (HBCs) in the normal rat <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> epithelium(OE) . After epithelial lesion by exposure to methyl bromide, the remaining cells, which are mostly globose basal cells(GBCs) , are heavily stained by GBC-3, and colabeled with GBC-3 and sustentacular cell or HBC markers. GBC-3 will be a potentially useful tool for identifying and characterizing globose basal cells(GBCs) .</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Morphology and somatotopic organisation of the central projections of afferents from tactile hairs on the hind leg of the locust.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The morphology and organisation of the central projections of tactile hair afferents from the hind leg of the locust, Schistocerca gregaria, were examined by staining individual hair afferents. Each tactile hair on the femur, tibia, and tarsus is innervated by a single sensory afferent, which projects to the ipsilateral half of the metathoracic ganglion. Afferents arborize in the ventralmost and lateral ventral association centres (vVAC and lVAC). The projections are organised somatotopically in a map with three axes, according to the position of the hair on the leg. First, proximo-distal: afferents from hairs on the proximal leg segments project more anteriorly than do those from hairs on distal leg segments. Moreover, on any given segment the afferents from the more proximal hairs project more anteriorly than do the afferents from the distal hairs. Second, antero-posterior: afferents from hairs on the posterior surface of the leg project more medially than do afferents from anterior hairs. Third, dorso-ventral: afferents from hairs on ventral parts of the leg project more ventrally than do afferents from the dorsal hairs. The afferents from posterior and anterior hairs project to an area between the central projections from dorsal hairs and ventral hairs. The position of a projection within the map is dependent upon the location of the hair on the leg and not the peripheral routes taken by the axon of its afferent to reach the ganglion.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Convergence and divergence in the afferent projections to cat <BrainRegion>area 17</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>We have examined the topography of the afferent connections to <BrainRegion>area 17</BrainRegion> in the cat by means of double retrograde label tracing techniques. Injections of two fluorescent retrograde tracers, diamidino yellow and fast blue, were made with variable separations in <BrainRegion>area 17</BrainRegion> and the spatial distributions of the resulting populations of labeled cells examined in afferent <BrainRegion>cortical areas</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>subcortical structures</BrainRegion>. When injections were separated rostrocaudally, the topographic organizations of the projections were characterized quantitatively with two graphic methods: the labeling density curve and the connectivity graph. The labeling density curve measures labeled neuron density in successive rostrocaudal sections, whereas the connectivity graph provides a two-dimensional model of the topography of a given connectivity. The connectivity graph makes it possible to define two parameters that characterize the topography of the connection: the convergence and the divergence. The convergence is defined as the extent of an afferent structure that contains neurons converging on a line normal to the <BrainRegion>cortical surface</BrainRegion> in <BrainRegion>area 17</BrainRegion>. The divergence is the extent of <BrainRegion>area 17</BrainRegion> that is innervated by neurons contained in an infinitely small region of the afferent structure. The results show that a number of <BrainRegion>subcortical structures</BrainRegion> project to <BrainRegion>area 17</BrainRegion> in a nontopographic manner, i.e., that in each of these structures neurons contained in an infinitely small region send projections to the whole of <BrainRegion>area 17</BrainRegion> and that a line normal to the surface of <BrainRegion>area 17</BrainRegion> is innervated by neurons distributed throughout the afferent structure in question. Nontopographic projections are found from the <BrainRegion>intralaminar nuclei</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>ventral mesencephalic tegmental region</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>diagonal band of Broca</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>locus coeruleus</BrainRegion>. All remaining <BrainRegion>subcortical structures</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>cortical areas</BrainRegion> send topographically organized projections to <BrainRegion>area 17</BrainRegion>. The extent of the convergence and divergence, however, varies between structures. Only the projection from the A laminae of the LGN was found to approximate a point-to-point projection with a convergence of 0.4 mm and 2 mm in divergence. Much larger convergence and divergence values are found in the projections from the <BrainRegion>claustrum</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>cortical areas</BrainRegion>. For example, the divergence reaches 20 mm for the projections from <BrainRegion>area 20</BrainRegion> or from the <BrainRegion>anterior part of the lateral suprasylvian sulcus</BrainRegion>. Knowing the convergence and divergence values and the retinotopic organizations of <BrainRegion>area 17</BrainRegion> and a number of its afferents, it becomes possible to test whether connections in the visual system link regions representing the same zone of the visual field.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Taste pathways to <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>amygdala</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The projections of a third order gustatory relay in the <BrainRegion>dorsal pons</BrainRegion> of rats have been traced using tritiated proline autoradiography and antidromic activation of <BrainRegion>pontine</BrainRegion> neurons from electrodes in the <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>amygdala</BrainRegion>. Labelled axons collect in the central tegmental tract and ascend to the <BrainRegion>thalamic taste area</BrainRegion> in the <BrainRegion>medial extension of the ventrobasal complex</BrainRegion>. The majority of the fibers remain ipsilateral, but a few cross in the <BrainRegion>rostral pons</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>midbrain</BrainRegion>. The largest crossing occurs at the level of the <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> termination. Many fascicles of fibers continue rostrally by passing beneath the <BrainRegion>thalamic taste area</BrainRegion>, piercing the <BrainRegion>medial lemniscus</BrainRegion>, and spreading out along the <BrainRegion>dorsomedial corner of the internal capsule</BrainRegion> (IC). The terminal field at this level caps <BrainRegion>internal capsule</BrainRegion>(IC) from the <BrainRegion>subthalamic nucleus</BrainRegion> down into the <BrainRegion>far-lateral hypothalamus</BrainRegion>. Labelled axons grandually penetrate through the <BrainRegion>internal capsule</BrainRegion>, and ramify throughout the underlying <BrainRegion>substantia innominata</BrainRegion>. This terminal zone extends laterally into the <BrainRegion>rostral end of the central nucleus of the amygdala</BrainRegion>, which is densely labelled to its caudal exremity. At the <BrainRegion>caudal end of the amygdala</BrainRegion> labelled fibers are visible in one component of the <BrainRegion>stria terminalis</BrainRegion>. These fibers can be followed over the <BrainRegion>dorsal thalamus</BrainRegion> into a smaller, but equally dense terminal area in the <BrainRegion>dorsolateral bed nucleus of the stria terminalis</BrainRegion>. The electrophysiological data demonstrate that <BrainRegion>pontine</BrainRegion> gustatory units can be antidromically activated by electrodes located in or near the <BrainRegion>central nucleus of the amygdala</BrainRegion>. Since many of the same units can also be driven from the <BrainRegion>thalamic taste area</BrainRegion>, at least some of the axons traced autoradiographically probably convey gustatory information to the <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>amygdala</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Plasticity of <BrainRegion>auditory cortex</BrainRegion> associated with sensorineural hearing loss in adult C57BL/6J mice.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The representation of frequency was mapped in the <BrainRegion>primary auditory cortex</BrainRegion> (AI) of C57BL/6J ( C57BL/6J(C57) ) mice during young adulthood (1.5-2 months) when hearing is optimal, and at 3, 6, and 12 months of age, a period during which progressive, high frequency, sensorineural hearing loss occurs in this strain. Maps were also obtained from CBA/CaJ mice which retain good hearing as they age. In auditory cortex(<BrainRegion>AI</BrainRegion>) of young adult C57BL/6J(C57) mice and CBA mice, characteristic frequencies (CFs) of multiple-unit clusters were easily identified with extracellular recordings, and a general tonotopic organization was observed from dorsal (high frequency) to ventral and caudal (low frequency). In individual cases there appeared to be deviations from the above tonotopic organization, despite the fact that inbred mice are genetically invariant. As progressive loss of high frequency sensitivity ensued peripherally, a substantially increased representation of middle frequencies was observed in auditory cortex(<BrainRegion>AI</BrainRegion>) . There was no apparent change in the surface area of the <BrainRegion>auditory cortex</BrainRegion> despite the elimination of high frequencies, and virtually the entire <BrainRegion>auditory cortex</BrainRegion> became devoted to the middle frequencies (especially 10-13 kHz) for which sensitivity remained high. Similar age-related changes were not observed in normal-hearing CBA mice. These findings indicate that plasticity in the representation of frequency in auditory cortex(<BrainRegion>AI</BrainRegion>) is associated with high frequency hearing loss in C57BL/6J(C57) mice.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>The inner ear macular sensory epithelia of the Daubenton&apos;s bat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The inner ear macular sensory epithelia of the Daubenton&apos;s bat were examined quantitatively to estimate the area and total number of hair cells. Ultrastructural examination of the sensory epithelium reveals two main types of hair cells: the chalice-innervated hair cell and the bouton-innervated hair cell. The existence of an intermediate type, with a nerve ending covering the lateral side of the hair cell, indicates that the chalice-innervated hair cells are derived from bouton-innervated hair cells. Thus, at least a part of the bouton-innervated hair cells forms a transitional stage. A number of immature as well as apoptotic hair cells were observed. It is suggested that a continuous production of new hair cells takes place in mature individuals, probably based on transdifferentiation of supporting cells.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Postnatal development of neurons containing choline acetyltransferase in rat <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>: an immunocytochemical study.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>A monoclonal antibody to choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) has been used in an immunocytochemical study of the postnatal development of choline acetyltransferase(ChAT) -containing neurons in <BrainRegion>cervical and thoracic spinal cord</BrainRegion>. Specimens from rat pups ranging in age from 1 to 28 days postnatal (dpn) were studied and compared with adult specimens (Barber et al., &apos;84). The development of established cholinergic neurons, the somatic motoneurons and sympathetic preganglionic cells, has been described as has that of previously unidentified choline acetyltransferase(ChAT) -positive neurons in the dorsal, intermediate, and central gray matter. Cell bodies of somatic and visceral motoneurons contained moderate amounts of choline acetyltransferase(ChAT) -positive reaction product at birth that gradually increased in intensity until 14-21 days postnatal(dpn) . The most intensely stained choline acetyltransferase(ChAT) -positive neurons in 1-5- days postnatal(dpn) specimens were named partition cells because this cell group extended from the central gray to an area dorsal to the lateral motoneurons, and thereby divided the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> into dorsal and ventral halves. Partition cells were medium to large in size with 5-7 primary dendrites, and axons that, in fortuitous sections, could be traced into the ventrolateral motoneuron pools, the <BrainRegion>ventral funiculi</BrainRegion>, or the <BrainRegion>ventral commissure</BrainRegion>. Small choline acetyltransferase(ChAT) -positive cells clustered around the <BrainRegion>central canal</BrainRegion> and scattered in laminae III-VI of the <BrainRegion>dorsal horn</BrainRegion> were detectable at birth. These neurons were moderately immunoreactive at 11-14 days postnatal(dpn) and intensely choline acetyltransferase(ChAT) positive by 21 days postnatal(dpn) . The band of choline acetyltransferase(ChAT) -positive terminal-like structures demonstrated in lamina III of adult specimens (Barber et al., &apos;84) was first visible in 11-14- days postnatal(dpn) specimens. By 28 days postnatal(dpn) , both laminae I and III contained punctate bands that approximated the density of those observed in adult <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>. This investigation has demonstrated choline acetyltransferase(ChAT) within individual neurons of developing <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>, and has identified a group of neurons, the partition cells, that exhibit intense choline acetyltransferase(ChAT) -positive immunoreactivity earlier than any other putative cholinergic cells in <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>, including motoneurons. Another important observation has been that each choline acetyltransferase(ChAT) -positive neuronal type achieves adult levels of staining intensity at different times during development. A likely explanation for this differential staining is that various groups of neurons acquire their mature concentration of choline acetyltransferase(ChAT) molecules at different developmental stages. In turn, this may correlate with the maturation of cholinergic synaptic activity manifest by individual cells or groups of neurons.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Motor neurons supplying hindwing muscles of a grasshopper: topography and distribution into anatomical groups.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The motor neurons supplying the dorsoventral wing muscles in the metathorax of the grasshopper Schistocerca americana were stained by backfilling muscle-nerves with cobaltous chloride, which was then precipitated and intensified as silver sulfide. Stained motor neurons were examined in wholemounts and in sectioned ganglia. Two unifunctional muscles are innervated by a single motor neuron each, whereas four bifunctional muscles, involved in leg and wing movements, are innervated by two or three motor neurons each. Each of the motor neurons is in one of four identified anatomical groups. All members of a group have primary neurites that enter the ganglion core as part of an anatomically defined bundle and have cell bodies that lie near each other in the <BrainRegion>ganglion cortex</BrainRegion> (Siegler and Pousman, J Comp Neurol: 297:298, 1990). The morphology of the neuropilar branches of the motor neurons is correlated with the pairwise topographic arrangement of the target muscles rather than the muscles&apos; functions. Thus, motor neurons that innervate antagonistic pairs of muscles may be more similar in morphology than motor neurons that innervate synergistic muscles. We find no evidence that particular main branches of the different motor neurons are uniquely associated with a particular motor function. Significant differences in the nature and distribution of synaptic inputs to motor neurons of different function would necessarily be expected as a basis for known differences in synaptic connectivity, but may not be apparent at the level of resolution available from light microscope examination.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Efferent connections of the <BrainRegion>caudate nucleus</BrainRegion> in the Virginia opossum.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The efferents of the opossum&apos;s <BrainRegion>caudate nucleus</BrainRegion> were investigated by charting the the fiber degenerations produced by electrolytic lesions in various parts of this nucleus. By the aid of a modified Fink-Heimer procedure, degenerating fibers were traced from each of the lesions to the small <BrainRegion>globus pallidus</BrainRegion> in which they appeared to be distributed in an orderly dorsoventral pattern. Fibers from all lesion sites in the <BrainRegion>caudate nucleus</BrainRegion> were found to terminate in the <BrainRegion>entopedunucular nucleus</BrainRegion>. In the <BrainRegion>substantia nigra</BrainRegion>, caudatofugal-fiber degeneration was confined in all cases to the <BrainRegion>rostal part of the pars reticulata</BrainRegion>, and was densest in the medial one-half of this nucleus. Only from lesions in the <BrainRegion>ventromedial part of the caudate nucleus</BrainRegion> could degenerating fibers be traced to the <BrainRegion>nucleus ansae lenticularis</BrainRegion>. No fiber degeneration could be traced rostrally from the lesions, or to the <BrainRegion>putamen</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>red nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>subthalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>, or <BrainRegion>pons</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Choline acetyltransferase immunoreactivity in the developing brain of Xenopus laevis.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The spatiotemporal sequence of the appearance of cholinergic structures in the brain of Xenopus laevis during development was studied by means of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) immunohistochemistry. The first choline acetyltransferase(ChAT) labeling in the central nervous system of Xenopus was obtained at late embryonic stages in the <BrainRegion>spinal</BrainRegion> motoneurons, the <BrainRegion>cranial nerve motor nuclei</BrainRegion> of the <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion>, and in amacrine cells of the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>. During premetamorphosis, these cholinergic structures maturated significantly and new choline acetyltransferase(ChAT) -immunoreactive cells were observed in several other nuclei such as the <BrainRegion>solitary tract nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>isthmic nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>laterodorsal and pedunculopontine tegmental nuclei</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>epiphysis</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>dorsal habenular nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>medial amygdala</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>bed nucleus of the stria terminalis</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>dorsal pallidum</BrainRegion>. Further maturation continued through prometamorphosis and the climax of the metamorphosis together with the appearance of new cell groups in the <BrainRegion>efferent octaval nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>ventral hypothalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>anterior preoptic area</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>medial septum</BrainRegion>. Transient expression of choline acetyltransferase(ChAT) was only seen in the large Mauthner cells that showed moderate choline acetyltransferase(ChAT) labeling during pre- and prometamorphosis but became immunonegative at the end of the metamorphosis. The gradual appearance, in general from caudal to rostral brain levels, of choline acetyltransferase(ChAT) immunoreactivity in Xenopus, was correlated with other developmental events to get insight into the possible roles of acetylcholine during ontogeny. Comparison with the developmental pattern of cholinergic systems in other vertebrates shows that Xenopus possesses abundant features in common with amniotes, suggesting a conservative developmental plan for tetrapods.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Neurogenesis in the 3-month-old rat <BrainRegion>visual cortex</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Newly formed neurons in the adult mammalian <BrainRegion>neocortex</BrainRegion> have been reported by several investigators using light microscopic radioautography, but these reports have not been confirmed by electron microscopy--probably because their rarity precludes any reasonable chance of observing these cells with electron microscopic radioautography. To overcome this problem I have used a recently developed method that allows serial thin sectioning and subsequent electron microscopic examination of plastic-embedded sections previously prepared for light microscopic radioautography. Ninety-day-old rats were injected with 4.3 microCi per gm body weight of [H3] thymidine and allowed to survive for 30 days. In the light radioautographs, labeled cells were found in layer IV of the <BrainRegion>visual cortex</BrainRegion>, and analysis of electron micrographs of selected examples of these labeled cells clearly demonstrated their neuronal nature wit synapses along their cell bodies and dendrites. In order to quantify the relative frequency of labeled neurons, the number of labeled cells seen in the light microscopic sections was expressed as a percentage of the total number of neurons found in sections through the entire thickness of the <BrainRegion>visual cortex</BrainRegion>; the percentage was 0.011%, or about 1 in 10,000. The results of this study are in agreement with evidence of neurogenesis of granular neurons in the adult rat <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>dentate gyrus</BrainRegion> (Kaplan and Hinds, &apos;77). Thus, it has now been confirmed that relatively small labeled neurons and their synapses are found in at least 3 brain regions (<BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>dentate gyrus</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>visual cortex</BrainRegion>) in a normal adult rodent.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Afferent and sympathetic neurons projecting into lumbar visceral nerves of the male rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The cell bodies of thoracolumbar sensory and sympathetic pre- and postganglionic neurons that project to the colon and pelvic organs of the male rat were labeled retrogradely with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) in order to study numbers, segmental distribution, and location of the somata of these neurons quantitatively. horseradish peroxidase(HRP) was applied to one hypogastric nerve (HGN), to the lumbar colonic nerves (LCN) and to the intermesenteric nerve (IMN). In order to estimate the significance of the branching of one axon into both hypogastric nerves a double-labeling technique with fluorogold and horseradish peroxidase(HRP) was used. About 2640 neurons project into the two hypogastric nerve(HGN) added together (800 afferent, 1320 pre-, and 520 postganglionic), 4650 neurons into the lumbar colonic nerves(LCN) (360 afferent, 0 pre- and 4290 postganglionic), and 5990 into the intermesenteric nerve(IMN) (1500 afferent, 1250 pre-, and 3240 postganglionic). About 4190 sympathetic postganglionic prevertebral neurons innervate the colon and pelvic organs, 1900 are located in the inferior mesenteric ganglion and 2290 in ganglia of the intermesenteric nerve(IMN) . Considering the efferent component, the hypogastric nerve(HGN) mainly are preganglionic and the lumbar colonic nerves(LCN) exclusively postganglionic nerves. Branching of one axon into both hypogastric nerve(HGN) is a rare event and quantitatively negligible (less than 3%). Afferent neurons of all three nerves were found in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) T12-L2 with the maximum in L1 and L2. The distribution of afferent neurons projecting into the lumbar colonic nerves(LCN) is shifted slightly more rostrally compared to neurons projecting into the hypogastric nerve(HGN) . The intermesenteric nerve(IMN) distribution is located in a position in between. Preganglionic neurons projecting into the intermesenteric nerve(IMN) are located in the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> segments T12-L3 with the maximum in L1 and L2.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Pallidal afferent territory of the Macaca mulatta <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion>: neuronal and synaptic organization of the VAdc.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText><BrainRegion>Ventral anterior thalamic nucleus pars densicellularis</BrainRegion> (VAdc) as delineated earlier (Ilinsky and Kultas-Ilinsky [1987] J. Comp. Neurol. 262:331-364) was analyzed by using qualitative and quantitative neuroanatomical techniques. Projection neurons (PN), retrogradely labeled with wheat germ agglutinin conjugated horseradish peroxidase from the <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion>, were small to medium in size (mean area, 312 microm2) with numerous primary dendrites displaying a tufted branching pattern. Local circuit neurons (LCN), immunoreactive for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamic acid decarboxylase, were small (mean area, 110 microm2), and gave off few dendrites. Two subpopulations of gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) positive boutons (F1 type) were distinguished: large (mean area, 2.6 microm2) terminals with symmetric synapses containing few pleomorphic vesicles and numerous mitochondria densely covered proximal Projection neurons(PN) sites; smaller F1 boutons with a slightly different morphology contacted mostly distal Projection neurons(PN) dendrites. Two subpopulations of terminals containing round vesicles and forming asymmetric synapses were distinguished by bouton size (mean areas, 0.4 microm2 and 1.6 microm2, respectively). These targeted mainly distal Projection neurons(PN) dendrites, but some synapsed proximally next to large F1 boutons. On distal dendrites, representatives of both types were labeled from the <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion>. The density of boutons with symmetric and asymmetric synapses (the number of boutons per 100 microm of Projection neurons(PN) membrane length) was 3.3:0.2 on primary, 2.5:1.2 on secondary, and 0.8:12 on distal dendrites. The numerical density of synapses formed by presynaptic Local circuit neurons(LCN) dendrites on all Projection neurons(PN) levels was 20 to 40 times less than that of axon terminals at the same sites. Afferent input to Local circuit neurons(LCN) from boutons of all types, including that from 50% of labeled <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> boutons, mainly targeted distal dendrites. Overall, the findings suggest that Projection neurons(PN) in <BrainRegion>Ventral anterior thalamic nucleus pars densicellularis</BrainRegion>(VAdc) receive massive inhibitory input proximally intermingled with some presumably excitatory input, and that Local circuit neurons(LCN) contribution to Projection neurons(PN) inhibition is modest.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Substance P-like and serotonin-like immunoreactivity in the <BrainRegion>lateral cervical nucleus</BrainRegion> of the raccoon.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The distribution of substance P and serotonin in the lateral cervical nucleus (LCN) of the raccoon was examined by light microscopic immunohistochemistry. Substance P-immunoreactive fibers were found to be clustered in the <BrainRegion>ventromedial part of the lateral cervical nucleus</BrainRegion>(LCN) , whereas only few such fibers appeared in the dorsolateral part of the nucleus. This organization is closely similar to that previously observed in the cat, and provides further evidence for an anatomic and functional segregation along the transverse axis of the <BrainRegion>lateral cervical nucleus</BrainRegion>(LCN) in carnivores. In some sections, substance P-positive fibers were found primarily in areas of the <BrainRegion>ventromedial lateral cervical nucleus</BrainRegion>(LCN) containing small neurons, indicating that such fibers may be involved in functions of the <BrainRegion>lateral cervical nucleus</BrainRegion>(LCN) associated with nociceptive projection neurons and/or local circuit neurons. The raccoon <BrainRegion>lateral cervical nucleus</BrainRegion>(LCN) also received a relatively sparse innervation of serotonin-positive fibers that were distributed throughout the nucleus, an organization similar to that previously observed in the cat. The functional role of the serotonergic fibers is unclear. However, their presence suggests that descending influences on transmission in the spinocervicothalamic pathway, in addition to the well-documented descending control of spinocervical tract neurons, may be present also at the level of the <BrainRegion>lateral cervical nucleus</BrainRegion>(LCN) .</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Response of <BrainRegion>septal</BrainRegion> cholinergic neurons to axotomy.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>In the present study we employed quantitative morphometric techniques to assay the response of <BrainRegion>septal</BrainRegion> cholinergic neurons following unilateral transection of the <BrainRegion>fimbria/fornix</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>supracallosal stria</BrainRegion>. Analysis of 50-micron-thick tissue sections with a Quantimet 920 image analysis system demonstrated a reduction in ChAT immunoreactivity as early as 1 day following denervation. This decrease was associated with a drop in the number of labeled cells ipsilateral to the lesion and a decrease in the area of cholinergic perikarya on the lesioned and nonlesioned side of the <BrainRegion>septum</BrainRegion>. The response at 1 day, however, was transient, and at 4 days the number of labeled neurons was not significantly different from controls. By 8 days we observed a dramatic reduction in the number and size of ChAT-positive cells ipsilateral to the lesion and a reduction in the size of cholinergic perikarya on the contralateral (i.e., nonlesioned) side. These values persisted throughout the remainder of the study. To assess more completely the morphologic response of neurons to axotomy than can be determined in 50-micron-thick tissue sections, we embedded the adjacent immunolabeled tissue section in Epon and then serially sectioned it to a thickness of 0.75-1.0 micron. By using this method, we were able to measure the area, length, and width of the cell, the area of the nucleus and nucleolus, and the position of the nucleus (i.e., eccentricity). Measurements were performed on ChAT-labeled and nonlabeled cells. The results of our studies demonstrate that cholinergic and noncholinergic cells responded to axotomy in a characteristic yet different fashion from each other and that this response could be quantitatively assayed. In general, labeled and nonlabeled cells on the lesioned side of the <BrainRegion>septum</BrainRegion> shrink in response to denervation. This shrunken state was reflected in measurements of cellular area, length, width, and nuclear area. Moreover, other measurements of cellular morphology (i.e., area of the nucleolus, position of the nucleus) indicate that none of the neuronal populations examined in the present study displayed morphologic evidence of regeneration. Our results indicate a dramatic loss of cholinergic perikarya ipsilateral to the lesion. Moreover, although a few neurons do persist they do so in a shrunken state. These data provide an essential baseline for the second study in this series, which will evaluate the effect of nerve growth factor on the survival of denervated <BrainRegion>septal</BrainRegion> neurons.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Quantitative analysis of the dendritic architectures of cat hypoglossal motoneurons stained intracellularly with horseradish peroxidase.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Little is known about the dendritic architecture of cat <BrainRegion>hypoglossal</BrainRegion> motoneurons. Thus, the present study was done to provide quantitative descriptions of <BrainRegion>hypoglossal</BrainRegion> motoneurons and to determine correlations between dendritic size parameters by using the intracellular horseradish peroxidase (HRP) injection technique in the cat. Twelve <BrainRegion>hypoglossa</BrainRegion>l motoneurons stained with horseradish peroxidase(HRP) were antidromically activated by stimulation applied to the <BrainRegion>medial branch of hypoglossal nerve</BrainRegion>. Eight (type I) and four (type II) of the 12 motoneurons were located in the <BrainRegion>ventral and dorsal parts of the ventromedial subnucleus of hypoglossal nucleus</BrainRegion>, respectively. The somatodendritic morphology of the two types of neurons was remarkably different, especially in the dendritic arborization pattern. The type I neurons established an egg-shaped dendritic tree that was distributed through the nucleus to the <BrainRegion>reticular formation</BrainRegion>; the type II dendritic tree was confined within the nucleus and presented a rostrocaudally oriented, mirror-image, fan-shape appearance. The total dendritic area and length and the number of terminations and branch points were significantly larger for type I than for type II neurons. For the two types of neuron, there was a positive correlation between stem dendritic diameter and several dendritic size parameters. Although the slopes of the regression lines were slightly different between the two, these were not statistically significant. The present study provides evidence that <BrainRegion>hypoglossal</BrainRegion> motoneurons located in the <BrainRegion>ventromedial subnucleus</BrainRegion> could be divided into two types according to the dendritic arborization pattern and quantitative analysis of the dendritic tree and according to neuronal location and suggests that the two types of <BrainRegion>hypoglossal</BrainRegion> motoneurons can be viewed as intrinsically distinct cell types: type I and type II, which innervate extrinsic and intrinsic muscles, respectively. In addition, the morphometric analysis made it possible to estimate the size of the dendritic tree by measuring the stem dendritic diameter.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Tectal</BrainRegion> connectivity in the frog Rana pipiens: tectotegmental projections and a general analysis of topographic organization.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Recent studies of visually elicited orienting in the frog Rana pipiens suggest that <BrainRegion>tectofugal</BrainRegion> signals important in this behavior relay in the midbrain <BrainRegion>tegmentum</BrainRegion> before descending to the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>. They also suggest that the high degree of topographic organization displayed by the retinotectal projection may be less characteristic of other <BrainRegion>tectal</BrainRegion> afferent and efferent pathways. To explore these possibilities, we have studied patterns of retrograde and anterograde labelling following multiple and single injections of horseradish peroxidase into the <BrainRegion>tectum</BrainRegion>. We have found that the midbrain <BrainRegion>tegmentum</BrainRegion> is a major terminal zone for <BrainRegion>tectal</BrainRegion> efferent projections. Our material also provided a description of the boundaries of other structures which project to and receive input from the <BrainRegion>tectum</BrainRegion>. With this background, we studied topographic organization by analyzing for each structure the distribution of labelling following multiple injections, and comparing it with the label distribution following single injections at <BrainRegion>tectal</BrainRegion> loci with known visual field input. Multiple injections produced patchy anterograde and retrograde labelling in the <BrainRegion>nucleus isthmi</BrainRegion>, with the number of patches corresponding to the number of <BrainRegion>tectal</BrainRegion> sites injected. Single injections produced labelling in restricted regions of the <BrainRegion>nucleus isthmi</BrainRegion>, the location of which varied systematically with the location of the <BrainRegion>tectal</BrainRegion> injection site. In all other structures studied, labelling was more evenly distributed following multiple injections. In none of these structures could we detect systematic variations in the location of labelling associated with variations in the location of single <BrainRegion>tectal</BrainRegion> injection sites, and the labelling following single injections was frequently coextensive with that following multiple injections. We also found no evidence that there exist structures which project to or receive input from particular <BrainRegion>tectal</BrainRegion> regions and not others. We conclude that there exist adequate neuroanatomical substrates for a tectotegmentospinal pathway believed to be important for visually elicited orienting in the frog. We also conclude that a high degree of topographic organization is more the exception than the rule in considering <BrainRegion>tectal</BrainRegion> connections generally in the frog. Topographic organization was readily apparent in connections related to the <BrainRegion>nucleus isthmi</BrainRegion> but not in connections related to any other nonretinal structure.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Cellular localization of lipocalin-type prostaglandin D synthase (beta-trace) in the central nervous system of the adult rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>We applied high-resolution laser-scanning microscopy, electron microscopy, and non-radioactive in situ hybridization histochemistry to determine the cellular and intracellular localization of lipocalin-type prostaglandin D synthase, the major brain-derived protein component of <BrainRegion>cerebrospinal fluid</BrainRegion>, and its mRNA in leptomeninges, choroid plexus, and parenchyma of the adult rat brain. Both immunoreactivity and mRNA for prostaglandin D synthase were located in arachnoid barrier cells, arachnoid trabecular cells, and arachnoid pia mater cells. Furthermore, meningeal macrophages and perivascular microglial cells, identified by use of ED2 antibody, were immunopositive for prostaglandin D synthase. In the arachnoid trabecular cells, the immunoreactivity for prostaglandin D synthase was located in the nuclear envelope, Golgi apparatus, and secretory vesicles, indicating the active production and secretion of prostaglandin D synthase. In the meningeal macrophages, prostaglandin D synthase was not found around the nucleus but in lysosomes in the cytoplasm, pointing to an uptake of the protein from the <BrainRegion>cerebrospinal fluid</BrainRegion>. Furthermore, the existence of meningeal cyclooxygenase (COX) -1 and cyclooxygenase(COX) -2 was investigated by Western blot, Northern blot, and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and the colocalization of cyclooxygenase(COX) -2 and prostaglandin D synthase was demonstrated in virtually all cells of the leptomeninges, choroid plexus epithelial cells, and perivascular microglial cells, suggesting that these cells synthesize prostaglandin D(2) actively. Alternatively, oligodendrocytes showed prostaglandin D synthase immunoreactivity without detectable cyclooxygenase(COX) -2. The localization of lipocalin-type prostaglandin D synthase in meningeal cells and its colocalization with cyclooxygenase(COX) -2 provide evidence for its function as a prostaglandin D(2)-producing enzyme.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Further characterization of the effects of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and ciliary neurotrophic factor on axotomized neonatal and adult mammalian motor neurons.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Neurotrophins and neural cytokines are two broad classes of neurotrophic factors. It has been reported that ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) prevent the degeneration of axotomized neonatal motor neurons. In addition, brain-derived neurotrophic factor(BDNF) is transported retrogradely to alpha-motor neurons following injection into the muscle, and patterns of brain-derived neurotrophic factor(BDNF) expressed in <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> and muscle suggest a physiological role for this factor in motor neurons. In the present study, we characterize the effects of brain-derived neurotrophic factor(BDNF) on axotomized neonatal facial motor neurons and extend these observations to adult models of motor neuron injury (axotomy-induced phenotypic injury of lumbar motor neurons). brain-derived neurotrophic factor(BDNF) reduces axotomy-induced degeneration of neonatal neurons by 55% as determined by Nissl staining (percentage of surviving neurons in vehicle-treated cases, 25%; in brain-derived neurotrophic factor(BDNF) -treated cases, 80%). Rescued neurons have an intact organelle structure but appear smaller and slightly chromatolytic on electron microscopic analysis. As demonstrated by intense retrograde labeling with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) applied to the proximal stump of the <BrainRegion>facial nerve</BrainRegion>, neurons rescued by brain-derived neurotrophic factor(BDNF) have intact mechanisms of fast axonal transport. ciliary neurotrophic factor(CNTF) did not appear to have significant effects on neonatal motor neurons, but the lack of efficacy of this factor may be caused by its rapid degradation at the application site. brain-derived neurotrophic factor(BDNF) is not capable of reversing the axotomy-induced reduction in transmitter markers [i.e., the acetylcholine-synthesizing enzyme choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) or the degrading enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in neonatal or adult animals or the axotomy-induced up-regulation of the low-affinity neurotrophin receptor p75NGFR (nerve growth factor receptor) in adult motor neurons. However, brain-derived neurotrophic factor(BDNF) appears to promote the expression of p75NGFR in injured neonatal motor neurons. In concert, the findings of the present study suggest that brain-derived neurotrophic factor(BDNF) can significantly prevent cell death in injured motor neurons. However, this neurotrophin may not be a retrograde signal associated with the induction and/or maintenance of some mature features of motor neurons, particularly their transmitter phenotype.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Neurogenesis in the visual system of the rat. An autoradiographic investigation.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Rats of the BD III strain were injected with a single dose of 3H-thymidine on either the twelfth, fourteenth, sixteenth, eighteenth or twentieth day of gestation (ED 12. . . . .ED 20) or on the postnatal day one, three, or seven. Animals were killed at age 22 to 24 days. DNA synthesis, as an indicator of cell division, was studied in matrix precursors of nerve and glial cells in the visula centers, including the <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate body</BrainRegion> (LGB), the <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion> (SC) and the <BrainRegion>visual cortex</BrainRegion> (VC). It was found that proliferation of matrix precursors of nerve cells destined for all the regions studied was in progress on ED 12. In the <BrainRegion>subcortical regions</BrainRegion> ( <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate body</BrainRegion>(LGB) , <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion>(SC) ) this process was substantially more advanced than in the <BrainRegion>visual cortex</BrainRegion>(VC) . The first neuroblasts appeared in the <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion>(SC) (ED 12) and only later (ED 14) in the <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate body</BrainRegion>(LGB) and <BrainRegion>visual cortex</BrainRegion>(VC) . In comparison with the <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate body</BrainRegion>(LGB) , <BrainRegion>visual cortex</BrainRegion>(VC) neuroblasts were quite rare on ED 14 and were present only in layer VI. They appeared more frequently in this region only after injection of isotope on ED 16. Matrix cell proliferation and nerve cell formation ceased in the <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate body</BrainRegion>(LGB) between ED 16 and ED 18. The number of labeled cells arising after injection of the isotope on ED 16 indicates that neurogenesis ceased somewhat earlier in the <BrainRegion>dorsal nucleus of the lateral geniculate body</BrainRegion>(LGB) than in the ventral. In the <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion>(SC) the last neurons arose between ED 18 and ED 20, and in the <BrainRegion>visual cortex</BrainRegion>(VC) , with the possible exception of a few granular neurons (which may continue division into the first few days postnatally), proliferation continued until the end of gestation. The origin of neuroblasts initially followed a caudo-rostral gradient. Later, the times of neurogenesis in the regions studied overlapped significantly. This is clear, for example. on ED 16, when neurogenesis in the <BrainRegion>mesencephalic superior colliculus</BrainRegion>(SC) continued for about two days longer than in the more postral <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate body</BrainRegion>(LGB) , and coincided with that in the <BrainRegion>visual cortex</BrainRegion>(VC) , especially in the deep layers. The end of neurogenesis in the <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate body</BrainRegion>(LGB) , especially in the <BrainRegion>ventral nucleus</BrainRegion>, coincided with the time of neurogenesis in the deep <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> layers. In the <BrainRegion>visual cortex</BrainRegion>(VC) , and partly also in the <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion>(SC) , an inside-out pattern of proliferation and neuron formation was confirmed. The times of proliferation of precursor cells, with the exception of the very end of neurogenesis, substantially overlapped within both these regions. The degree of this overlapping, described in terms of Labeling Index values, decreased towards the end of the neurogenetic period. Division of neuroglial cell precursors, started as early as on ED 14 in/for <BrainRegion>subcortical</BrainRegion> centers ( <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate body</BrainRegion>(LGB) , <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion>(SC) ), but not until ED 18 in/for the <BrainRegion>visual cortex</BrainRegion>(VC) . A few labeled endothelial-like cells were observed in all regions studied after isotope injection on ED 12.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Localization of last-order premotor interneurons in the <BrainRegion>lumbar spinal cord</BrainRegion> of rats.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>There is strong evidence that neural circuits underlying certain rhythmic motor behaviors are located in the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>. Such local central pattern generators are thought to coordinate the activity of motoneurons through specific sets of last-order premotor interneurons that establish monosynaptic contacts with motoneurons. After injections of biotinylated dextran amine into the lateral and medial motor columns as well as the ventrolateral white matter at the level of the upper and lower segments of the <BrainRegion>lumbar spinal cord</BrainRegion>, we intended to identify and localize retrogradely labelled spinal interneurons that can likely be regarded as last-order premotor interneurons in rats. Regardless of the location of the injection site, labelled interneurons were revealed in laminae V-VIII along a three- or four-segment-long section of the spinal gray matter. Although most of the stained cells were confined to laminae V-VIII in all cases, the distribution of neurons within the confines of this area varied according to the site of injection. After injections into the lateral motor column at the level of the L4-L5 segments, the labelled neurons were located almost exclusively in laminae V-VII ipsilateral to the injection site, and the perikarya were distributed throughout the entire mediolateral extent of this area. Interneurons projecting to the lateral motor column at the level of the L1-L2 segments were also located in laminae V-VII, but most of them were concentrated in the middle one-third or in the lateral half of this area. Following injections into the medial motor column at the level of the L1-L2 segments, the majority of labelled neurons were confined to the medial aspect of laminae V-VII and lamina VIII, and the proportion of neurons that were found contralateral to the injection site was strikingly higher than in the other experimental groups. The results suggest that the organization of last-order premotor interneurons projecting to motoneurons, which are located at different areas of the lateral and medial motor columns and innervate different muscle groups, may present distinct features in the rat <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Sympathetic neurons in the cat <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> projecting to the stellate ganglion.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was injected into the stellate ganglia of anesthetized cats. After a 2-day survival time the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> was processed for the Horseradish peroxidase(HRP) reaction to study the distribution of the preganglionic neurons which project to the stellate ganglia. Horseradish peroxidase(HRP) -labeled neurons in the cord were located exclusively on the side ipsilateral to the injected stellate ganglia and were concentrated in four distinct areas: (1) intermediolateral cell column (78.2%), (2) <BrainRegion>lateral funiculus</BrainRegion> (18.5%), (3) intercalated area and (4) central autonomic area (3.3%) for the latter 2 areas). Their distribution pattern in the very rostral pole of the thoracic sympathetic preganglionic cell column was different from the typical thoracic pattern in that a greater proportion of the cells were located in the <BrainRegion>lateral funiculus</BrainRegion>, and a few labeled cells were observed in the ventral horn. Longitudinally, a wide range (C8-T8) of <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> levels projected to the stellate ganglia, with a peak at the T2 level. These observations infer that a large population of axonal processes of sympathetic preganglionic neurons traveled several segments of the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> through an intraspinal pathway before exiting a particular ventral root.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Projections from <BrainRegion>bed nuclei of the stria terminalis</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>magnocellular nucleus</BrainRegion>: implications for <BrainRegion>cerebral hemisphere</BrainRegion> regulation of micturition, defecation, and penile erection.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The basic structural organization of axonal projections from the small but distinct <BrainRegion>magnocellular and ventral nuclei</BrainRegion> (of the <BrainRegion>bed nuclei of the stria terminalis</BrainRegion>) was analyzed with the Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin anterograde tract tracing method in adult male rats. The former&apos;s overall projection pattern is complex, with over 80 distinct terminal fields ipsilateral to injection sites. Innervated regions in the <BrainRegion>cerebral hemisphere</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion> fall into nine general functional categories: <BrainRegion>cerebral nuclei</BrainRegion>, behavior control column, orofacial motor-related, humorosensory/thirst-related, <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion> autonomic control network, neuroendocrine, <BrainRegion>hypothalamic</BrainRegion> visceromotor pattern-generator network, thalamocortical feedback loops, and behavioral state control. The most novel findings indicate that the <BrainRegion>magnocellular nucleus</BrainRegion> projects to virtually all known major parts of the brain network that controls pelvic functions, including micturition, defecation, and penile erection, as well as to brain networks controlling nutrient and body water homeostasis. This and other evidence suggests that the <BrainRegion>magnocellular nucleus</BrainRegion> is part of a corticostriatopallidal differentiation modulating and coordinating pelvic functions with the maintenance of nutrient and body water homeostasis. Projections of the <BrainRegion>ventral nucleus</BrainRegion> are a subset of those generated by the <BrainRegion>magnocellular nucleus</BrainRegion>, with the obvious difference that the <BrainRegion>ventral nucleus</BrainRegion> does not project detectably to <BrainRegion>Barrington&apos;s nucleus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>subfornical organ</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>median preoptic and parastrial nuclei</BrainRegion>, the neuroendocrine system, and <BrainRegion>midbrain</BrainRegion> orofacial motor-related regions.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Efferent projections of the <BrainRegion>deep mesencephalic nucleus (pars lateralis</BrainRegion>) in the rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The projections of the <BrainRegion>lateral part of the deep mesencephalic nucleus</BrainRegion> (DMN) were traced by autoradiography and retrograde horseradish peroxidase (HRP) techniques. At the level of the <BrainRegion>deep mesencephalic nucleus</BrainRegion>(DMN) , projections from its lateral part crossed the midline and terminated in the <BrainRegion>medial and lateral part of the contralateral deep mesencephalic nucleus</BrainRegion>(DMN) . Furthermore, two labeled tracts passed rostrally from the <BrainRegion>lateral part of the deep mesencephalic nucleus</BrainRegion>(DMN) . One tract coursed dorsolaterally from the <BrainRegion>lateral deep mesencephalic nucleus</BrainRegion>(DMN) to terminate in the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral lateral thalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>. The second tract coursed ventrally and rostrally over the <BrainRegion>substantia nigra</BrainRegion> toward the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral zona incerta</BrainRegion>. At the <BrainRegion>caudal part of the zona incerta</BrainRegion> these fibers divided into two bundles. One bundle coursed superiorly to terminate bilaterally in the <BrainRegion>mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus</BrainRegion>. The second bundle of fibers passed anteriorly to enter the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral zona incerta</BrainRegion>. Some of these fibers terminated upon neurons of the <BrainRegion>zona incerta</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>ventromedial part of the subthalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>. The remaining fibers within the <BrainRegion>zona incerta</BrainRegion> coursed anteriorly to enter the <BrainRegion>internal capsule</BrainRegion>. These fibers terminated in the <BrainRegion>entopeduncular nucleus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>medial part of the globus pallidus</BrainRegion>. These findings indicate that the <BrainRegion>lateral part of the deep mesencephalic nucleus</BrainRegion>(DMN) is likely to be involved in the ascending activating system of the <BrainRegion>reticular formation</BrainRegion> by connections with <BrainRegion>thalamic nuclei</BrainRegion>. Furthermore, the lateral part of the <BrainRegion>deep mesencephalic nucleus</BrainRegion>(DMN) may play a part in <BrainRegion>suprasegmental motor control</BrainRegion> via connections with <BrainRegion>rostral brain stem</BrainRegion> motor centers.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Organization of the face representation in macaque <BrainRegion>motor cortex</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>We stimulated with microelectrodes the face representation in <BrainRegion>precentral motor cortex</BrainRegion> in macaque monkeys. Responses were very discrete; at threshold current levels the usual response was a small focus of movement in part of a muscle. Facial muscles cluster together in the <BrainRegion>posterior and anterior portions of the precentral gyrus</BrainRegion> with tongue movements represented in the intervening region and along the lateral extent. Within each cluster there are multiple representations of individual muscle movements. In long penetrations down the anterior wall of the <BrainRegion>central sulcus</BrainRegion> we were able to advance the electrode tangentially through <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion>. In these penetrations we encountered a series of discrete zones each of which was related to the movement of a particular muscle or part of a muscle in the face. The lowest threshold points were found in the center of each zone, and as the microelectrode progressed toward the edge, thresholds rose until there was a shift to a new muscle movement. Successive stimulation points separated by as little as 50 micrometer could yield different responses. These zones could be either roughly cylindrical or take the form of narrow curving bands running mediolaterally across <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion>. There is a tendency for adjacent muscles to occur together, and the representation may be roughly topographical within the limits set by the morphological structure of the muscles themselves. The most commonly evoked muscle response was in zygomaticus, which retracts the corners of the mouth in expressions of fear and anger.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Projections from the <BrainRegion>lateral and interposed cerebellar nuclei</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion> of the rat: a light and electron microscopic study using single and double anterograde labelling.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The <BrainRegion>lateral and interposed cerebellar nuclei</BrainRegion> may have different functions in the control of movement. Efferent fibres from both nuclei project predominantly to areas of the <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion>, which in turn project to the <BrainRegion>motor cortex</BrainRegion>. In this study, single and double anterograde-tracing techniques have been used to examine and compare the pathways from the <BrainRegion>lateral and interposed nuclei</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion> in the rat by using both light and electron microscopy to look for evidence of organisational or structural features that may underlie the proposed functional differences between these nuclei. Terminals from the <BrainRegion>lateral nucleus</BrainRegion> were found to be located most <BrainRegion>medially in the thalamus</BrainRegion>, predominantly in the <BrainRegion>ventral lateral nucleus</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>rostral pole of the posterior nuclear group</BrainRegion>. Terminals from the <BrainRegion>posterior interposed nucleus</BrainRegion> were located slightly rostral and lateral to those from the <BrainRegion>lateral nucleus</BrainRegion>, mainly around the <BrainRegion>border between the ventral lateral nucleus and the ventral posterior medial nucleus</BrainRegion>. Terminals from the <BrainRegion>anterior interposed nucleus</BrainRegion> were located slightly rostral and lateral to those from the <BrainRegion>posterior interposed nucleus</BrainRegion>, predominantly in the <BrainRegion>rostral pole of the ventral posterior lateral nucleus</BrainRegion>. Terminals from the <BrainRegion>lateral and interposed nuclei</BrainRegion> were also found in double anterograde-tracing experiments to be nonoverlapping in the regions between these main areas of termination. The structure of terminals from the <BrainRegion>lateral and interposed nuclei</BrainRegion>, however, as well as their synaptic relationship with <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> neurones, were found to be similar. The terminals are large and form synapses with proximal dendrites of <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> neurones. They contained round vesicles and formed multiple synaptic contacts with dendritic shafts, as well as dendritic spines. The findings indicate that information from the <BrainRegion>lateral and interposed nuclei</BrainRegion> is processed in separate regions of the <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion> but that the mode of synaptic transfer to <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> neurones is likely to be similar for the two projections.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Androgen-concentrating cells in the <BrainRegion>periventricular</BrainRegion> brain of the female rhesus monkey.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Although androgens act on the primate central nervous system to modulate both endocrine functions and a number of <BrainRegion>limbic</BrainRegion>-related behaviors, little is known about the anatomical location of the neurons which sequester these steroids in primates. To determine the prime location of these androgen-concentrating neurons in the <BrainRegion>forebrain</BrainRegion> of the primate, we injected three castrated female rhesus monkeys in the femoral vein with 1 microgram of 5 alpha-dihydro (1,2,4,5,6,7-3H) testosterone (3H-DHT, 107 Ci/mmole) per kg of body weight. One of these animals also received an IV injection of 100 micrograms/kg body weight of unlabeled dihydrotestosterone ( dihydrotestosterone(DHT) ) to serve as a control. One hour after the injection of 3H- dihydrotestosterone(DHT) we rapidly exsanguinated each animal. The <BrainRegion>forebrain</BrainRegion> was sliced and blocks containing the <BrainRegion>amygdala</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>diencephalon</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>frontal pole</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion> were frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen until processing. The tissue was then processed for autoradiography. A specific topographic pattern of nuclear concentration of dihydrotestosterone(DHT)  or one of its metabolites was obtained in neurons of the <BrainRegion>basal hypothalamus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>preoptic region</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>amygdala</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion>. This pattern was similar to that found in rodent species.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Regional specificities in the distribution, chemical phenotypes, and coexistence patterns of neuropeptide containing nerve fibres in the human anal canal.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Despite the pivotal clinical significance of the human anal canal, little is known about its total and specific innervation. This study assessed the comparative distribution and histotopology of nerve fibres immunoreactive for neural markers and a variety of regulatory active neuropeptides in the human anal canal by light microscopic immunohistochemistry. Depending on the epithelial zone and region of the anal canal, the neural elements were differentially immunoreactive for the pan-neural marker protein gene product 9.5, the catecholamine marker tyrosine hydroxylase, the neuroendocrine marker chromogranin A, and various neuropeptides. Protein gene product 9.5-immunoreactive nerve fibres were ubiquitously abundant in the anal canal. In the anal transitional zone, ectopic epithelial types were supplied by the same pattern of peptidergic nerves as the respective type of epithelium in normotopic location. In the dermis of the squamous zone and in the perianal epidermis, unusual distribution patterns of nerve fibres, referred to as areas of high nerve fibre density, were encountered. Double immunohistochemistry revealed region-specific coexistence patterns of neuropeptidergic nerve fibres, and novel peptide coexistence patterns were detected in anal nerve fibres. Subsets of nerve fibres formed close spatial relationships with chromogranin A-positive neuroendocrine cells, most frequently in the anal transitional zone. Chromogranin-A positive cells were shown to be present in the epithelium of perianal eccrine sweat glands. The differential distribution, peptide phenotypes and coexistence patterns of different nerve fibre populations in the human anal canal may reflect topospecific regulatory functions of neurally released neuropeptides in health and disease.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Nerve growth factor receptor-immunoreactive neurons within the developing human <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>A monoclonal antibody recognizing the p75 receptor for nerve growth factor (NGF) was used to assess the immunohistochemical expression of nerve growth factor(NGF) receptors within the developing human <BrainRegion>neo-, limbic, and paralimbic cortices</BrainRegion> as well as the <BrainRegion>hippocampal complex</BrainRegion>. Between embryonic weeks 16 and 26, a transient population of neurons located within the <BrainRegion>upper and lower subplate zones of the neo-, limbic, and paralimbic cortices</BrainRegion> expressed the receptor for nerve growth factor(NGF) . In contrast, nerve growth factor(NGF) receptor-immunoreactive neurons were only observed in the <BrainRegion>upper subplate zone of the entorhinal cortex</BrainRegion> at embryonic week 40 (term), a staining pattern not observed in a 5-year-old specimen. The expression of nerve growth factor(NGF) receptor-immunoreactive neurons within the upper subplate zone between embryonic weeks 16 and 40 was characterized by a dense band of immunoreactive neurons and neuropil. These neurons were bipolar with basal and apically directed neurites. nerve growth factor(NGF) receptor-immunoreactive neurons were also scattered throughout the lower subplate zone and underlying white matter between embryonic weeks 19 and 26. These neurons were multipolar, with less apically directed neurites. nerve growth factor(NGF) receptor-immunoreactive subplate neurons displayed a topographic distribution with the heaviest concentration found within <BrainRegion>limbic and paralimbic cortices</BrainRegion> as well as association <BrainRegion>neocortex</BrainRegion>. In contrast, light to moderate nerve growth factor(NGF) receptor-immunoreactivity was seen in <BrainRegion>sensory-motor cortex</BrainRegion>. Within the <BrainRegion>hippocampal complex</BrainRegion>, only a few lightly stained nerve growth factor(NGF) receptor-immunoreactive neurons were seen within the <BrainRegion>fimbria</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>hilar region of the dentate gyrus</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>subiculum</BrainRegion>. The expression of nerve growth factor(NGF) receptor-immunoreactivity increased within the <BrainRegion>subplate zone of the pre- and parasubiculum</BrainRegion> culminating in intense <BrainRegion>entorhinal cortex</BrainRegion> staining. As the <BrainRegion>entorhinal cortex</BrainRegion> merged with the developing <BrainRegion>inferior temporal association cortex</BrainRegion>, there was a marked reduction in staining intensity. In contrast to those in the <BrainRegion>subplate zone</BrainRegion>, neurons within the <BrainRegion>germinal zone</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>cortical plate</BrainRegion> were nerve growth factor(NGF) receptor immunonegative at all times examined. The presence of nerve growth factor(NGF) receptors in the <BrainRegion>subplate zone</BrainRegion> suggests that neurotrophins such as nerve growth factor(NGF) play an important role in the transient viability of these neurons as well as in the guidance of <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> afferent inputs into topographically organized regions of the <BrainRegion>cerebral cortex</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Development of the neural <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> and its vasculature in the marmoset Callithrix jacchus.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The morphological sequence of <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> development in the New World marmoset monkey Callithrix jacchus is similar to previous reports in Macaca and humans. The incipient <BrainRegion>fovea</BrainRegion> is present at fetal day (Fd) 100 as the only part of the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> that contains five distinct layers, including a single layer of cone photoreceptors. A <BrainRegion>foveal pit</BrainRegion> begins to form at fetal day(Fd) 135 in the center of the <BrainRegion>foveal avascular zone</BrainRegion> which is surrounded by a ring of blood vessels (BV) and astrocytes. At birth ( fetal day(Fd) 144) the <BrainRegion>fovea</BrainRegion> has a single layer of cones over the pit center where the inner <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> layers are thinned but still separated. After birth the <BrainRegion>fovea</BrainRegion> rapidly matures so that <BrainRegion>foveal cone and pit</BrainRegion> morphology are similar to adult by 4 months. Five distinct layers and the blood vessels(BV) plexus in the nerve fiber layer are present to the <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> edge in neonatal marmosets. Near the <BrainRegion>optic disc</BrainRegion> blood vessels(BV) are sprouting into outer <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> layers at birth and vascularization of the outer <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> is completed by 2 to 3 months. <BrainRegion>Retinal</BrainRegion> length increases sharply up to fetal day(Fd) 135, but undergoes a quiescent period around birth during which pit formation begins. Length then increases again up to 4mo, followed by a slow increase into adulthood. The postnatal increase is accompanied by a marked thinning of the peripheral <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>pars plana</BrainRegion> appears after birth and its length increases at least until 2 years of age. The major difference between marmoset and Macaca is the relative immaturity of the marmoset <BrainRegion>fovea</BrainRegion> at birth, and its rapid development after birth. This makes the marmoset a good candidate for neonatal experimental manipulation of <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> and eye development.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Simple and complex <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> ganglion cell axonal rearrangements at the <BrainRegion>optic chiasm</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The rearrangements that <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> ganglion cell (RGC) axons undergo near the <BrainRegion>optic chiasm</BrainRegion> were determined by ablating either the <BrainRegion>nasal, temporal, dorsal, ventral, or peripheral retina</BrainRegion>. The axons of the remaining intact <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> ganglion cell(RGC) s were then labelled with cobaltous lysine. <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> ganglion cell(RGC) axons change their relationship with respect to the axes of the brain and with respect to one another. Toward the caudal end of the <BrainRegion>optic chiasm</BrainRegion>, the optic tract begins to rotate axially such that its rostral edge ultimately becomes located medially. Thereby, the column of <BrainRegion>ventronasal retinal</BrainRegion> ganglion cell(RGC) axons shifts from a rostral to a medical position. In addition, columns of axons from other <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> sectors move with respect to one another. <BrainRegion>Ventrotemporal retinal</BrainRegion> ganglion cell(RGC) axons, located initially at the caudal edge of the tract, move toward and come to be positioned laterally to, the column of <BrainRegion>ventronasal retinal</BrainRegion> ganglion cell(RGC) axons. The column of <BrainRegion>dorsonasal retinal</BrainRegion> ganglion cell(RGC) axons moves from the rostral to the lateral side of the column of <BrainRegion>dorsotemporal retinal</BrainRegion> ganglion cell(RGC) axons. Concurrently, the axons within each column reorganize internally. Each chronological lamina of axons within a column twists such that the nasal and temporal axons within each column invert their positions with respect to the edges of the column. All of these reorganizations take place between the <BrainRegion>caudal end of the optic chiasm</BrainRegion> and the division of the main optic tract into the optic brachia. Furthermore, the rearrangements that occur do not involve any alterations in the positions of <BrainRegion>central and peripheral retinal</BrainRegion> ganglion cell(RGC) axons with respect to the surface of the <BrainRegion>diencephalon</BrainRegion>. The results are discussed with respect to mechanisms that might influence the organization of the visual pathways.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Histochemical evidence for sympathetic innervation of hair receptor afferents in cat skin.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The goal of the present study was to demonstrate histochemically fine catecholamine-containing sympathetic nerve fibers which might be associated with hair receptor afferent fibers in cat skin. Positive results would be consistent with the hypothesis that the sympathetically mediated desensitization of hair afferents, observed in this an earlier studies, is mediated by direct neurotransmitter release onto the afferent fibers. Activity in single primary afferent fibers was recorded electrophysiologically during mechanical stimulation of hairs and electrical stimulation of the lumbar sympathetic trunk in anesthetized cats. The mechanical threshold for activation was seen to increase markedly during low-frequency sympathetic stimulation. Fresh-frozen sections of skin from cat hindleg were treated with glyoxylic acid for detection of fluorescent catecholamines. Fluorescent fibers were observed in association with hair follicles as well as with arterioles and arrector-pili muscles. Subsequent silver staining of the identical skin sections revealed that the fine catecholamine-containing fibers located near hair follicles were closely associated with hair receptor afferent fibers. The results of hair receptor sensitivity is mediated by direct neurotransmitter release onto the afferent fibers.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Differential distribution of the MeCP2 splice variants in the postnatal mouse brain.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Mutations in the gene encoding methyl CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) are the primary cause of the neurodevelopmental disorder Rett syndrome (RTT). Mecp2-deficient mice develop a neurological phenotype that recapitulates many of the symptoms of Rett syndrome(RTT) , including postnatal onset of the neurological deficits. methyl CpG binding protein 2(MeCP2) has two isoforms, methyl CpG binding protein 2(MeCP2) e1 and methyl CpG binding protein 2(MeCP2) e2, with distinct amino termini, which are generated by alternative splicing. We examined the distribution of the Mecp2 splice variants in the postnatal mouse brain by in situ hybridization and found regional and age-related differences in transcript abundance. In newborn mice, signals for total Mecp2 and the Mecp2e2 transcripts were widely distributed, with overlapping expression patterns throughout the brain. Expression of the Mecp2e2 splice variant became largely restricted to nuclei within the <BrainRegion>dorsal thalamus</BrainRegion> (DT) and <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> layer V in juvenile animals, a pattern that was maintained into adulthood. In contrast, the total Mecp2 riboprobe only weakly labeled the <BrainRegion>dorsal thalamus</BrainRegion>(DT) and <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> layer V in juvenile and adult animals, although it heavily labeled surrounding brain regions, suggesting that Mecp2e1 is the predominant transcript outside the <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion>. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to measure Mecp2e1 and Mecp2e2 abundance in the <BrainRegion>diencephalon</BrainRegion> of adult mice, demonstrating significantly more Mecp2e2 in the <BrainRegion>dorsal thalamus</BrainRegion>(DT) than in the <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion>, which is in agreement with the Mecp2e2 in situ hybridization. The differential distribution of the Mecp2e1 and Mecp2e2 transcripts indicates regional and developmental regulation of Mecp2 splicing in the postnatal mouse brain.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Estrogen regulation of cell proliferation and distribution of estrogen receptor-alpha in the brains of adult female prairie and meadow voles.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Adult female prairie (Microtus ochrogaster) and meadow (M. pennsylvanicus) voles were compared to examine neural cell proliferation and the effects of estrogen manipulation on cell proliferation in the <BrainRegion>amygdala</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>ventromedial hypothalamus</BrainRegion> (VMH), and <BrainRegion>dentate gyrus of the hippocampus</BrainRegion> (DG). Unlike prior studies, our study focused on the <BrainRegion>amygdala</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>ventromedial hypothalamus</BrainRegion>(VMH) , because they are involved in social behaviors and may underlie behavioral differences between the species. Meadow voles had a higher density of cells labeled with the cell proliferation marker 5-bromo-2&apos;-deoxyuridine (BrdU) in the <BrainRegion>amygdala</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>DG</BrainRegion> than did prairie voles. Treatment with estradiol benzoate (EB) for 3 days increased the density of 5-bromo-2&apos;-deoxyuridine(BrdU) -labeled cells in the <BrainRegion>amygdala</BrainRegion>, particularly in the <BrainRegion>posterior cortical</BrainRegion> (pCorA) and <BrainRegion>medial (pMeA) nuclei</BrainRegion>, in meadow, but not prairie, voles. Furthermore, the majority of the 5-bromo-2&apos;-deoxyuridine(BrdU) -labeled cells in the <BrainRegion>posterior cortical</BrainRegion>(pCorA) and <BrainRegion>pMeA</BrainRegion> displayed either a neuronal or a glial progenitor phenotype, but no species or treatment differences were found in the percentage of neuronal or glial progenitor cells. To understand better estrogen&apos;s effects on adult neurogenesis, we also examined estrogen receptor-alpha (ERalpha) distribution. Meadow voles had more estrogen receptor-alpha(ERalpha) -labeled cells in the <BrainRegion>posterior cortical</BrainRegion>(pCorA) and <BrainRegion>ventromedial hypothalamus</BrainRegion>(VMH) , but not in the <BrainRegion>pMeA</BrainRegion> or <BrainRegion>DG</BrainRegion>, than did prairie voles. In addition, more than one-half of the 5-bromo-2&apos;-deoxyuridine(BrdU) -labeled cells in the <BrainRegion>amygdala</BrainRegion> of both species coexpressed estrogen receptor-alpha(ERalpha) labeling. Together, these data indicate that estrogen alters cell proliferation in a species- and region-specific manner, and some of these effects may lie in the specific localization of estrogen receptors in the adult vole brain.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Corticocortical connections predict patches of stimulus-evoked metabolic activity in monkey <BrainRegion>somatosensory cortex</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Stimulus-evoked metabolic activity in the <BrainRegion>anterior parietal cortex</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>areas 3a, 3b, 1, and 2</BrainRegion>) occurs in the form of column-like patches. Similar patches characterize the connections to, within, and from these fields. The relation of the patches elicited metabolically to those formed by retrograde or anterograde transport, however, is not clear. If a type of projection connecting <BrainRegion>areas 3a, 3b, 1, and 2</BrainRegion> transmits sensory information among these <BrainRegion>cortical fields</BrainRegion>, the resultant projection pattern may directly contribute to the definition of somatosensory metabolic &quot;columns." To test this possibility, electrophysiological recordings in <BrainRegion>areas 3b and 1</BrainRegion> of Macaca fascicularis monkeys characterized stimuli that elicited the best neuronal response at a specific <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> site. Iontophoretic injections of wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) were subsequently made into the identified <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> sites. Two days later, the animals were injected with 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) and received the somatic stimulus previously determined to best activate the neurons isolated at the injected <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> site. After injections of wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase(WGA-HRP) into physiologically defined loci in <BrainRegion>area 3b</BrainRegion>, the patches of transported label within <BrainRegion>areas 3b and 1</BrainRegion> were colocalized with evoked metabolic activity. Injections of wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase(WGA-HRP) into <BrainRegion>area 1</BrainRegion> produced anterogradely labeled terminals in <BrainRegion>areas 1 and 2</BrainRegion> that also overlapped with patches of evoked metabolic activity, as did patches of retrogradely labeled cells located in <BrainRegion>area 3b</BrainRegion>. Patches of anterograde label found in <BrainRegion>area 3b</BrainRegion> after <BrainRegion>area 1</BrainRegion> injections, however, were not coincident with the metabolically activated patches. These findings suggest that excitatory information is transmitted from <BrainRegion>area 3b</BrainRegion> to <BrainRegion>area 1</BrainRegion> in a way that connects clusters of cells with similar response properties.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Mapping heparanase expression in the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> of adult rats.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>This work addresses the cellular localization of heparanase and its colocalization with syndecan-3, a transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan in <BrainRegion>spinal cords</BrainRegion> of adult rats. Reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and in situ hybridization for the heparanase transcript revealed expression in neurons and white matter glia. This was confirmed by immunohistochemistry showing cytoplasmic localization of the heparanase protein. Double immunofluorescence for heparanase and syndecan-3 revealed colocalization of the proteins in cell bodies of neurons and oligodendrocytes, suggestive of constitutive expression in these cell types. In contrast, only subpopulations of astrocytes and NG2-expressing glia in the white matter expressed heparanase, and these did not show expression of syndecan-3. Cultures of astrocytes further evidenced upregulation of heparanase expression with TGF-beta(1) treatment, but no accompanying upregulation of syndecan-3 was detectable. These first findings of heparanase expression in the adult cord therefore provide the cellular basis for understanding functional interactions of heparanase and syndecan-3 in the normal neural network or otherwise in glial reactions to <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> injury.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>5&apos;-nucleotidase: a new marker for striosomal organization in the rat <BrainRegion>caudoputamen</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The distribution of the adenosine-producing ectoenzyme 5&apos;-nucleotidase was studied by means of a histochemical lead technique in the <BrainRegion>caudoputamen</BrainRegion> of normal adult rats and of rats in which injections either of 6-hydroxydopamine in the <BrainRegion>medial forebrain</BrainRegion> bundle or of ibotenic acid in the <BrainRegion>caudoputamen</BrainRegion> had been made 1-3 weeks previously. The patterns of <BrainRegion>striatal</BrainRegion> 5&apos;-nucleotidase activity in these animals were compared in serial sections to the patterns of calbindin-D28k immunoreactivity and of 3H-naloxone ligand binding, which respectively mark the known <BrainRegion>matrix and striosome (patch) compartments of the caudoputamen</BrainRegion>. In the normal rats, 5&apos;-nucleotidase activity was differentially concentrated in striosomes, where it produced a dense staining of the neuropil. The enzymatic staining followed a striosomal distribution in all but the <BrainRegion>caudal caudoputamen</BrainRegion>. Within the <BrainRegion>striatal matrix</BrainRegion>, 5&apos;-nucleotidase staining also observed a lateromedial density gradient. Depletion of the dopamine-containing nigrostriatal innervation of the <BrainRegion>caudoputamen</BrainRegion> with 6-hydroxydopamine did not alter the striosomal selectivity of 5&apos;-nucleotidase activity. Destruction of intrastriatal neurons by ibotenic acid led to a strongly 5'-nucleotidase-positive gliosis within the resulting necrotic region. Elsewhere in the <BrainRegion>caudoputamen</BrainRegion>, the enzyme&apos;s striosomal distribution was not detectably altered. We conclude that 5'-nucleotidase histochemistry provides an advantageous tool for detecting the striosomal architecture of the rat's <BrainRegion>caudoputamen</BrainRegion>. Moreover, 5&apos;-nucleotidase is prominently associated with glial membranes in the central nervous system, so that the concentration of this enzyme in striosomes could mark these as sites of selective glial populations within <BrainRegion>striatum</BrainRegion>. These properties and actions of 5&apos;-nucleotidase in purinergic neurotransmission and in neuroadhesion may contribute to the specialized functions of striosomes and matrix.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Developmental growth and degeneration of pulpal axons in feline primary incisors.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The life history of pulpal axons in primary mandibular incisors was examined by light and electron microscopy in 56 kittens aged from 25 days postconception to 120 days after birth. Cells resembling Schwann cells preceded the first arrival of pulpal axons, 1 week postnatally. myelination was initiated during the second week. Two months after birth the incisors were fully grown and each pulp contained about 100 axons. Between 10 and 20% of these were myelinated and ranged in size from 1 to 5 micrometer. The relation between number of myelin lamellae and axon size appeared nonlinear and differed markedly from that in similarly sized inferior alveolar nerve axons. During the third month many unmyelinated axons showed signs of degeneration. With progress of root resorption an increasing proportion of both unmyelinated and myelinated axons degenerated. In highly resorbed incisors necrotic Schwann cells were associated with degenerating axons and there was a generalized pulpal tissue reaction. In some teeth with advanced root resorption pulpal axons were lacking. A progressive derangement of all pulpal tissue elements continued until shedding during the second half of the fourth month. In incisor nerve branches below the incisor teeth axon degeneration was very limited.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Fiber connections of the <BrainRegion>central nucleus of semicircular torus</BrainRegion> in cyprinids.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Fiber connections of the presumed <BrainRegion>auditory portion of the semicircular torus</BrainRegion> or the <BrainRegion>central nucleus</BrainRegion> (TSc) as well as other <BrainRegion>central and peripheral auditory structures</BrainRegion> were studied by tract-tracing methods in carp and goldfish. Major ascending projections to the <BrainRegion>torus or the central nucleus</BrainRegion>(TSc) originated from the <BrainRegion>descending octaval nucleus</BrainRegion> (DO) and <BrainRegion>medullary secondary octaval</BrainRegion> population (SO). Toropetal neurons of the <BrainRegion>descending octaval nucleus</BrainRegion>(DO) were within the <BrainRegion>saccular terminal zone</BrainRegion>. A small number of toropetal <BrainRegion>descending octaval nucleus</BrainRegion>(DO) neurons might receive inputs from other <BrainRegion>inner ear</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>lateral line endorgans</BrainRegion> as well. Fibers from the <BrainRegion>descending octaval nucleus</BrainRegion>(DO) terminated in a <BrainRegion>deep zone of the torus</BrainRegion> or the <BrainRegion>central nucleus</BrainRegion>(TSc) , while those from the <BrainRegion>secondary octaval</BrainRegion> population(SO) in both deep and superficial zones. Afferents to the <BrainRegion>torus</BrainRegion> or the <BrainRegion>central nucleus</BrainRegion>(TSc) also arose from the <BrainRegion>rhombencephalic reticular formation</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>anterior octaval nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>isthmic reticular nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>perilemniscular nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>medial pretoral nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>anterior tuberal nucleus</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>central posterior thalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>torus</BrainRegion> or the <BrainRegion>central nucleus</BrainRegion>(TSc) projected ascending fibers to the <BrainRegion>medial pretoral nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>anterior tuberal nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>central posterior thalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>preglomerular complex</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>anterior preglomerular nucleus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>caudomedial region of lateral preglomerular nucleus</BrainRegion>, and a <BrainRegion>medial zone of medial preglomerular nucleus</BrainRegion>). These parts of <BrainRegion>preglomerular complex</BrainRegion> appear structurally continuous sharing common hodological and cytoarchitectonic features, and thus might be regarded as a single neuronal population. Abundant descending pathways were also noted in the present study. Of particular note is the <BrainRegion>medial pretoral nucleus</BrainRegion>, which received fibers from <BrainRegion>diencephalic auditory nuclei</BrainRegion>. The nucleus gave rise to indirect descending pathways to a <BrainRegion>medial zone of the cerebellar crest</BrainRegion> where dendrites of crest cells in the <BrainRegion>secondary octaval</BrainRegion> population(SO) ramify.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>The <BrainRegion>inner ear</BrainRegion> of the lungfish Protopterus.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The <BrainRegion>sensory end organs of the inner ear</BrainRegion> of the lungfish, Protopterus, were examined using scanning and transmission electron microscopy. The utricle has a structure and hair cell orientation pattern that are typical for vertebrates, although the hair cells are unusually large. There are the typical three <BrainRegion>semicircular canals</BrainRegion> extending from the <BrainRegion>utricle</BrainRegion>, with the typical hair cell orientations, but the <BrainRegion>lateral canal sensory crista</BrainRegion> looks like the &quot;hemicrista" of some amphibians and amniotes, lacking a saddle-shaped flare on one wall of the <BrainRegion>ampulla</BrainRegion>. Unlike most vertebrates that have the <BrainRegion>saccule</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>lagena</BrainRegion> as two separate pouches ventral to the utricle, the lungfish has a single large ventral pouch that contains a single large pasty otoconial mass. This mass covers two hair cell patches, each like a striola with prominent hair cell ciliary bundles, that are presumed to represent <BrainRegion>saccular</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>lagenar</BrainRegion> maculae. However, these two major sensory patches are not completely separate maculae because they lie within a less densely populated field of smaller hair cells, which forms an extrastriolar region that surrounds and fills the region between the two striolae of higher hair cell density. The more caudal <BrainRegion>lagenar</BrainRegion> striola is a vertically elongated stripe with hair cell orientation vectors facing antiparallel on either side of a midline drawn vertically along the macula, resembling the macula <BrainRegion>lagena</BrainRegion> of some bony fishes but not of tetrapods. The more <BrainRegion>rostral saccula</BrainRegion>r striola is a curving band with hair cell orientation vectors facing away from its midline, but because this macula curves in three dimensions, the vectors at the rostral end of this striola are oriented mediolaterally, whereas the vectors on the caudal half of this striola are oriented dorsoventrally. The presence of a <BrainRegion>macula neglecta</BrainRegion> was confirmed near the posterior canal as a tiny single patch of a few dozen hair cells with all the cell orientations directed caudally. The ciliary bundles on the cells in the striolar-like regions of all of three <BrainRegion>otolithic organs</BrainRegion> average over 80 cilia, a number far greater than for any other fish studied to date. The features of the single sacculolagenar pouch with separate striolar-like regions, the cellular orientation in the <BrainRegion>otolith organs</BrainRegion>, and the large cells and ciliary bundles in Protopterus also were observed in specimens of the other extant lungfish genera, Lepidosiren and Neoceratodus.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Morphological and electrophysiological characteristics of layer V neurons of the rat <BrainRegion>lateral entorhinal cortex</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The intrinsic electrophysiological and morphological properties of <BrainRegion>lateral entorhinal area</BrainRegion> (LEA) layer V neurons were investigated by sharp electrode intracellular recording and biocytin labeling in vitro. The morphological analysis revealed that layer V of the <BrainRegion>lateral entorhinal area</BrainRegion>(LEA) contains three distinct subtypes of principal neurons, which were classified as pyramidal, horizontal, and polymorphic neurons. Pyramidal cells were the most abundant subtype (57%) and could be further subdivided into neurons with large, small, and star-like somas. Similarly to pyramidal cells, horizontal neurons (11%) had a prominent apical dendrite. However, their distinctive basal dendritic plexus extended primarily in the horizontal plane. Polymorphic neurons (32%) were characterized by a multipolar dendritic organization. Electrophysiological analysis of neurons in the three categories demonstrated a diversity of electrophysiological profiles within each category and no significant differences between groups. Neurons in the three subgroups could display instantaneous and/or time-dependent inward rectification and different degrees of spike frequency adaptation. None of the recorded cells displayed an intrinsic oscillatory bursting discharge. Many neurons in the three subgroups, however, displayed slow (3.5-14 Hz), sustained, subthreshold membrane potential oscillations. The morphological and electrophysiological diversity of principal neurons in the <BrainRegion>lateral entorhinal area</BrainRegion>(LEA) parallels that previously reported for the <BrainRegion>medial entorhinal area</BrainRegion> and suggests that, with respect to the deep layers, similar information processing is performed across the <BrainRegion>mediolateral extent of the entorhinal cortex</BrainRegion>. Layer V of the <BrainRegion>entorhinal cortex</BrainRegion> may undertake very complex operations beyond acting as a relay station of <BrainRegion>hippocampal</BrainRegion> processed information to the <BrainRegion>neocortex</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Morphometric modifications associated with early sensory experience in the rat <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>: II. Stereological study of the population of <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> glomeruli.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The present study explores the local variations of size and number of <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> glomeruli induced by the exposure of young rats to long-term stimulation with a single odor. Three groups of 5 rats were used that were either: (1) stimulated with ethyl acetoacetate from birth to 1 month of age, (2) unilaterally deprived following early occlusion of one nare, or (3) normal animals of the same age. Areas and coordinates of all glomerular profiles were measured in 14 coronal sections uniformly distributed along the rostrocaudal axis of the <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>. A distribution-free stereological method was applied to compute the size and number of glomeruli either along the <BrainRegion>bulbar rostrocaudal extent</BrainRegion> or in the <BrainRegion>bulbar coronal plane</BrainRegion>. Following complete sensory deprivation or long-term stimulation with ethyl acetoacetate, the mean diameter of glomeruli was significantly reduced everywhere, except in the <BrainRegion>ventrolateral and ventromedial regions of the posterior olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> in rats reared with a single odor. In both of these areas, the number of glomeruli was either significantly increased following long duration exposure or significantly reduced following unilateral deprivation. Thus these results show that selective modifications of the <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> environment during postnatal maturation induce morphometric variations in specific areas of the glomerular layer. These data are discussed with respect to the concept of the topographical coding of odor quality at the level of the glomeruli and plasticity of the olfactory system during postnatal development.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Topographic organization of convergent projections to the <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion> from the <BrainRegion>inferior colliculus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> in the rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The purpose of this study was to identify <BrainRegion>thalamic areas</BrainRegion> receiving convergent sensory inputs from acoustic and <BrainRegion>spinal</BrainRegion> projection systems in the rat. The topographic distribution of afferents to the <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion> from the <BrainRegion>inferior colliculus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> was examined by using WGA-HRP as an anterograde axonal tracer. Following injections in the <BrainRegion>inferior colliculus</BrainRegion>, terminal labeling was present in <BrainRegion>ventral, medial, and dorsal divisions of the medial genicuate body</BrainRegion> (MGB) and in adjacent areas of the <BrainRegion>posterior thalamus</BrainRegion>, including the <BrainRegion>posterior limitans nucleus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>posterior intralaminar nucleus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>marginal zone</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>peripeduncular region</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>lateral or parvicellular part of the subparafascicular nucleus</BrainRegion>, and a <BrainRegion>region intercalated between the posterior limitans nucleus and the suprageniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>. In the <BrainRegion>caudal thalamus</BrainRegion> <BrainRegion>spinal</BrainRegion> projections remained in the <BrainRegion>reticular formation medial to the collicular terminal field</BrainRegion>. At intermediate levels of the <BrainRegion>MG</BrainRegion>, however, the <BrainRegion>spinal</BrainRegion> projection began to overlap the <BrainRegion>collicular field</BrainRegion>, terminating in the <BrainRegion>medial division of the MG</BrainRegion> and in the <BrainRegion>posterior intralaminar nucleus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>marginal zone</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>lateral subparafascicular nucleus</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>area between the suprageniculate and posterior limitans nuclei</BrainRegion>. More rostrally, the convergent field expanded to include aspects of the <BrainRegion>dorsal MG division</BrainRegion>. The extent to which afferent projections to the <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion> from the <BrainRegion>inferior colliculus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> converge is thus graded in the <BrainRegion>caudorostral plane</BrainRegion>, with the greatest overlap occurring at the level of the <BrainRegion>rostral third of the medial genicuate body</BrainRegion>(MGB) . These observations identify potential areas of acoustic and somesthetic integration and may account for observations of neuronal plasticity in the <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion> in response to the pairing of acoustic and somesthetic inputs.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Developmental changes in the relationship between type 2 synapses and spiny neurons in the monkey <BrainRegion>visual cortex</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>This study continues an exploration of synaptic development in the <BrainRegion>primary visual cortex</BrainRegion> of the monkey (Macaca nemestrina). In a prior study (Mates and Lund, &apos;83a), we observed that type 2 synapses on the cell bodies of spiny stellate neurons of lamina 4C appeared not only to increase in number during early postnatal development but also subsequently decreased during maturation. Using quantitative, stereological electron microscopic methods, we examined the maturation of this synapse population from embryonic day 159 to adult, on spiny stellate neurons of 4C alpha and beta and, for comparison, on pyramidal neurons in upper and lower lamina 6. Tissue was also taken for comparison from two animals reared to 8 weeks of age with binocular eyelid closure from birth. We confirmed that a marked increase and subsequent decrease occurred in this somal type 2 synapse population on both neuron populations. However, due to the infrequency of the smooth dendritic neurons (approximately 5% of the neuron population) giving rise to the type 2 contacts, and due to expansion of the neuropil during maturation increasing intercell distances against constant volume of the type 2 axon arbors, it is concluded that the decrease in type 2 somal synapses may represent a redistribution to dendrites rather than loss from the neuropil. Cells of lamina 4C beta (receiving input from the parvocellular lateral geniculate nucleus-LGN) show a slower initial accumulation of type 2 contacts compared to neurons of lamina 4C alpha (receiving input from magnocellular LGN), or to pyramidal neurons of lamina 6.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Retinofugal projections in the lepidosirenid lungfishes.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Autoradiographic and silver methods indicate that the African and South American lungfishes, Protopterus and Lepidosiren, lack <BrainRegion>ipsilateral retinal</BrainRegion> projections. Contralaterally, the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> projects to the <BrainRegion>preoptic nucleus of the hypothalamus</BrainRegion>, to four discrete areas located in the <BrainRegion>lateral neuropil of the thalamus</BrainRegion>, to a <BrainRegion>superficial pretectal neuropil</BrainRegion>, to the <BrainRegion>upper half of the tectal neutropil</BrainRegion>, and to a <BrainRegion>laterally situated basal optic neuropil</BrainRegion> located in the <BrainRegion>rostral tegmentum</BrainRegion>. The overall pattern of the <BrainRegion>primary retinofugal</BrainRegion> projections is markedly similar to that of amphibians which suggests that lungfishes may be more closely related to amphibians than to actinopterygian fishes. Neotenic trends in both lepidosirenid lungfishes and urodeles may be expressions of parallelism, hence Latimeria and Neoceratodus must be examined to resolve this phylogenetic problem. A 300-fold range in the size of the eye, indicated by the number of ganglion cells present, occurs among lungfishes, salamanders and frogs. This variation may have implications for recognizing the morphological expression of selection operating on the visual systems of lepidosirenids and amphibians.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Topography of <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> projections to the <BrainRegion>dorsolateral neostriatum</BrainRegion> in rats: multiple overlapping sensorimotor pathways.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>In rodents, the whisker representation in <BrainRegion>primary somatosensory (SI) cortex</BrainRegion> projects to the <BrainRegion>dorsolateral neostriatum</BrainRegion>, but the location of these projections has never been characterized with respect to layer IV barrels and their intervening septa. To address this issue, we injected a retrograde tracer into the <BrainRegion>dorsolateral neostriatum</BrainRegion> and then reconstructed the location of the labeled corticostriatal neurons with respect to the cytochrome oxidase (CO)-labeled barrels in <BrainRegion>SI</BrainRegion>. When the tracer was restricted to a small focal site in the <BrainRegion>neostriatum</BrainRegion>, the retrogradely labeled neurons formed elongated strips that were parallel to the curvilinear orientation of layer IV barrel rows. After larger tracer injections, labeled neurons were distributed uniformly across layer V and were aligned with both the barrel and septal compartments. Labeled projections from the <BrainRegion>contralateral SI barrel cortex</BrainRegion>, however, were much fewer in number and were disproportionately associated with the septal compartments. A comparison of the labeling patterns in the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres revealed symmetric, mirror-image distributions that extended across <BrainRegion>primary motor cortex</BrainRegion> (MI) and multiple <BrainRegion>somatosensory cortical regions</BrainRegion>, including the <BrainRegion>secondary somatosensory (SII) cortex</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>parietal ventral</BrainRegion> (PV) and <BrainRegion>parietal rhinal (PR) areas</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>posteromedial (PM) region</BrainRegion>. Examination of the <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion> revealed labeled neurons in the <BrainRegion>intralaminar nuclei</BrainRegion>, in the <BrainRegion>medial part of the posterior nucleus</BrainRegion> (POm), and in the <BrainRegion>ventrobasal complex</BrainRegion>. These results indicate that the <BrainRegion>dorsolateral neostriatum</BrainRegion> integrates sensorimotor information from multiple sensorimotor representations in the <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Neurochemical organization of the human <BrainRegion>basal ganglia</BrainRegion>: anatomofunctional territories defined by the distributions of calcium-binding proteins and SMI-32.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The distribution of the calcium-binding proteins calbindin-D28K (CB), parvalbumin (PV) and calretinin (CR), and of the nonphosphorylated neurofilament protein (with SMI-32) was investigated in the human <BrainRegion>basal ganglia</BrainRegion> to identify anatomofunctional territories. In the <BrainRegion>striatum</BrainRegion>, gradients of neuropil immunostaining define four major territories: The first (T1) includes all but the <BrainRegion>rostroventral half of the putamen</BrainRegion> and is characterized by enhanced matriceal parvalbumin(PV) and SMI-32 immunoreactivity (-ir). The second territory (T2) encompasses most part of the <BrainRegion>caudate nucleus</BrainRegion> (Cd) and <BrainRegion>rostral putamen</BrainRegion> (PuT), which show enhanced matriceal calbindin-D28K(CB) -ir. The third and fourth territories (T3 and T4) comprise <BrainRegion>rostroventral parts of caudate nucleus</BrainRegion>(Cd) and <BrainRegion>putamen</BrainRegion>(PuT) characterized by complementary patch/matrix distributions of calbindin-D28K(CB) - and calretinin(CR) -ir, and the <BrainRegion>accumbens nucleus</BrainRegion> (Acb), respectively. The latter is separated into lateral (prominently enhanced in calbindin-D28K(CB) -ir) and medial (prominently enhanced in calretinin(CR) -ir) subdivisions. In the <BrainRegion>pallidum</BrainRegion>, parallel gradients also delimit four territories, T1 in the caudal half of external (<BrainRegion>GPe</BrainRegion>) and internal (<BrainRegion>GPi</BrainRegion>) divisions, characterized by enhanced parvalbumin(PV) - and SMI-32-ir; T2 in their rostral half, characterized by enhanced calbindin-D28K(CB) -ir; and T3 and T4 in their rostroventral pole and in the <BrainRegion>subpallidal area</BrainRegion>, respectively, both expressing calbindin-D28K(CB) - and calretinin(CR) -ir but with different intensities. The <BrainRegion>subthalamic nucleus</BrainRegion> (STh) shows contrasting patterns of dense parvalbumin(PV) -ir (sparing only the most medial part) and low calbindin-D28K(CB) -ir. Expression of calretinin(CR) -ir is relatively low, except in the medial, low parvalbumin(PV) -ir, part of the nucleus, whereas SMI-32-ir is moderate across the whole nucleus. The <BrainRegion>substantia nigra</BrainRegion> is characterized by complementary patterns of high neuropil calbindin-D28K(CB) - and SMI-32-ir in <BrainRegion>pars reticulata</BrainRegion> (SNr) and high calretinin(CR) -ir in <BrainRegion>pars compacta</BrainRegion> (SNc) and in the <BrainRegion>ventral tegmental area</BrainRegion> (VTA). The compartmentalization of calcium-binding proteins and SMI-32 in the human <BrainRegion>basal ganglia</BrainRegion>, in particular in the <BrainRegion>striatum</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>pallidum</BrainRegion>, delimits anatomofunctional territories that are of significance for functional imaging studies and target selection in stereotactic neurosurgery.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Patterns of expression of neuropeptides in GABAergic nonprincipal neurons in the mouse <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion>: Quantitative analysis with optical disector.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Neuropeptides are widely distributed in the central nervous system and are considered to play important roles in the regulation of neuronal activity. This study shows the patterns of expression of four neuropeptides [neuropeptide Y (NPY), somatostatin (SOM), cholecystokinin (CCK), and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)] in gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic neurons of the mouse <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion>, with particular reference to the areal and dorsoventral difference. First, we estimated the numerical densities (NDs) of gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) ergic neurons containing these neuropeptides using the optical disector. The numerical densities(NDs) of [neuropeptide Y(NPY) - and somatostatin(SOM) -positive gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) ergic neurons were generally higher than those of cholecystokinin(CCK) - and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide(VIP) -positive gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) ergic neurons. In the whole area of the <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion>, the ND of [neuropeptide Y(NPY) -positive gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) ergic neurons showed no significant dorsoventral difference (1.90 x 10(3)/mm(3) in the dorsal level, 2.09 x 10(3)/mm(3) in the ventral level), whereas the ND of somatostatin(SOM) -positive gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) ergic neurons was higher in the ventral level (1.44 x 10(3)/mm(3)) than in the dorsal level (0.80 x 10(3)/mm(3)). The ND of cholecystokinin(CCK) -positive gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) ergic neurons was also higher in the ventral level (0.57 x 10(3)/mm(3)) than in the dorsal level (0.33 x 10(3)/mm(3)). Similarly, the ND of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide(VIP) -positive gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) ergic neurons was higher in the ventral level (0.61 x 10(3)/mm(3)) than in the dorsal level (0.43 x 10(3)/mm(3)). Next, we calculated the proportions of gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) ergic neurons containing these neuropeptides among the total gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) ergic neurons. In the whole area of the <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion>, [neuropeptide Y(NPY) -, somatostatin(SOM) -, cholecystokinin(CCK) -, and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide(VIP) -positive neurons accounted for about 31%, 17%, 7%, and 8% of gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) ergic neurons, respectively. The present data establish a baseline for examining potential roles of gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) ergic neurons in the <BrainRegion>hippocampal</BrainRegion> network activity in mice.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Angiotensin converting enzyme in the human <BrainRegion>basal forebrain</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>midbrain</BrainRegion> visualized by in vitro autoradiography.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>angiotensin converting enzyme converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II, a peptide that plays an important role in the central regulation of blood pressure and fluid and electrolyte homeostasis. However, the distribution of this enzyme in the human brain has not been well described. In this study, angiotensin converting enzyme was mapped in the human <BrainRegion>basal forebrain</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>midbrain</BrainRegion> by using quantitative in vitro autoradiography employing a derivative of a potent converting enzyme inhibitor, 125I-351A, as radioligand. This radioligand binds specifically and with high affinity to angiotensin converting enzyme and also exhibited these properties in binding to slide-mounted sections of human <BrainRegion>basal ganglia</BrainRegion>. In the <BrainRegion>basal ganglia</BrainRegion>, high levels of binding of 125I-351A are found in the <BrainRegion>caudate nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>putamen</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>nucleus accumbens</BrainRegion>, both divisions of the <BrainRegion>globus pallidus</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>substantia nigra pars reticulata</BrainRegion>. High densities of labelling also occur in the <BrainRegion>ventral pallidum</BrainRegion>. In the <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion>, a moderate level occurs in the <BrainRegion>paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei</BrainRegion>, and a diffuse, low level of binding is found throughout the <BrainRegion>periventricular region</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis</BrainRegion>, one of the <BrainRegion>circumventricular organs</BrainRegion>, displays the highest concentration of binding. The choroid plexus contains only moderate density of labelling in contrast to other mammalian species previously studied. Major fibre tracts are devoid of activity except for the posterior limb of the <BrainRegion>internal capsule</BrainRegion>, which contains fascicles of intense activity. In the <BrainRegion>midbrain</BrainRegion>, a moderate density of binding is detected in the <BrainRegion>periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion>. The dorsal, central linear, and, more caudally, the <BrainRegion>centralis superior medialis raphe nuclei</BrainRegion> also contain moderate densities of labelling. Angiotensin converting enzyme is heterogeneously distributed in the <BrainRegion>caudate nucleus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>putamen</BrainRegion>, with distinct patches of high concentration surrounded by a matrix of diffuse, lower levels. In the <BrainRegion>caudate nucleus</BrainRegion>, these patches of high binding corresponded to striosomes since they register with acetylcholinesterase-poor zones. The high concentration of angiotensin converting enzyme found in the <BrainRegion>basal ganglia</BrainRegion> suggests that the enzyme may be involved in processing neuropeptides that occur in high concentrations in these structures. Possible substrates for converting enzyme include not only angiotensin I but also substance P and enkephalins, which are also concentrated in striosomes.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Postnatal development of the <BrainRegion>inferior olivary complex</BrainRegion> in the rat: IV. Synaptogenesis of GABAergic afferents, analyzed by glutamic acid decarboxylase immunocytochemistry.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The postnatal maturation of the GABAergic innervation of the rat <BrainRegion>inferior olive</BrainRegion> was studied with an antiserum to glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), the GABA-synthesizing enzyme. glutamic acid decarboxylase(GAD) -positive axons were present at a very low density in the <BrainRegion>periolivary and interlamellar regions</BrainRegion> of newborn rats, as well as in certain precise areas of the lamellae, at the mediodorsal limit. The immature distribution indicates that the GABAergic projections reach the <BrainRegion>inferior olive</BrainRegion> shortly before birth and that the greater part of synaptogenesis and the establishment of the adult organization occurs postnatally. Light and electron microscopic analyses disclosed that the maturation of this system of <BrainRegion>olivary</BrainRegion> afferents passes through three well-defined stages: (1) During the first, or immature stage (from PO to P5), glutamic acid decarboxylase(GAD) immunoreactivity is not confined to axon terminals, as in adult rats. The labeled fibers penetrate progressively into the periphery of the lamellae and reach their centers in an irregular manner by the end of the immature stage. This staggered invasion of the lamellae accentuates intraregional <BrainRegion>olivary</BrainRegion> differences and begins to take the adult configuration. As fiber penetration advances, the density of labeled axons establishing synaptic contacts increases, while the number of completely immunostained fibers decreases. This distribution prevails until the end of the immature stage and suggests that the GABAergic afferent projections remain in a &quot;waiting compartment" from their prenatal arrival until the moment they invade the <BrainRegion>olivary parenchyma</BrainRegion>. (2). The second stage is designated as an intermediate stage of maturation and lasts from P7 to P10. During this period, glutamic acid decarboxylase(GAD) axoplasmic compartmentation occurs, and henceforth only axon terminals exhibit glutamic acid decarboxylase(GAD) immunoreactivity. Concomitantly, intraregional differences in the pattern of innervation become more marked, because of the continuing irregular distribution of the growing labeled axons. This intermediate maturational stage is also characterized by a rapid increase in labeled axon terminals bearing synaptic complexes and by the formation of complex synaptic arrangements, the protoglomeruli. From the beginning of protoglomeruli formation, glutamic acid decarboxylase(GAD) -positive axon terminals are one of their constituents, and they are systematically localized at the periphery of the incipient dendritic protrusions. (3) The final stage of maturation takes place from P10 to P15. During this stage, the adultlike pattern of GABAergic innervation of the inferior olive is attained. Toward P15, intraregional differences in glutamic acid decarboxylase(GAD) immunoreactivity are similar to those of the adult rat.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Plasticity in a central nervous pathway in xenopus: anatomical changes in the isthmotectal projection after larval eye rotation.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>In this paper we present evidence that early eye rotation in Xenopus leads to anatomical rearrangements in a portion of the binocular visual system. In the past, electrophysiological mapping had shown that the topography of the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral visuotectal</BrainRegion> projection is changed by such eye rotation and that this change requires visual experience. However, knowledge of the anatomical basis for this electrophysiological change was lacking. The identification of the <BrainRegion>nucleus isthmi</BrainRegion> as a link in the projection has allowed us to study the topography of the ipsilateral system by use of horseradish peroxidase. We present data showing that early eye rotation alters the topography of the crossed <BrainRegion>isthmotectal</BrainRegion> projection. These results demonstrate that the orientation of a topographically organized projection can be changed by procedures which do not involve direct manipulation of the source, pathway, or target of the projection.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Characterization of the central nervous system innervation of the rat spleen using viral transneuronal tracing.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Splenic immune function is modulated by sympathetic innervation, which in turn is controlled by inputs from <BrainRegion>supraspinal regions</BrainRegion>. In the present study, the characterization of central circuits involved in the control of splenic function was accomplished by injecting pseudorabies virus (PRV), a retrograde transynaptic tracer, into the spleen and conducting a temporal analysis of the progression of the infection from 60 hours to 110 hours postinoculation. In addition, central noradrenergic cell groups involved in splenic innervation were characterized by dual immunohistochemical detection of dopamine-beta-hydroxylase and pseudorabies virus(PRV) . Infection in the CNS first appeared in the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>. Splenic sympathetic preganglionic neurons, identified in rats injected with Fluoro-Gold i.p. prior to pseudorabies virus(PRV) inoculation of the spleen, were located in <BrainRegion>T(3)-T(12)</BrainRegion> bilaterally; numerous infected interneurons were also found in the <BrainRegion>thoracic spinal cord</BrainRegion> (T(1)-T(13)). Infected neurons in the brain were first observed in the <BrainRegion>A5 region</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>ventromedial medulla</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>rostral ventrolateral medulla</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>Barrington&apos;s nucleus</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>caudal raphe</BrainRegion>. At intermediate survival times, the number of infected cells increased in previously infected areas, and infected neurons also appeared in <BrainRegion>lateral hypothalamus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>A7 region</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>locus coeruleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>subcoeruleus region</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion>, and C3 cell group. At longer postinoculation intervals, infected neurons were found in additional <BrainRegion>hypothalamic areas</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>Edinger-Westphal nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>caudal ventrolateral medulla</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>area postrema</BrainRegion>. These results demonstrate that the sympathetic outflow to the spleen is controlled by a complex multisynaptic pathway that involves several <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>forebrain nuclei</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Axonal projections from the <BrainRegion>lateral and medial superior olive</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>inferior colliculus</BrainRegion> of the cat: a study using electron microscopic autoradiography.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The <BrainRegion>superior olivary complex</BrainRegion> is the first site in the central auditory system where binaural interactions occur. The output of these nuclei is direct to the <BrainRegion>central nucleus of the inferior colliculus</BrainRegion>, where binaural inputs synapse with monaural afferents such as those from the <BrainRegion>cochlear nuclei</BrainRegion>. Despite the importance of the <BrainRegion>olivary</BrainRegion> pathways for binaural information processing, little is known about their synaptic organization in the <BrainRegion>colliculus</BrainRegion>. The present study investigates the structure of the projections from the <BrainRegion>lateral and medial superior olivary nuclei</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>inferior colliculus</BrainRegion> at the electron microscopic level. Stereotaxic placement and electrophysiological responses to binaural sounds were used to locate the <BrainRegion>superior olive</BrainRegion>. Anterograde axonal transport of 3H-leucine was combined with light and electron microscopic autoradiography to reveal the location and morphology of the <BrainRegion>olivary</BrainRegion> axonal endings. The results show that the <BrainRegion>superior olivary complex</BrainRegion> contributes different patterns of synaptic input to the <BrainRegion>central nucleus of the inferior colliculus</BrainRegion>. Each projection from the <BrainRegion>superior olivary complex</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>colliculus</BrainRegion> differs in the number and combinations of endings. Axonal endings from the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral medial superior olive</BrainRegion> were exclusively the round (R) type that contain round synaptic vesicles and make asymmetrical synaptic junctions. This morphology is usually associated with excitatory synapses and neurotransmitters such as glutamate. Endings from <BrainRegion>medial superior olive</BrainRegion> terminate densely in the <BrainRegion>central nucleus</BrainRegion>. The projection from the <BrainRegion>contralateral lateral superior olive</BrainRegion> also terminates primarily as R endings. This projection also includes small numbers of pleomorphic (PL) endings that contain pleomorphic synaptic vesicles and usually make symmetrical synaptic junctions. The pleomorphic(PL) morphology is associated with inhibitory synapses and transmitters such as gamma-aminobutyric acid and glycine. All endings from the <BrainRegion>contralateral lateral superior olive</BrainRegion> terminate much less densely than endings from the <BrainRegion>medial olive</BrainRegion>. In contrast, the projection from the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral lateral superior olive</BrainRegion> contributes both R and pleomorphic(PL) endings in roughly equal proportions. These ipsilateral afferents are heterogeneous in density and can terminate in lower or higher concentrations than endings from the contralateral side. These data show that the <BrainRegion>superior olive</BrainRegion> is a major contributor to the synaptic organization of the <BrainRegion>central nucleus of the inferior colliculus</BrainRegion>. The ipsilateral projections of the <BrainRegion>medial and lateral superior olive</BrainRegion> may produce higher concentrations of R endings than other inputs to the <BrainRegion>central nucleus</BrainRegion>. Such endings may participate in excitatory synapses. The highest concentrations of pleomorphic(PL) endings come from the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral lateral superior olive</BrainRegion>.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Effects of visual or light deprivation on the morphology, and the elimination of the transient features during development, of type I <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> ganglion cells in hamsters.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Intracellular injection of Lucifer Yellow (LY) was used to study the detailed morphology of the normal visually deprived, and light-deprived <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion> projecting Type I <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> ganglion cells (RGCs) in hamsters. The soma size of the normal Type I cells ranged from 337 to 583 microns 2 with a mean of 436 microns 2. Two to six primary dendrites were observed in these cells. The mean dendritic field diameter was 495 microns and ranged from 309 to 702 microns. The dendritic field diameter of this population of cells exhibited an eccentricity dependence. Quantitative comparisons between the normal and visually deprived or light-deprived Type I <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> ganglion cells(RGCs) indicated that the morphology of these three groups of cells were similar to each other in terms of the soma size, dendritic field diameter, branching pattern, and total length of the dendrites. During the normal development of cats and hamsters, several transient features, such as exuberant dendritic spines and intraretinal axonal branches, have been observed in the developing <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> ganglion cells(RGCs) . The complete elimination of these transient features occurs at about 3 and 2 weeks after the opening of the eyes in cats and hamsters, respectively. In the present study, the hypothesis whether visual experience or light stimulation is required for the elimination of these transient features during development was examined. After studying a total of 115 mature Type I <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> ganglion cells(RGCs) , which included cells from the normal, visually deprived and light deprived animals, no transient feature was observed. We conclude that visual or light deprivation has no effect on the morphological development of <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion> projecting Type I <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> ganglion cells(RGCs) in hamsters, and the elimination of the transient features on the Type I retinal ganglion cells(RGCs) during development does not depend on visual experience or light stimulation.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Developing descending neurons of the early Xenopus tail <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> in the <BrainRegion>caudal spinal cord</BrainRegion> of early Xenopus.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The enzyme horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was used to describe and identify neurons, axons of which initiate the earliest descending pathways of the tail <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> of Xenopus embryos and larvae. <BrainRegion>Spinal cords</BrainRegion> were pierced at different rostrocaudal levels with fine insect pins coated with horseradish peroxidase(HRP) . The resulting pattern of cellular labeling indicated that primitive sensory (Rohon-Beard) axons were at the lead of developing descending tracts followed by axons of primary motor neurons. Axons of these two neuron types travel in widely separated fascicles located dorso- and ventro-laterally, respectively. Subsequently, axons of several morphologically distinct intersegmental interneurons establish several additional fascicles positioned dorsal to the descending motor axons. Descending <BrainRegion>supraspinal</BrainRegion> axons appear only later. The distinctive morphological characteristics of each of the early descending cell types are illustrated along with some stages in their early differentiation. These observations establish the temporal pattern by which new axons are added to descending pathways beginning with the simplest level of the amphibian <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> and determine the identity of neurons to which axons at early stages in this sequence belong.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Further evidence of an early critical period in the development of the cat&apos;s <BrainRegion>dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The concept of an early postnatal critical period of development for the <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion> was assessed by determining in adult cats whether previously established properties of <BrainRegion>geniculate</BrainRegion> neurons could be altered by varying the cat&apos;s visual experience. The analysis was limited to lamina A1 and the binocular segment of lamina A, and the properties studied were the percentage of physiologically recorded Y-cells and cell soma size. Eleven experimental cats in four groups were studied, and three cats reared normally plus three cats reared with continuous monocular lid suture served as controls. Two cats raised first with monocular suture followed by a prolonged period in adulthood with both eyes open had cell size distributions and Y-cell proportions that were indistinguishable from cats raised with continuous monocular suture. Four cats raised first with one eye sutured underwent a reverse suture procedure in adulthood (i.e., the originally sutured eye opened and the other closed) and were maintained in this fashion for a prolonged period. These cats also had geniculate cell size distributions and Y-cell proportions that were indistinguishable from cats raised with continuous monocular suture. Two cats were raised first with binocular suture followed by a prolonged period in adulthood with one eye opened. Their <BrainRegion>geniculate</BrainRegion> cell size distributions and Y-cell proportions showed no effect on the adult monocular deprivation and were indistinguishable from previously published data concerning cats raised with continuous binocular suture. Finally, three normally raised cats underwent a prolonged period of monocular suture in adulthood. Their geniculate cell size distributions and Y-cell proportions showed no effects on the adult monocular deprivation. From these data, we conclude that an early critical period of development occurs for <BrainRegion>geniculate</BrainRegion> cell sizes and Y-cell proportions. Adult visual environments, whether normal or abnormal, had no detectable effect on <BrainRegion>geniculate</BrainRegion> neurons for these previously developed properties, whether normal or abnormal.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Distribution and relative abundance of neurons in the pigeon <BrainRegion>forebrain</BrainRegion> containing somatostatin, neuropeptide Y, or both.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Immunohistochemical studies in several mammalian species and in red-eared turtles have shown that somatostatin (SS) and neuropeptide Y (NPY) co-occur in a substantial proportion of the <BrainRegion>telencephalic</BrainRegion> neurons containing either. To explore further the possibility that <BrainRegion>telencephalic</BrainRegion> neurons co-containing somatostatin(SS) and neuropeptide Y(NPY) may be evolutionarily conserved among amniotes, we determined the distribution and co-occurrence of somatostatin(SS) and neuropeptide Y(NPY) in <BrainRegion>forebrain</BrainRegion> neurons in pigeons. Single-label immunohistochemical studies revealed the presence of overlapping populations of somatostatin(SS) + neurons and neuropeptide Y(NPY) + neurons in most of the major subdivisions of the <BrainRegion>telencephalon</BrainRegion>. Double-label immunofluorescence studies revealed that in <BrainRegion>subdivisions of the telencephalon</BrainRegion> that are comparable to mammalian <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion> (i.e., those <BrainRegion>dorsal and lateral to the basal ganglia</BrainRegion>), the vast majority of neuropeptide Y(NPY) + neurons were also somatostatin(SS) +, whereas a major and regionally variable percentage of the somatostatin(SS) + neurons were not neuropeptide Y(NPY) +. In contrast, within the <BrainRegion>basal telencephalon</BrainRegion> (including the <BrainRegion>basal ganglia</BrainRegion> and several other structures) neurons labeled only for neuropeptide Y(NPY) or only somatostatin(SS) were more abundant than those containing both neuropeptides. Outside the <BrainRegion>telencephalon</BrainRegion>, the only <BrainRegion>forebrain</BrainRegion> cell group containing neurons in which somatostatin(SS) and neuropeptide Y(NPY) were co-localized was in the <BrainRegion>lateral hypothalamus</BrainRegion>. A series of double- and triple-label immunohistochemical studies was undertaken to determine the extent of co-occurrence of somatostatin(SS) and neuropeptide Y(NPY) in <BrainRegion>striatal</BrainRegion> neurons and the relationship of these neurons to <BrainRegion>striatal</BrainRegion> neurons containing other neuropeptides. In addition, immunohistochemical single- and double-label techniques were employed in conjunction with retrograde-labeling by fluorogold to determine the projections of somatostatin(SS) + and neuropeptide Y(NPY) + <BrainRegion>striatal</BrainRegion> neurons. The results indicate that: 1) a population of <BrainRegion>striatal</BrainRegion> interneurons containing both somatostatin(SS) and neuropeptide Y(NPY) exists in pigeons and constitutes approximately the same fraction of all <BrainRegion>striatal</BrainRegion> neurons as reported in mammals, 2) neurons containing neuropeptide Y(NPY) (but not somatostatin(SS) ) form a second, larger population of <BrainRegion>striatal</BrainRegion> interneurons, 3) neurons containing somatostatin(SS) (but not neuropeptide Y(NPY) ) form a third population of striatal interneurons that is approximately half as abundant as the neuropeptide Y(NPY) + interneuron population, and 4) one-third of the substance P-containing striatonigral projection neurons also contain somatostatin(SS) . The existence in pigeons of a major population of neurons containing both somatostatin(SS) and neuropeptide Y(NPY) throughout the <BrainRegion>telencephalon</BrainRegion>, the existence of a population of neurons containing only somatostatin(SS) in cortex-equivalent parts of the <BrainRegion>telencephalon</BrainRegion>, and the existence of a population of interneurons containing only neuropeptide Y(NPY) in the <BrainRegion>striatum</BrainRegion> is consistent with findings in mammals and turtles.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Distribution of synapses on two ascending interneurones carrying frequency-specific information in the auditory system of the cricket: evidence for GABAergic inputs.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Two identified cricket auditory interneurones, AN1 and AN2, were intracellularly labelled with horseradish peroxidase following physiological characterisation. The neurones, which have some structural similarities, have their somata in the prothoracic ganglion and axons that project to the brain. Although both carry auditory information, they have different response properties and participate in different types of phonotactic behaviour. Ultrathin sections from selected regions of their prothoracic arborisations were examined in the electron microscope after postembedding immunostaining for the inhibitory transmitter GABA. In the prothoracic ganglion AN1 branches only in the <BrainRegion>medial ventral association centre</BrainRegion> (mVAC) contralateral to the soma, and receives only iput synapses. Twenty-seven percent of these were made by processes immunoreactive for GABA. AN2 branches not only in <BrainRegion>medial ventral association centre</BrainRegion>(mVAC) on both sides of the ganglion but also in several other areas. It makes output synapses from large diameter neurites in <BrainRegion>medial ventral association centre</BrainRegion>(mVAC) on both sides of the ganglion as well as from neurites in more posterior regions of the neuropile. Most input synapses are received onto branches in the <BrainRegion>contralateral medial ventral association centre</BrainRegion>(mVAC) where about 19% were made from GABA-immunoreactive processes.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Morphology of sympathetic preganglionic neurons in the <BrainRegion>thoracic spinal cord</BrainRegion> of the cat: an intracellular horseradish peroxidase study.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Horseradish peroxidase was intracellularly injected into sympathetic preganglionic neurons (SPN) of the <BrainRegion>third thoracic segment</BrainRegion> in cats. Seven neurons were reconstructed from serial horizontal or parasagittal sections of the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>. The cell bodies of all neurons were located in the <BrainRegion>n. intermediolateralis pars principalis</BrainRegion> (ILp). They were spindle-shaped with the long axis in craniocaudal direction or large and multipolar or small and oval in shape. Preferentially on the cranial and caudal pole of the cell body, five to eight primary dendrites arose from the cell body. Dendritic branches were traced to their terminations at distances up to 1,330 microns from the cell body. The dendritic fields of all sympathetic preganglionic neurons(SPN) s were strictly oriented in the longitudinal direction with a total length of 1,500-2,540 microns. The cranial and caudal dendritic fields were about equal in length but, with one exception, the degree of branching was always greater in the cranial than in the caudal dendritic field. The dendritic fields of all sympathetic preganglionic neurons(SPN) s were primarily restricted to the <BrainRegion>intermediolateralis pars principalis</BrainRegion>(ILp) . In the mediolateral direction it extended from 130 to 360 microns and in the dorsoventral direction from 50 to 180 microns. Only rarely, a higher-order dendrite left the boundaries of the <BrainRegion>intermediolateralis pars principalis</BrainRegion>(ILp) and projected dorsolaterally or laterally into the white matter or ventromedially or medially into the adjacent <BrainRegion>n. intercalatus</BrainRegion>. All dendrites showed various forms of spines. At a distance of 132-437 microns from the cell body the axon arose as a direct extension of a process which closely resembled a primary or second-order dendrite. The axons projected ventrally and mostly caudally along the lateral border of the gray matter until they turned laterally at the end of the ventral horn. No axon collaterals were observed.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Single fiber studies of ascending input to the <BrainRegion>cuneate nucleus</BrainRegion> of cats: II. Postsynaptic afferents.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The morphology of single postsynaptic afferent fibers terminating in the <BrainRegion>feline cuneate nucleus</BrainRegion> was investigated by using transport of Phasolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin from the <BrainRegion>cervical spinal cord</BrainRegion> and intraaxonal injections of horseradish peroxidase into identified postsynaptic fibers in the cuneate fasciculus. Injections of Phaseolus in <BrainRegion>C5</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>C6</BrainRegion> of both rhizotomized and non-rhizotomized cats gave similar results and confirmed previous observations with other techniques. In one animal with the smallest injection and the fewest labeled fibers in the <BrainRegion>cuneate nucleus</BrainRegion>, ten individual collaterals were reconstructed from serial sections. Most of these collaterals were at middle levels of the <BrainRegion>cuneate</BrainRegion> (from obex to about 4 mm caudal to it); they were largely confined to the rim and ventral regions of the nucleus, and their terminal fields were restricted rostrocaudally. Electrophysiologically identified fibers stained with horseradish peroxidase had large receptive fields on the ipsilateral forepaw, and latencies suggesting an oligosynaptic link to the periphery. Most of the collaterals from these fibers were also at middle cuneate levels and terminated mainly at the periphery of the nucleus but gave rise to larger terminal arbors, including sparse terminal branches to the core of the nucleus. Individual postsynaptic fibers differed in several respects from primary afferent fibers. While the spacing of collaterals of postsynaptic fibers was intermediate between that of G hair and Ia fibers, their arbors were larger than either, and could extend through the dorsoventral extent of the <BrainRegion>cuneate nucleus</BrainRegion>. The pattern of bifurcation of postsynaptic fibers resulted in stringier arbors which encompassed larger and less dense terminal fields than those of primary afferents. The number of boutons per collateral was intermediate between G hair and Ia fibers, but boutons of postsynaptic fibers were substantially smaller. These morphological differences are consistent with distinct functional roles for the two main ascending afferent systems, as suggested by electrophysiological data.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Subcortical</BrainRegion> projections of six <BrainRegion>visual cortical areas</BrainRegion> in the owl monkey, Aotus trivirgatus.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText><BrainRegion>Subcortical</BrainRegion> projections of six <BrainRegion>visual cortical areas</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>Areas 17</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>18</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>Middle Temporal</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>Dorsomedial and Medial Areas</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>Posterior Parietal Region</BrainRegion>) in the owl monkey, Aotus trivigatus, were investigated with autoradiographic methods following injections of tritiated proline. No contralateral projections were demonstrated. While some <BrainRegion>brainstem structures</BrainRegion> received input from all six subdivisions of <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion>, each <BrainRegion>cortical area</BrainRegion> appeared to exhibit its own unique pattern of <BrainRegion>subcortical</BrainRegion> projections. All six <BrainRegion>cortical areas</BrainRegion> were found to project to the <BrainRegion>superior and inferior divisions of the pulvinar</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>reticular nucleus of the thalamus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>pretectum</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion>. Other <BrainRegion>subcortical</BrainRegion> targets of one or more <BrainRegion>visual cortical areas</BrainRegion> were the <BrainRegion>basal ganglia</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>claustrum</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>zona incerta</BrainRegion>, one or more of the <BrainRegion>intralaminar nuclei</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>lateral posterior nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>pregeniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>pontine nuclei</BrainRegion>. Furthermore, details of corticofugal projections to the <BrainRegion>dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>pretectum</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion> varied with the <BrainRegion>cortical area</BrainRegion> studied. The projections to the <BrainRegion>reticular nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>pregeniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>inferior and a portion of the superior division of the pulvinar</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion> were found to be topographically organized. The targets of the <BrainRegion>subcortical</BrainRegion> projections were compared with those of the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>, as revealed by autoradiographic methods following tritiated proline injections of the eye and were found to overlap to varying extents in the <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>pretectum</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion> and to be segregated in the <BrainRegion>pregeniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>. The results substantiate the validity of previous studies in the owl monkey that suggest that the <BrainRegion>visual cortex</BrainRegion> is subdivided into several functionally distinct areas; and illustrate the complexity of corticofugal influence on visual processing.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Influence of reduced neuron pool on the magnitude of naturally occurring motor neuron death.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The present investigation was undertaken to examine the role of peripheral competition in survival of motor neurons during development. A loss of approximately half of the <BrainRegion>trochlear</BrainRegion> motor neurons in duck and quail occurs during the course of normal embryogenesis. The number of motor neurons in the nucleus of quail prior to the onset of cell death is identical to the final number of survivors in the nucleus of duck embryos (about 1,300 neurons). In the present study competition at the peripheral target was decreased by reducing the number of <BrainRegion>trochlear</BrainRegion> motor neurons initially projecting to their target muscle. This was accomplished by substituting the midbrain of duck embryos with the same neural tissue from quail embryos. <BrainRegion>Midbrain</BrainRegion> transplantation was performed before motor axon outgrowth and normal cell death begin. The development of the motor neurons and their sole target of innervation, the superior oblique muscle, was examined by using a variety of techniques. The source of the grafted motor neurons and of a reduction in the size of the motor neuron pool was confirmed from histological sections and cell counts. The grafted motor neurons projected their axons into the appropriate peripheral target, which was determined by the use of HRP tracing technique. Counts of muscle fibers, motor endplates, and acetylcholine receptors and measurement of total muscle protein indicated that the size of the superior oblique muscle in the chimera embryos was similar to that of the normal duck but significantly larger than the muscle in quail embryos. Electrophysiological observations indicated that the grafted <BrainRegion>trochlear</BrainRegion> motor neurons made functional connections with the superior oblique muscle. Counts of the <BrainRegion>trochlear</BrainRegion> motor neurons after the period of cell death indicated an average of 1,310 neurons in the nucleus of duck, 772 in quail, and 690 in the chimera embryos. The number of motor neurons in the chimera embryos is not significantly different from that in the normal quail. In other words, in spite of reduced peripheral competition <BrainRegion>trochlear</BrainRegion> motor neuron death of normal magnitude occurred. Lack of increased cell survival in our study suggests that <BrainRegion>trochlear</BrainRegion> motor neurons do not compete for survival at the peripheral target.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Differential localization of NMDA and AMPA receptor subunits in the <BrainRegion>lateral and basal nuclei of the amygdala</BrainRegion>: a light and electron microscopic study.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Anatomical and physiological studies indicate that the amino acid L-glutamate is the excitatory transmitter in sensory afferent pathways to the <BrainRegion>amygdala</BrainRegion> and in intraamygdala circuits involving the <BrainRegion>lateral and basal nuclei</BrainRegion>. The regional, cellular, and subcellular immunocytochemical localizations of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and L-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate (AMPA), two major classes of glutamate receptors, were examined in these areas of the <BrainRegion>amygdala</BrainRegion>. A monoclonal antibody and a polyclonal antiserum directed against the R1 subunit of the N-methyl-D-aspartate(NMDA) receptor were used. Each immunoreagent produced distinct distributions of perikaryal and neuropilar staining. Dendritic immunoreactivity was localized primarily to asymmetric (excitatory) synaptic junctions, mostly on spines, consistent with the conventional view of the organization and function of N-methyl-D-aspartate(NMDA) receptors. Whereas the anti- N-methyl-D-aspartate(NMDA) R1 antiserum produced sparse presynaptic axon terminal labeling and extensive glial labeling, the anti- N-methyl-D-aspartate(NMDA) R1 antibody labeled considerably fewer glia and many more presynaptic axon terminals. Labeled presynaptic terminals formed asymmetric and symmetric synapses, suggesting presynaptic regulation of both excitatory and inhibitory transmission. Immunoreactivity for different subunits of the AMPA receptor (GluR1, GluR2/3, and GluR4) was uniquely distributed across neuronal populations, and some receptor subunits were specific to certain cell types. Immunoreactivity for GluR1 and Glu2/3 was predominantely localized to dendritic shafts and was more extensive than that of GluR4 due to heavy labeling of proximal portions of dendrites. The distribution of GluR4 immunoreactivity was similar to N-methyl-D-aspartate(NMDA) R1: GluR4 was seen in presynaptic terminals, glia, and dendrites and was primarily localized to spines. The presynaptic localization of GluR4 in the absence of GluR2 suggests glutamate-mediated modulation of presynaptic Ca++ concentrations. These data add to our understanding of the morphological basis of pre- and postsynaptic transmission mechanisms and synaptic plasticity in the <BrainRegion>amygdala</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Expression, synaptic localization, and developmental regulation of Ack1/Pyk1, a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase highly expressed in the developing and adult brain.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Cytosolic tyrosine kinases play a critical role both in neural development and in adult brain function and plasticity. Here we isolated a cDNA with high homology to human Ack1 and mouse Tnk2. This cDNA directs the expression of a 125-kD protein that can be autophosphorylated in tyrosines. Initially, this clone was named Pyk1 for proline-rich tyrosine kinase (Lev et al., 1995); however, since it corresponds to the mouse homolog of Ack1, here we called it Ack1/Pyk1. In this study we show that Ack1/Pyk1 mRNA and protein is highly expressed in the developing and adult brain. The highest levels of Ack1/Pyk1 expression were detected in the <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>neocortex</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>cerebellum</BrainRegion>. Electron microscopy studies showed that Ack1/Pyk1 protein is expressed in these regions both at dendritic spines and presynaptic axon terminals, indicating a role in synaptic function. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Ack1/Pyk1 mRNA levels are strongly upregulated by increased neural activity, produced by intraperitoneal kainate injections. During development, Ack1/Pyk1 was also expressed in the proliferative <BrainRegion>ventricular zones</BrainRegion> and in postmitotic maturing neurons. In neuronal cultures, Ack1/Pyk1 was detected in developing dendrites and axons, including dendritic tips and growth cones. Moreover, Ack1/Pyk1 colocalized with Cdc42 GTPase in neuronal cultures and coimmunoprecipitated with Cdc42 in HEK 293T cells. Altogether, our findings indicate that Ack1/Pyk1 tyrosine kinase may be involved both in adult synaptic function and plasticity and in brain development.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Development of location-specific hair cell stereocilia in denervated embryonic ears.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The developmental mechanisms that allow physiological coding of acoustic pitch have remained unexplained. Cochlear hair cells that have different structures respond to different sound frequencies and synapse with neurons that project to different locations in the brain. How do these hair cells develop appropriate structures, and how are the connections between specific hair cells and the neurons that code for their pitch sensitivities matched? We have investigated one aspect of this by denervating embryonic chicken ears, before the time of hair cell production, and then transplanting them to the aneural chorioallantoic membrane of host embryos where they have continued to develop. We report that vestibular and auditory hair cell phenotypes differentiate appropriately and that correct gradients of hair cell structural phenotypes, as expressed in stereocilia bundles, develop in the <BrainRegion>cochleae</BrainRegion> of these denervated ears. Therefore, the normal development of gradients in hair cell stereocilia properties must be controlled by location-specific cues originating in the ear itself. Neuronally directed modification of target cell phenotypes is not required for the quite specific phenotype development represented by the stereocilia bundles of individual hair cells and the connectional matching in the numerous distinct peripheral information lines of the auditory system.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Organization of N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptor gene expression in the <BrainRegion>basal ganglia</BrainRegion> of the rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Glutamate is an important neurotransmitter in the circuitry of the <BrainRegion>basal ganglia</BrainRegion>. Of the four pharmacological classes of receptors that may mediate the actions of glutamate, the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) type is of particular interest insofar as it has been implicated in the neural processes underlying long-term synaptic plasticity as well as excitotoxic injury. N-methyl-D-aspartate(NMDA) ligand binding sites are abundant in the structures of the <BrainRegion>basal ganglia</BrainRegion>, and N-methyl-D-aspartate(NMDA) receptors have been linked to neuronal excitability, neuropeptide gene expression, and regulation of dopamine release in these regions. N-methyl-D-aspartate(NMDA) receptors are believed to be heterooligomers of subunits from two families: N-methyl-D-aspartate(NMDA) R1, encoded by a single gene but alternatively spliced to produce eight distinct isoforms ( N-methyl-D-aspartate(NMDA) R1A-H), and N-methyl-D-aspartate(NMDA) R2, encoded by four separate genes ( N-methyl-D-aspartate(NMDA) R2A-D). We have used in situ hybridization with a total of 13 oligonucleotide probes to examine the expression of these genes in the rat <BrainRegion>basal ganglia</BrainRegion>. N-methyl-D-aspartate(NMDA) R1 subunits are expressed throughout the <BrainRegion>basal ganglia</BrainRegion> as well as in the rest of the brain; however, the alternatively spliced amino-terminal region Insertion I is abundantly expressed only in the <BrainRegion>subthalamic nucleus</BrainRegion> and is not detectable in the <BrainRegion>neostriatum</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>globus pallidus</BrainRegion>, or <BrainRegion>substantia nigra pars compacta</BrainRegion>. In contrast, expression of the carboxy terminus segment Deletion I is prominent in the <BrainRegion>striatum</BrainRegion> but is not observed in other elements of the <BrainRegion>basal ganglia</BrainRegion>. N-methyl-D-aspartate(NMDA) R2 subunits also exhibit differential expression: N-methyl-D-aspartate(NMDA) R2B is abundant in the <BrainRegion>striatum</BrainRegion>, but N-methyl-D-aspartate(NMDA) R2A is present within the <BrainRegion>striatum</BrainRegion> only at low levels. N-methyl-D-aspartate(NMDA) R2C is present in the <BrainRegion>substantia nigra pars compacta</BrainRegion> only, while N-methyl-D-aspartate(NMDA) R2D exhibits an unusual distribution, with high levels of expression in the <BrainRegion>substantia nigra pars compacta</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>subthalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>globus pallidus</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>ventral pallidum</BrainRegion>. Since each isoform of the N-methyl-D-aspartate(NMDA) R1 and N-methyl-D-aspartate(NMDA) R2 subunits can confer distinct properties on the resultant N-methyl-D-aspartate(NMDA) receptor, these data imply that there is a high degree of regional specialization in the properties of N-methyl-D-aspartate(NMDA) receptors within the <BrainRegion>basal ganglia</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>NADPH-diaphorase neurons in the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> of the hamster.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>NADPH-diaphorase-positive neurons have been demonstrated in the inner nuclear layer and ganglion cell layer of the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> of different mammalian species, but so far no experiments have been conducted to identify whether these cells are amacrine cells and/or <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> ganglion cells. We attempted to solve this problem by studying the NADPH-diaphorase-positive neurons in the hamster <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>. From the NADPH-diaphorase histochemical reaction, two distinct types of neurons in the hamster <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> were identified. They were named ND(g) and ND(i) cells. The ND(g) cells were cells with larger somata, ranging from 10 to 21 microns in diameter with a mean of 15.58 microns (S.D. = 2.59). They were found in the ganglion cell layer only. The ND(i) cells were smaller, with the somata ranging from 7 to 11 microns and having the mean diameter of 8.77 microns (S.D. = 1.24). Most of the ND(i) cells were found in the inner nuclear layer, and only very few could be observed in the inner plexiform layer. On average, there were 8,033 ND(g) and 5,051 ND(i) cells in the ganglion cell layer and inner nuclear layer, respectively. Two experiments were performed to clarify whether any of the NADPH-diaphorase neurons were <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> ganglion cells. Following unilateral <BrainRegion>optic nerve</BrainRegion> section, which leads to the retrograde degeneration of <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> ganglion cells, the numbers of both ND(g) and ND(i) cells did not change significantly for up to 4 months. In addition, when <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> ganglion cells were prelabeled retrogradely (horseradish peroxidase or fluorescent microspheres) and <BrainRegion>retinas</BrainRegion> were then stained for NADPH diaphorase, no double-labeled neurons were detected. These results indicated that the NADPH-diaphorase neurons in the hamster <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> were the amacrine cells in the inner nuclear layer and displaced amacrine cells in the ganglion cell layer. Dendrites of the ND(g) and ND(i) cells were found to stratify in sublaminae 1, 3, and 5 of the inner plexiform layer, with a prominent staining in the sublamina 5. The possible importance of this arrangement in the rod pathway is also discussed.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Brain stem</BrainRegion> projections of sensory and motor components of the <BrainRegion>vagus complex</BrainRegion> in the cat: I. The <BrainRegion>cervical vagus</BrainRegion> and nodose ganglion.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The motor and sensory connections of the <BrainRegion>cervical vagus nerve</BrainRegion> and of its inferior ganglion (nodose ganglion) have been traced in the <BrainRegion>medulla oblongata</BrainRegion> of 32 adult cats with the neuroanatomical methods of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) histochemistry and amino acid autoradiography (ARG). In 14 of these subjects, an aqueous solution of horseradish peroxidase(HRP) was applied unilaterally to the central end of the severed <BrainRegion>cervical vagus nerve</BrainRegion>. In 13 other cases, horseradish peroxidase(HRP) was injected directly into the nodose ganglion. Three of these 13 subjects had undergone infranodose vagotomy 6 weeks prior to the horseradish peroxidase(HRP) injection. A mixture of tritiated amino acid was injected into the nodose ganglion in five additional cats. The retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase(HRP) yielded reaction product in nerve fibers and perikarya of parasympathetic and somatic motoneurons in the <BrainRegion>medulla oblongata</BrainRegion>. Furthermore, a tetramethyl benzidine (TMB) method for visualizing horseradish peroxidase(HRP) enabled the demonstration of anterograde and transganglionic transport, so that central sensory connections of the nodose ganglion and of the <BrainRegion>vagus nerve</BrainRegion> could also be traced. The central distribution of silver grain following injections of tritiated amino acids in the nodose ganglion corresponded closely with the distribution of sensory projections demonstrated with horseradish peroxidase(HRP) , thus confirming the validity of horseradish peroxidase(HRP) histochemistry as a method for tracing these projections. The histochemical and autoradiographic experiments showed that the <BrainRegion>vagus nerve</BrainRegion> enters the <BrainRegion>medulla</BrainRegion> from its lateral aspect in multiple fascicles and that it contains three major components--axons of preganglionic parasympathetic neurones, axons of skeletal motoneurons, and central processes of the sensory neurons in the nodose ganglion. Retrogradely labeled neurons were seen in the <BrainRegion>dorsal motor nucleus of X</BrainRegion>(dmnX), the <BrainRegion>nucleus ambiguus</BrainRegion> (nA), the <BrainRegion>nucleus retroambigualis</BrainRegion> (nRA), the <BrainRegion>nucleus dorsomedialis</BrainRegion> (ndm) and the <BrainRegion>spinal nucleus of the accessory nerve</BrainRegion> (nspA). The axons arising from motoneurons in the <BrainRegion>nucleus ambiguus</BrainRegion>(nA) did not traverse the <BrainRegion>medulla</BrainRegion> directly laterally; rather, all of these axons were initially directed dorsomedially toward the <BrainRegion>dmnX</BrainRegion>, where they formed a hairpin loop and then accompanied the axons of <BrainRegion>dmnX</BrainRegion> neurons to their points of exit. Afferent fibers in the <BrainRegion>vagus nerve</BrainRegion> reached most of the <BrainRegion>subnuclei of the nTS</BrainRegion> bilaterally, with the more intense labeling being found on the ipsilateral side. Labeling of sensory vagal projections was also found in the <BrainRegion>area postrema</BrainRegion> of both sides and around neurons of the <BrainRegion>dmnX</BrainRegion>. These direct sensory projections terminating within the <BrainRegion>dmnX</BrainRegion> may provide an anatomical substrate for vagally mediated monosynpatic reflexes. Following deefferentiation by infranodose vagotomy 6 weeks prior to horseradish peroxidase(HRP) injections into the nodose ganglion, a number of neurons in the <BrainRegion>dmnX</BrainRegion> were still intensely labeled with the horseradish peroxidase(HRP) reaction product. The axons of these horseradish peroxidase(HRP) -labeled perikarya may constitute the bulbar component of the <BrainRegion>accessory nerve</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>GABA and tyrosine hydroxylase immunocytochemistry reveal different patterns of colocalization in <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> neurons of various vertebrates.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Colocalization of GABA- and tyrosine hydroxylase-like immunoreactivity was studied in the <BrainRegion>retinae</BrainRegion> of various vertebrate species in order to ascertain whether the presumed coexistence of GABA and dopamine, reported earlier for mammals (Kosaka et al.: Exp. Brain Res. 66:191-210, &apos;87: Wässle and Chun: J. Neurosci. 8:3383-3394,'88) is a common phenomenon. GABA-immunopositive cells constituted a separate population from tyrosine hydroxylase-positive cells in fish and amphibians, whilst in higher--i.e., amniote--vertebrates, such as reptiles, birds, and mammals, all dopaminergic cells contained GABA-like immunoreactivity. No clear correlation was found between the type of dopaminergic cell (amacrine/interplexiform) and the presence or absence of colocalization.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Cholecystokinin innervation of monkey <BrainRegion>prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion>: an immunohistochemical study.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Knowledge of the circuitry of chemically identified systems in primate <BrainRegion>prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion> is limited. Although cholecystokinin is very abundant in <BrainRegion>prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion> (Geola et al.: Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism 53(2):270-275, 1981; Taquet et al.: Neuroscience 27(3):871-883, 1988), the organization of cholecystokinin-containing structures in primate <BrainRegion>prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion> has not been investigated. Using immunohistochemical and retrograde transport techniques, we characterized the cholecystokinin innervation of <BrainRegion>prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion> in macaque monkeys. The use of two antibodies directed against different portions of the cholecystokinin molecule revealed that distinct forms of the molecule were differentially localized in the same <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> neurons. These small, nonpyramidal cholecystokinin-positive neurons had a variety of somal morphologies and the density of labeled cells did not differ among cytoarchitectonic regions. Labeled neurons had a distinctive laminar distribution with the greatest density of cells present in layers II-superficial III. Labeled fibers also had a distinctive laminar pattern of distribution that differed from that of the immunoreactive neurons. In <BrainRegion>granular prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion>, terminal fields were evident in layers II, IV, and VI, with the greatest density in layer VI. <BrainRegion>Agranular area 24</BrainRegion> exhibited a bilaminar pattern of immunoreactivity with a band in layer II and a very dense terminal field in layers V-VI. A high density of cholecystokinin-binding sites has been found in layers III-IV of <BrainRegion>prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion> and other <BrainRegion>association areas</BrainRegion> in the monkey; this finding has been attributed to possible cholecystokinin-containing afferents from the <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion> (Kritzer et al.: Journal of Comparative Neurology 263:418-435, 1987). The <BrainRegion>mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus</BrainRegion> is known to be a source of afferents which terminate in layer IV of <BrainRegion>prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion>. However, combined retrograde transport and immunohistochemical techniques failed to reveal the presence of cholecystokinin-positive neurons in the <BrainRegion>mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus</BrainRegion> that project to <BrainRegion>prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion>. These findings, and other observations, suggest that the terminal field in layer IV is formed by descending axons that arise from cholecystokinin-containing neurons in layers II and superficial III. This study demonstrates that the cholecystokinin innervation of <BrainRegion>prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion> has a laminar specific organization that is preserved across cytoarchitectonic regions. This distribution of immunoreactive structures suggests a distinctive role of cholecystokinin in <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> circuitry that is common to every region of <BrainRegion>prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Two N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors in rat dorsal root ganglia with different subunit composition and localization.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in sensory afferents participate in chronic pain by mediating peripheral and central sensitization. We studied the presence of N-methyl-D-aspartate(NMDA) receptor subunits in different types of primary afferents. Western blots indicated that rat dorsal root ganglia (DRG) contain NR1, NR2B, NR2C, and NR2D but not NR2A. Real-time RT-PCR showed that NR2B and NR2D were expressed at higher levels than NR2A and NR2C in dorsal root ganglia(DRG) . Immunofluorescence with an antibody that recognized NR1 and another that recognized NR2A and NR2B showed that NR1 and NR2B colocalized in 90% of dorsal root ganglia(DRG) neurons, including most A-fibers (identified by the presence of neurofilament 200 kDa). In contrast, an antibody recognizing NR2C and NR2D labeled only neurofilament-negative dorsal root ganglia(DRG) profiles. This antibody stained practically all dorsal root ganglia(DRG) cells that contained calcitonin gene-related peptide and neurokinins and those that bound isolectin B4. The percentage of cells immunoreactive for NR1, NR2A/NR2B, and NR2C/NR2D were the same in the T9, T12, L4, and L6 dorsal root ganglia(DRG) . The intracellular distribution of the NR2 subunits was strikingly different: Whereas NR2A/NR2B immunoreactivity was found in the Golgi apparatus and occasionally at the plasma membrane, NR2C/NR2D immunoreactivity was found in the cytoplasm but not in the Golgi. The NR1 subunit was present throughout the cytoplasm and was more intense in the Golgi. These findings indicate that dorsal root ganglia(DRG) neurons have two different N-methyl-D-aspartate(NMDA) receptors, one containing the NR1, NR2D, and possibly the NR2C subunits, found only in C-fibers, and the diheteromer NR1/NR2B, present in the Golgi apparatus of both A- and C-fibers.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Dopamine-like immunoreactivity in the brain and suboesophageal ganglion of the honeybee.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The distribution of dopamine in the brain and suboesophageal ganglion of the honeybee Apis mellifera was investigated by means of immunocytochemistry with a well-characterized antiserum against dopamine. The binding of the antiserum in paraffin serial sections was studied with the peroxidase-antiperoxidase method. Dopamine-like immunoreactive neurons are present in most parts of the brain and in the suboesophageal ganglion. Only the <BrainRegion>optic lobes</BrainRegion> are devoid of label. There are ca. 330 dopamine immunoreactive somata in each brain hemisphere plus respective suboesophageal hemiganglion, which is less than 0.1% of the entire neuronal population. Most of the labelled somata are situated within three clusters: one below the <BrainRegion>lateral calyx</BrainRegion> and two in the <BrainRegion>anterior-ventral protocerebrum</BrainRegion>. Other labelled somata lie dispersed or in small groups around the <BrainRegion>protocerebral bridge</BrainRegion>, below the <BrainRegion>optic tubercles</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>proximal to the ventral rim of the lobula</BrainRegion>, and in the lateral and ventral somatal rind of the <BrainRegion>suboesophageal</BrainRegion> ganglion. Similar to neurons that react with an antiserum against serotonin, the fine processes of dopamine immunoreactive fibers have a varicose appearance which is typical for aminergic neurons. In addition to the neuronal staining, dopamine-like immunoreactivity is also present in the sheath surrounding the brain and in the retina, where it is not restricted to any particular cell type. A detailed account is given for those neurons and groups of neurons that could be traced and reconstructed in some detail. A common feature of all dopamine immunoreactive fibers is that each fiber invades large volumes of neuropil, suggesting that dopamine is more important in mediating distant rather than local neural interactions.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Numbers of synapses in laminae I-IV of the rat <BrainRegion>dorsal horn</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The present study determines numerical densities (NVsyn) and total numbers of synaptic discs in laminae I-IV of the rat S2 <BrainRegion>dorsal horn</BrainRegion>. Previous methods for NVsyn have the advantage of being relatively simple, but these assume that the discs are round, flat, and of uniform size. In our material, serial reconstructions indicate that these assumptions are not met. Accordingly we use a stereological method that is not as dependent on these assumptions. This method is to divide the surface density of the discs by the mean surface area of a disc (NVsyn = SVsyn/Ssyn). We refer to this as a reconstruction method because synaptic discs are reconstructed from serial sections. We also calculate numerical densities by several previously used standard methods, and the findings are similar but not identical. We find that numerical density and total synaptic numbers are smallest in lamina I, and densities and total numbers are not significantly different when lamina II is compared to laminae III and IV. Thus the intense labeling of terminals with certain compounds that characterize lamina I and II does not imply an increase in total synaptic numbers or in synaptic density. In addition there is a general increase in synaptic densities and numbers as one proceeds from lamina I to lamina IV. Another point is that the numerical density of synapses in the <BrainRegion>dorsal horn</BrainRegion> is approximately that of the <BrainRegion>cerebral cortex</BrainRegion>. These data will serve as a basis from which to judge the effects of denervations and other manipulations that purportedly change synaptic numbers.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>G protein subunit G gamma 13 is coexpressed with G alpha o, G beta 3, and G beta 4 in retinal ON bipolar cells.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>We investigated the expression of Ggamma13, a recently discovered G protein subunit, and a selection of Gbeta subunits in <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> bipolar cells, by using a transgenic mouse strain in which green fluorescent protein is strongly expressed in a single type of cone bipolar cell. The cells have ON morphology, and patch-clamp recordings in slices confirmed that they are of the physiological ON type. Immunohistochemistry showed that Ggamma13 is expressed in rod bipolar cells and ON cone bipolar cells, where it is colocalized in the dendrites with Galphaomicron. ON and OFF cone bipolar cells and rod bipolar cells were identified among dissociated cells by their green fluorescence and/or distinct morphology. Hybridization of single-cell polymerase chain reaction products with cDNA probes for G protein subunits Gbeta1 to 5 showed that Gbeta3, Gbeta4, and Ggamma13 are coexpressed in ON bipolar cells but not present in OFF bipolar cells. Gbeta1, 2, and 5 are expressed in partially overlapping subpopulations of cone bipolar cells. Ggamma13 and Gbeta3 and/or Gbeta4, thus, seem selectively to participate in signal transduction by ON bipolar cells.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Expression of cadherin-8 mRNA in the developing mouse central nervous system.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The expression of cadherin-8 was mapped by in situ hybridization in the embryonic and postnatal mouse central nervous system (CNS). From embryonic day 18 (E18) to postnatal day 6 (P6), cadherin-8 expression is restricted to a subset of developing brain nuclei and <BrainRegion>cortical areas</BrainRegion> in all major subdivisions of the central nervous system(CNS) . The anlagen of some of the cadherin-8-positive structures also express this molecule at earlier developmental stages (E12.5-E16). The cadherin-8-positive neuroanatomical structures are parts of several functional systems in the brain. In the <BrainRegion>limbic system</BrainRegion>, cadherin-8-positive regions are found in the <BrainRegion>septal region</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>habenular nuclei</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>amygdala</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>interpeduncular nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>raphe nuclei</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion>. <BrainRegion>Cerebral cortex</BrainRegion> shows expression in several <BrainRegion>limbic areas</BrainRegion> at postnatal day 6(P6) . In the <BrainRegion>basal ganglia</BrainRegion> and related nuclei, cadherin-8 is expressed by parts of the <BrainRegion>striatum</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>globus pallidus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>substantia nigra</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>entopeduncular nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>subthalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>zona incerta</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>pedunculopontine nuclei</BrainRegion>. A third group of cadherin-8-positive gray matter structures has functional connections with the <BrainRegion>cerebellum</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>anterior pretectal nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>red nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>nucleus of posterior commissure</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>inferior olive</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>pontine</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>pontine reticular</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>vestibular nuclei</BrainRegion>). The <BrainRegion>cerebellum</BrainRegion> itself shows parasagittal stripes of cadherin-8 expression in the Purkinje cell layer. In the <BrainRegion>hindbrain</BrainRegion>, cadherin-8 is expressed by several <BrainRegion>cranial nerve nuclei</BrainRegion>. Results from this study show that cadherin-8 expression in the embryonic and postnatal mouse brain is restricted to specific developing gray matter structures. These data support the idea that cadherins are a family of molecules whose expression provides a molecular code for the regionalization of the developing vertebrate brain.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Species differences in electric organs of mormyrids: substrates for species-typical electric organ discharge waveforms.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The organization of electric organs is described for the mormyrid fishes from Africa. The electric organ&apos;s spike-generating cells or electrocytes are wafer-shaped cells with a special geometry that relates to the number of phases and polarity of their pulsatile electric organ discharge (EOD) waveform. Six "families" of electrocytes are recognized on the basis of cell geometry. Each family includes species with electric organ discharge(EOD) s of similar polarity and phase number. Despite such similarities, there are still dramatic species differences in electric organ discharge(EOD) waveforms for a given family that may further depend on specialized features of the electrocyte's excitable membranes. It is each species' particular electrocyte "profile" that must underlie the development of species-specific and hormone-dependent sex differences in the electric organ discharge(EOD) waveforms.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>&quot;Satellite cells" and nerve terminals in the crayfish opener muscle visualized with fluorescent dyes.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Nerve terminals and associated cells on the muscle&apos;s surface were visualized in the crayfish opener muscle with several fluorescent dyes in conjunction with confocal microscopy and conventional fluorescence microscopy. The nerve terminals of the excitatory and inhibitory axons were best seen with 4-diethylaminostyryl-N-methylpyridinium iodide (4-Di-2-Asp). This dye is selectively accumulated in mitochondria, which are numerous both in the axons and in synapse-bearing terminal varicosities. Muscle nuclei were also clearly visualized, because they excluded 4-Di-2-Asp but were stained by acridine orange (AO). A positive attraction between muscle nuclei and nerve terminals was evident by visual inspection and was confirmed by spatial statistics. Additional flat cells on the muscle's surface appeared as bright rings with elongated processes that were often close to or overlapped nearby nerve terminals. The structure of these cells was established by electron microscopy after labeling them with fluorescent polystyrene beads, which could be found over structures on the muscle surface in sections of embedded specimens. The flat surface cells were distinct from peripheral glial cells closely associated with axons and nerve terminals. Nevertheless, spatial statistics showed that the surface cells were grouped near nerve terminals. They occupied a small fraction of the muscle cell's surface. Their functional role has not been determined in crustacean muscles.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Oxytocinergic innervation of the brain of the garden dormouse (Eliomys quercinus L.).</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The oxytocinergic innervation of the brain of the garden dormouse (Eliomys quercinus L.) was studied by means of immunocytochemistry. In contrast to the sparse oxytocin innervation of the rat <BrainRegion>forebrain</BrainRegion>, dense fibre networks in various <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>limbic brain areas</BrainRegion> were demonstrated in this animal. These include, e.g., the <BrainRegion>prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>claustrum</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>septum</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion>. A very dense innervation was also seen in the caudal regions of the garden dormouse brain; these regions are already known to have a relatively dense oxytocin fibre network in the rat. A dense innervation of oxytocin fibres is seen in several brain regions which, in the rat, have oxytocin binding sites but no visible oxytocin innervation. This discrepancy suggests that the differences in the oxytocinergic innervation of these two rodent brains may be due to an oxytocin system in the rat brain that is more difficult to detect immunocytochemically.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Topographic organization of tufted cell axonal projections in the hamster main <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>: an intrabulbar associational system.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The organization of intrinsic axonal projections of principal neurons in the <BrainRegion>main olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> (MOB) was studied in hamsters by using wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) and fluorescent dyes. Punctate injections of either wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase(WGA-HRP) or fast blue (FB) that are restricted to small sectors on one side of the <BrainRegion>main olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>(MOB) produce comparably restricted fields of retrograde labeling on the opposite side. Label is found predominantly in superficially situated (middle and external) tufted cells that lie near and at the border between the external plexiform and glomerular layers. Few of the deeper middle tufted, internal tufted, or mitral cells and no external tufted cells that lie in the superficial two-thirds of the glomerular layer are labeled in regions remote to the injection site. Anterograde transport of wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase(WGA-HRP) from the injection site labels axons that travel dorsally and ventrally in restricted bands through the internal plexiform layer and then terminate within this layer in the punctate sector on the opposite side that contains retrogradely labeled neurons. Such reciprocal projections between opposing regions of the <BrainRegion>medial and lateral sides of the main olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>(MOB) are found at all rostrocaudal and dorsoventral levels. When punctate injections of fast blue(FB) into the <BrainRegion>main olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>(MOB) are paired with restricted injections of a second fluorescent tracer (nuclear yellow or diamidino yellow dihydrochloride) into the appropriate sector of <BrainRegion>pars externa (pE) of the anterior olfactory nucleus</BrainRegion>, the punctate region of remote retrogradely labeled principal neurons is embedded within a topographically restricted longitudinal wedge of retrogradely labeled mitral and tufted cells that project extrinsically to or through pars externa(pE) . However, extremely few of these neurons are double-retrogradely labeled. The results reveal the existence of an intrabulbar associational system in which principal neurons engage in point-to-point, reciprocal projections between opposing regions of the <BrainRegion>medial and lateral main olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>(MOB) . Moreover, the results indicate that this associational system largely arises from superficially situated tufted cells distinct from those that support bulbofugal projections into the topographically organized interbulbar commissural system via <BrainRegion>pars externa</BrainRegion>(pE) .</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Distinct subpopulations of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) containing sympathetic preganglionic neurons in spontaneously hypertensive and Wistar-Kyoto rats.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The sympathetic preganglionic neurons (SPN) of the intermediolateral cell column (IML) play a critical role in the maintenance of vascular tone. We undertook a comparative neuroanatomical analysis of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) expression in the sympathetic preganglionic neurons(SPN) of the mature normotensive Wistar Kyoto (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR). The anatomical relationship between neuronal nitric oxide synthase(nNOS) and the NO signaling molecule cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) was also determined. All animals were male, age &amp;gt; 6 months. Fluorogold (FG) retrograde labeling of sympathetic preganglionic neurons(SPN) (detected with immunohistochemistry) was combined with NADPH-diaphorase histochemistry for NOS in the <BrainRegion>thoracic spinal cord</BrainRegion> (T1-11, n = 5 Wistar Kyoto(WKY) , 5 spontaneously hypertensive rat(SHR) ). There was no difference in the total number of Fluorogold(FG) -labeled sympathetic preganglionic neurons(SPN) ( Wistar Kyoto(WKY) 6,542 +/- 828, spontaneously hypertensive rat(SHR) 6,091 +/- 820), but the proportion of Fluorogold(FG) -labeled cells expressing NOS was significantly less in the spontaneously hypertensive rat(SHR) ( Wistar Kyoto(WKY) 64.4 +/- 5.1 vs. spontaneously hypertensive rat(SHR) 55.6 +/- 2.1, P &amp;lt; 0.05). Fluorescence immunohistochemistry for neuronal nitric oxide synthase(nNOS) / cyclic guanosine monophosphate(cGMP) (n = 4 Wistar Kyoto(WKY) , 4 spontaneously hypertensive rat(SHR) ) was also performed. Confocal microscopy revealed that all neuronal nitric oxide synthase(nNOS) -positive sympathetic preganglionic neurons(SPN) contain cyclic guanosine monophosphate(cGMP) and confirmed a strain-specific anatomical arrangement of sympathetic preganglionic neurons(SPN) cell clusters. A novel subpopulation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate(cGMP) -only cells were also identified. Double labeling for cyclic guanosine monophosphate(cGMP) and choline acetyltransferase (n = 3 Wistar Kyoto(WKY) , 3 spontaneously hypertensive rat(SHR) ), confirmed these cells as sympathetic preganglionic neurons(SPN) in both Wistar Kyoto(WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive rat(SHR) . These results suggest that cyclic guanosine monophosphate(cGMP) is a key signaling molecule in sympathetic preganglionic neurons(SPN) , and that a reduced number of NOS neurons in the spontaneously hypertensive rat(SHR) may play a role in the increase in sympathetic tone associated with hypertension in these animals.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Neurotensin: topographical distribution in rat brain by immunohistochemistry.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The anatomical distribution of neurotensin perikarya and fibers in rat brain, <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>pituitary</BrainRegion> has been studied by immunohistochemistry. Neurotensin immunoreactivity is widely distributed throughout the brain, especially in <BrainRegion>forebrain</BrainRegion> and midbrain <BrainRegion>limbic structures</BrainRegion>, but also in the <BrainRegion>pons</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>medulla</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>. Areas with low immunoreactivity, or lack of it, stand out and include most of the <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>isocortex</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>ventromedial and dorsomedial hypothalamic nuclei</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>somatomotor nuclei</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>cerebellum</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>dorsal column nuclei</BrainRegion>. Strong neurotensin immunoreactivity is found in <BrainRegion>accumbens-caudate-putamen</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>central and medial amygdaloid nuclei</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>ventrolateral septum</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>pars lateralis of the nucleus of the stria terminalis</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>paraventricular, periventricular, and lateral hypothalamus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>median eminence</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>thalamic intralaminar and periventricular nuclei</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>ventral tegmentum</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>central gray</BrainRegion>, certain <BrainRegion>raphe nuclei</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>locus ceruleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>nucleus parabrachialis medialis and lateralis</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>area postrema</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>spinal and trigeminal substantia gelatinosa</BrainRegion>, as well as certain cells in the <BrainRegion>anterior pituitary</BrainRegion>. The anatomical data suggest the existence of neurotensin circuits for (1) the control of autonomic-endocrine functions, involving the <BrainRegion>nucleus tractus solitarii</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>area postrema</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>nucleus ambiguus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>nucleus parabrachialis</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>nucleus paraventricularis</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>nucleus centralis amygdalae</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>pars lateralis of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis</BrainRegion>; and (2) for the transmission and modulation of certain somatosensory qualities, involving the <BrainRegion>spinal substantia gelatinosa</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>trigeminal sensory nuclei</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>thalamic intralaminar nuclei</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Ultrastructural localization of tyrosine hydroxylase in rat <BrainRegion>nucleus accumbens</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Immunocytochemical localization of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) was used to determine the ultrastructural morphology and synaptic associations of catecholaminergic terminals in the <BrainRegion>nucleus accumbens</BrainRegion> of the rat. The brains were fixed by vascular perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.2% glutaraldehyde. Coronal sections cut with a vibrating microtome were incubated with rabbit antiserum to tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) then immunocytochemically labeled by the peroxidase-antiperoxidase method. Immunoreactivity for the enzyme was found within unmyelinated axons and axon terminals. These terminals contained either all small clear or combined small clear and large dense core vesicles. Approximately 40% of the labeled terminals formed symmetric synapses with unlabeled proximal or distal dendritic shafts. The dendrites showed a spare distribution of spines. Axosomatic synapses and axonal associations of the tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) -containing terminals also were detected. The recipient perikarya were usually 10-20 micrometers in diameter and contained an indented nucleus and abundant cytoplasm. The content of large dense vesicles and synaptic associations with somata and proximal dendrites suggest that a certain proportion of the tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) -containing terminals within the <BrainRegion>nucleus accumbens</BrainRegion> are morphologically distinct from catecholaminergic terminals within the <BrainRegion>dorsal striatum</BrainRegion>. These differences are discussed in relation to neuropeptides and functions of the dopaminergic <BrainRegion>mesolimbic</BrainRegion> and nigrostriatal pathways.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Premotor circuits controlling eyelid movements in conjunction with vertical saccades in the cat: I. The <BrainRegion>rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Saccadic eye movements in the vertical plane are controlled by the <BrainRegion>rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus</BrainRegion> (riMLF) and the <BrainRegion>interstitial nucleus of Cajal</BrainRegion>. Eye movements in the vertical direction are accompanied by concurrent upper eye lid movements. These gaze-related lid movements are produced by the levator palpebrae superioris muscle, whose motoneurons are located in the <BrainRegion>caudal central subdivision (CCS) of the oculomotor nucleus</BrainRegion>. The neural circuits that direct such gaze-related lid movements were examined by use of both conventional and dual neuronal tracing methods in the cat. Injections of wheat germ agglutinin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) into the area of the <BrainRegion>caudal central subdivision</BrainRegion>(CCS) revealed a distinctive subset of retrogradely labeled neurons located in the <BrainRegion>caudomedial portion of the rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus</BrainRegion>(riMLF) . This subset of <BrainRegion>rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus</BrainRegion>(riMLF) neurons was not labeled when injections were localized within the <BrainRegion>oculomotor nucleus proper</BrainRegion>, without involving the <BrainRegion>caudal central subdivision</BrainRegion>(CCS) . Injections of biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) that included this <BrainRegion>caudomedial rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus</BrainRegion>(riMLF) region anterogradely labeled axons that projected profusely throughout the <BrainRegion>caudal central subdivision</BrainRegion>(CCS) . Labeled terminals were seen in close association with retrogradely labeled levator palpebrae motoneurons, which were primarily found contralateral to wheat germ agglutinin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase(WGA-HRP) muscle injections. Ultrastructural examination revealed that most biotinylated dextran amine(BDA) -labeled terminals contained clear spherical vesicles and formed asymmetrical synaptic contacts, primarily on the proximal dendrites of wheat germ agglutinin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase(WGA-HRP) -labeled motoneurons. A few had pleiomorphic vesicles. In summary, these results strongly suggest that the caudomedial part of the cat <BrainRegion>rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus</BrainRegion>(riMLF) is a <BrainRegion>premotor center</BrainRegion> that monosynaptically controls lid movements in conjunction with vertical saccades.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Development of motoneurons and primary sensory afferents in the thoracic and lumbar spinal cord of the South American opossum Monodelphis domestica.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The postnatal development of the primary sensory afferent projection to the thoracic (T4) and lumbar (L4) spinal cord of the marsupial species Monodelphis domestica was studied by using anterograde and retrograde neuronal tracers. Large numbers of primary afferents and motoneurons were labelled by application of the carbocyanine dye DiI into individual dorsal root ganglia (DRG) afferents in short-term organ cultures. Dorsal root axons had entered the cord at birth, but most primary afferent innervation of the grey matter and the establishment of cytoarchitectural lamination occurs postnatally. In addition to ipsilateral projections, some primary afferents that projected to the dorsal horn extended across the midline into the equivalent contralateral regions of the grey matter. Similarly, motoneuron dendrites occasionally extended across midline and into the contralateral grey matter. The first fibres innervating the spinal cord project to the ventral horn and formed increasingly complex terminal arbours in the motor columns between P1 and P7. After P5 many afferents were seen projecting to the dorsal horn, with the superficial dorsal horn being the last region of the spinal grey to be innervated. Histochemical labelling with the lectin Griffonia simplicifolia indicated that C fibre primary afferents had arborised in the superficial dorsal horn by P14. The sequence of primary afferent innervation is thus similar to that described in the rat, but this sequence occurs over a period of several weeks in Monodelphis, compared with several days in the rat.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Presence of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone fragments in the rhesus monkey <BrainRegion>forebrain</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Previously, we have shown that two types of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) -like neurons, &quot;early" and "late" cells, were discernible in the <BrainRegion>forebrain</BrainRegion> of rhesus monkey fetuses by using antiserum GF-6, which cross-reacts with several forms of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone(LHRH) . The &quot;late" cells that arose from the <BrainRegion>olfactory placode</BrainRegion> of monkey fetuses at embryonic days (E) 32-E36, are bona fide luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone(LHRH) neurons. The &quot;early" cells were found in the <BrainRegion>forebrain</BrainRegion> at E32-E34 and settled in the <BrainRegion>extrahypothalamic area</BrainRegion>. The molecular form of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone(LHRH) in &quot;early" cells differs from "late" cells, because "early" cells were not immunopositive with any specific antisera against known forms of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone(LHRH) . In this study, we investigated the molecular form of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone(LHRH) in the "early" cells in the nasal regions and brains of 13 monkey fetuses at E35 to E78. In situ hybridization studies suggested that both "early" and "late" luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone(LHRH) cells expressed mammalian luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone(LHRH) mRNA. Furthermore, "early" cells predominantly contain luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone(LHRH) 1-5-like peptide and its cleavage enzyme, metalloendopeptidase E.C.3.4.24.15 (EP24.15), which cleaves luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone(LHRH) at the Tyr5-Gly6 position. This conclusion was based on immunocytochemical labeling with various antisera, including those against luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone(LHRH) 1-5, luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone(LHRH) 4-10, or EP24.15, and on preabsorption tests. Therefore, in primates, a group of neurons containing mammalian luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone(LHRH) mRNA arises at an early embryonic stage before the migration of bona fide luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone(LHRH) neurons, and is ultimately distributed in the extrahypothalamic region. These extrahypothalamic neurons contain luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone(LHRH) fragments, rather than fully mature mammalian luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone(LHRH) . The origin and function of these neurons remain to be determined.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Development of retinopetal projections in the cichlid fish, Herotilapia multispinosa.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>This paper reports a study of the development of cells that project to the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> from the <BrainRegion>telencephalic nucleus olfactoretinalis</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>diencephalon</BrainRegion>. Stell et al. (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81:940-944, &apos;84) have shown that the FMRFamide-immunoreactive (FMRFamide-ir) cells in the <BrainRegion>nucleus olfactoretinalis</BrainRegion> project to the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>. Therefore, we used immunocytochemistry to study the development of these cells in the <BrainRegion>nucleus olfactoretinalis</BrainRegion>. Twenty hours after fry hatched, FMRFamide-ir cells were unambiguously seen in the <BrainRegion>nucleus olfactoretinalis</BrainRegion>. At this time the axons of these cells could be traced into the <BrainRegion>optic nerve</BrainRegion>. A few hours later the axons were visible in the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> and soon attained their adult position in the inner plexiform layer near the amacrine cells. In older frey, tracers were used to fill retinopetal cells in both the <BrainRegion>nucleus olfactoretinalis</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>diencephalon</BrainRegion>. Counts of these cells demonstrated that over one-third of the adult number of retinopetal cells in the <BrainRegion>nucleus olfactoretinalis</BrainRegion> are present and have axons in the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> when the fry is 9 days old, and the percentage grows to one-half by the time the fry is 1 month old. Development of the retinopetal cells in the <BrainRegion>diencephalon</BrainRegion> lags behind that of the cells in the <BrainRegion>nucleus olfactoretinalis</BrainRegion>. However, about one-third of the adult number extend their axons into the <BrainRegion>optic nerve</BrainRegion> by 1 month of age. These results support our suggestion that the retinopetal cells have axons in the old part of the <BrainRegion>optic nerve</BrainRegion> because these cells were born and extended axons early in the life of the fish.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Distribution of four types of synapse on physiologically identified relay neurons in the <BrainRegion>ventral posterior thalamic nucleus</BrainRegion> of the cat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>This study was aimed at providing quantitative data on the <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> circuitry that underlies the central processing of somatosensory information. Four physiologically identified thalamocortical relay neurons in the <BrainRegion>ventral posterior lateral nucleus</BrainRegion> (VPL) of the cat <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion> were injected with horseradish peroxidase and subjected to quantitative electron microscopy after pre- or postembedding immunostaining for gamma-aminobutyric acid to reveal synaptic terminals of <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> inhibitory neurons. The four cells all had rapidly adapting responses to light mechanical stimuli applied to their receptive fields, which were situated on hairy or glabrous skin or related to a joint. Their dendritic architecture was typical of cells previously described as type I relay cells in <BrainRegion>ventral posterior lateral nucleus</BrainRegion>(VPL) , and they lacked dendritic appendages. Terminals ending in synapses on the injected cells were categorized as RL (ascending afferent), F (inhibitory), PSD (presynaptic dendrite), and RS (mainly corticothalamic) types and were quantified in reconstructions of serial thin sections. RL and F terminals formed the majority of the synapses on proximal dendrites (approximately 50% each). The number of synapses formed by RL terminals declined on intermediate dendrites, but those formed by F terminals remained relatively high, declining to moderate levels (20-30%) on distal dendrites. RS terminals formed moderate numbers of the synapses on intermediate dendrites and the majority (&amp;gt; 60%) of the synapses on distal dendrites. Synapses formed by presynaptic dendrite(PSD) s were concentrated on intermediate dendrites and were few in number (approximately 6%). They formed synaptic triads with F terminals and rarely with RL terminals. On somata, only a few synapses were found, all made by F terminals. The total number of synapses per cell was calculated to be 5,584-8,797, with a density of 0.6-0.9 per micrometer of dendritic length. Of the total, RL terminals constituted approximately 15%, F terminals approximately 35%, presynaptic dendrite(PSD) terminals approximately 5%, and RS terminals approximately 50%. These results provide the first quantitative assessment of the synaptic architecture of <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> somatic sensory relay neurons and show the basic organizational pattern exhibited by representatives of the physiological type of relay neurons most commonly encountered in the <BrainRegion>ventral posterior lateral nucleus</BrainRegion>(VPL) nucleus.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

The cytoarchitectonic organization of the rat <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> was found to be basically similar to that of the cat, although certain differences exist--for example, in the extension of the laminae. In addition to the laminar scheme, the distribution of certain cell groups, Lissauer&apos;s tract, and the pyramidal tract were investigated.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>The location of <BrainRegion>spinal</BrainRegion> neurons with long descending axons (long descending propriospinal tract neurons) in the cat: a study with the horseradish peroxidase technique.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The distribution <BrainRegion>spinal</BrainRegion> neurons with long descending axons was studied in the cat by means of retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase. Labeled neurons appeared bilaterally in the <BrainRegion>cervical and the thoracic cord</BrainRegion> following injections in the <BrainRegion>lumbosacral cord</BrainRegion>. In some cases hemisections were made rostrally and contralaterally to the injections in an attempt to determine whether or not the axons crossed. Neurons with uncrossed descending axons were located in laminae I, V, VII and VIII. Lamina I neurons were present in all the <BrainRegion>spinal segments</BrainRegion>. In lamina V labeled neurons were distributed mainly laterally in the <BrainRegion>cervical cord</BrainRegion> but medially and laterally in the <BrainRegion>thoracic cord</BrainRegion>. In the <BrainRegion>upper cervical and the thoracic cord</BrainRegion> laminae VII and VIII neurons were distributed very densely along the <BrainRegion>lateral cord</BrainRegion>, accounting for 30 and 40 of the total labeled neurons, respectively. In the cervical enlargement they were located in the middle part of lamina VII and in lamina VIII, accounting for about 25% of the total labeled neurons. Neurons with crossed descending axons were found in laminae V, VII and VIII, in the medial part of lamina VII including the <BrainRegion>intermediomedial nucleus of the thoracic levels</BrainRegion> and close to the <BrainRegion>central canal</BrainRegion>. Lamina V neurons were very small in number. The largest collections of labeled neurons were present in the medial part of laminae VII and VIII. They accounted for about 45% to 55% and 37% of the total in the <BrainRegion>cervical and the thoracic cord</BrainRegion>. These neurons may function as the long spinal reflex paths for <BrainRegion>forelimb-hindlimb</BrainRegion> synergies and the intercalated paths between the supraspinal descending tracts and the <BrainRegion>spinal motor centers</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Central complex</BrainRegion> of the primate <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion>: a quantitative analysis of neuronal morphology.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Neuronal morphology was analyzed in the central complex (centre median-parafascicular complex) of macaques and humans. Cell bodies were described from Nissl material. Golgi-impregnated dendritic arborizations were reconstructed from serial sections and digitized in three dimensions by computer-assisted microscopy. The <BrainRegion>central complex</BrainRegion> was subdivided into three parts on the basis of cytoarchitectonic and hodological criteria: <BrainRegion>pars parafascicularis</BrainRegion> (medial), <BrainRegion>pars media</BrainRegion> (intermediate), and <BrainRegion>pars paralateralis</BrainRegion> (lateral). The mean cross-sectional areas of cell bodies were identical (181 microns2) in the three parts in macaques. In humans they were larger in the <BrainRegion>pars parafascicularis</BrainRegion> (304 microns2) than in the other parts (248 and 240 microns2). Small local circuit neurons were found throughout the complex. Large projection neurons differed statistically in the three parts. In macaques, <BrainRegion>pars parafascicularis</BrainRegion> neurons had few dendritic stems and tips (3-11) and a short total dendritic length (2,000 microns). <BrainRegion>Pars paralateralis</BrainRegion> neurons had more ramified (5-60) and longer (5,800 microns) dendrites. They bore numerous axonlike processes. <BrainRegion>Pars media</BrainRegion> neurons had intermediate characteristics (5-19; 2,400 microns). In humans, <BrainRegion>pars parafascicular</BrainRegion> neurons had similar topological characteristics (3-12) but longer dendrites (3,000 microns) than in the monkey. <BrainRegion>Pars paralateralis</BrainRegion> neurons had more branched (6-71) and longer (9,000 microns) dendrites, with more numerous axonlike processes. <BrainRegion>Pars media</BrainRegion> neurons also had intermediate characteristics (4-25; 3,800 microns). The present study supports a tripartite subdivision of the primate <BrainRegion>central complex</BrainRegion> and demonstrates significant interspecies differences.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Morphology of primary axosomatic endings in the <BrainRegion>anteroventral cochlear nucleus</BrainRegion> of the cat: a study of the <BrainRegion>endbulbs of Held</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The central axons of Type I spiral ganglion neurons travel in the <BrainRegion>auditory nerve</BrainRegion> and terminate in the <BrainRegion>cochlear nucleus</BrainRegion>. The ascending branches of these axons innervate the <BrainRegion>anteroventral cochlear nucleus</BrainRegion> and give rise to large axosomatic endings, called the <BrainRegion>endbulbs of Held</BrainRegion>, and smaller boutons. This paper reports a study of the <BrainRegion>endbulbs of Held</BrainRegion>, stained by horseradish peroxidase and variants of the Golgi method in kittens 2, 5, 10, 20, and 45 days postnatal and adult cats. Endbulbs tend to fall into two extreme groups with some endbulbs having an intermediate appearance; consequently, we have defined three descriptive stages of endbulbs that are conceived of as representing a developmental sequence. One group of endbulbs is found mostly in kittens younger than 10 days postnatal and is similar to the classic description of endbulbs by Ramón y Cajal (&apos;09). The other extreme group of endbulbs is found mostly in adult cats. In these cases, the parent axonal trunk divides into several thick, gnarled branches that in turn branch again, sometimes repeatedly. These branches display irregular varicosities and form a cup-shaped arborization into which the postsynaptic cell body nestles. A chronology of postnatal endbulb development has been inferred from the relative proportions of the different endbulb stages at various ages. Maturation transforms the <BrainRegion>endbulb of Held</BrainRegion> from a large, spoon-shaped swelling having many filipodia into an elaborate tree with broad trunks and many smaller branches. Some implications of the proposed development sequence are discussed.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Tangential distribution of cytochrome oxidase-rich blobs in the <BrainRegion>primary visual cortex</BrainRegion> of macaque monkeys.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>We studied the tangential distribution of cytochrome c oxidase (CytOx)-rich blobs in four <BrainRegion>striate cortices</BrainRegion> of three normal monkeys (Macaca mulatta). The spatial density and cross-sectional area of blobs were analyzed in cytochrome c oxidase(CytOx) -reacted tangential sections of flat-mounted preparations of the <BrainRegion>striate cortex</BrainRegion> (V1). Well-delimited cytochrome c oxidase(CytOx) -rich blobs were found in the middle portion of <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> layer III of the V1. Throughout the binocular field representation, the spatial density of blobs was nearly constant with a mean value of four to five blobs per mm2. In the monocular portions of V1, however, blob spatial density diminished. In all cases, the mean cross-sectional area of blobs was constant in the V1. The small variation of cytochrome c oxidase(CytOx) blob topography with visual field eccentricity contrasts with the variation described in previously published material.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Dense innervation of Deiters&apos; and Hensen's cells persists after chronic deefferentation of guinea pig <BrainRegion>cochleas</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Innervation of Deiters&apos; and Hensen's cells has been described in the <BrainRegion>organ of Corti</BrainRegion> of several mammalian species and has been suggested to arise from the olivocochlear (OC) efferent system (Wright and Preston [1976] Acta Otolaryngol. 82:41-47). In the present study, antineurofilament immunostaining was used to reveal these outer supporting cell fibers (OSCFs) in the normal guinea pig. In control ears, outer supporting cell fibers(OSCFs) were absent in the <BrainRegion>basal half of the cochlea</BrainRegion> but increased in number steadily toward the apex, peaking at values of over 1,200 fibers/mm. These values indicate a far more profuse innervation of supporting cells than has been described previously, suggesting that most outer supporting cell fibers(OSCFs) were not stained in previous immunohistochemical studies. Chronic <BrainRegion>cochlear</BrainRegion> deefferentation was used to test whether outer supporting cell fibers(OSCFs) are part of the olivocochlear(OC) system. The <BrainRegion>olivocochlear(OC) bundle</BrainRegion> was transected unilaterally, and the animals were allowed to survive for 4-8 weeks. Completeness of deefferentation was assessed by using acetylcholinesterase staining of the <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion> and measurement of the density of <BrainRegion>olivocochlear(OC) fascicles</BrainRegion> in the <BrainRegion>cochlea</BrainRegion>. By using these metrics, unilateral deefferentation was nearly complete in three animals. In successfully deefferented cases, the OSCF innervation density was not statistically different from control values. We conclude that the vast majority of outer supporting cell fibers(OSCFs) are not of olivocochlear(OC) origin. We speculate that they may be branches of type II afferent fibers to outer hair cells and that a smaller population of outer supporting cell fibers(OSCFs) with different morphology and immunoreactivity may arise from the olivocochlear(OC) system.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Differential control of <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> activity by the <BrainRegion>basal forebrain</BrainRegion> in rats: a role for both cholinergic and inhibitory influences.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Using microdialysis and high-performance liquid chromatography, we measured acetylcholine (ACh) release simultaneously from two <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> sites in anesthetized rats. One site was always in the <BrainRegion>somatosensory cortex</BrainRegion>, and the other was in either the <BrainRegion>visual or the motor cortex</BrainRegion>. After baseline measurements were obtained, selected sites in the <BrainRegion>basal forebrain</BrainRegion> (BF) were stimulated to increase acetylcholine(ACh) release. Some <BrainRegion>basal forebrain</BrainRegion>(BF) sites provoked more release in one microdialysis probe than in the other, suggesting some degree of corticotropic organization of the cholinergic projections from the <BrainRegion>basal forebrain</BrainRegion>(BF) . <BrainRegion>basal forebrain</BrainRegion>(BF) sites optimal for release from the <BrainRegion>visual cortex</BrainRegion> were separated from optimal sites for release from the <BrainRegion>somatosensory cortex</BrainRegion> by greater distances than were the best sites for release from the <BrainRegion>somatosensory and the motor cortex</BrainRegion>. Stimulation of a single <BrainRegion>basal forebrain</BrainRegion>(BF) site often provoked similar release from the latter two <BrainRegion>cortical areas</BrainRegion>. Electrical stimulation of the <BrainRegion>basal forebrain</BrainRegion>(BF) also modified <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> neuronal activity. Activation of some <BrainRegion>basal forebrain</BrainRegion>(BF) sites provoked an intense discharge of many neurons in the vicinity of the <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> recording electrode, and the same stimulus site in the <BrainRegion>basal forebrain</BrainRegion>(BF) provoked release of large amounts of acetylcholine(ACh) in the <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion>. Stimulation of other <BrainRegion>basal forebrain</BrainRegion>(BF) sites produced strong inhibition of ongoing <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> activity and no increase in <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> acetylcholine(ACh) release. When other sites were stimulated, they had no effect or they generated stereotyped bursting patterns in the <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion> without any observable effect on acetylcholine(ACh) release. <BrainRegion>basal forebrain</BrainRegion>(BF) sites that generated inhibition of <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> neural activity were generally located near the sites that activated the <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion> and provoked release of acetylcholine(ACh) . These data suggest an elaborate control of the <BrainRegion>sensory cortex</BrainRegion> by a mechanism involving both gamma-aminobutyric acid-containing and cholinergic neurons of the <BrainRegion>basal forebrain</BrainRegion>(BF) .</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Projection from the <BrainRegion>accommodation-related area in the superior colliculus</BrainRegion> of the cat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Our previous study has indicated that accommodative responses can be evoked with weak currents applied to a circumscribed area of the <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion> in the cat. We investigated efferent projections from this area with biocytin in the present study. The <BrainRegion>accommodation area in the superior colliculus</BrainRegion> was identified by systematic microstimulation in each of five anesthetized cats. Accommodative responses were detected by an infrared optometer. After mapping the <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion>, biocytin was injected through a glass micropipette into the accommodation area, where accommodative responses were elicited with low-intensity microstimulation. In addition, accommodative responses to stimulation of the <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion> were compared before and after an injection of muscimol, an agonist of inhibitory neurotransmitter, into the <BrainRegion>pretectum</BrainRegion>. Following the injection of biocytin, in the ascending projections, labeled terminals were seen mainly in the <BrainRegion>caudal portion of the nucleus of the optic tract</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the posterior commissure</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>posterior pretectal nucleus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>olivary pretectal nucleus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>mesencephalic reticular formation at the level of the oculomotor nucleus</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>lateral posterior nucleus of the thalamus on the ipsilateral side</BrainRegion>. Less dense terminals were seen in the <BrainRegion>anterior pretectal nucleus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>zona incerta</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>centromedian nucleus of the thalamus</BrainRegion>. In the descending projections, labeled terminals were observed mainly in the <BrainRegion>paramedian pontine reticular formation</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>nucleus raphe interpositus</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>dorsomedial portion of the nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis on the contralateral side</BrainRegion>. Less dense terminals were also seen in the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the brachium of the inferior colliculus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>cuneiform nucleus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>medial part of the paralemniscal tegmental field</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>dorsolateral division of the pontine nuclei on the ipsilateral side</BrainRegion>. Following the injection of muscimol into the <BrainRegion>pretectum</BrainRegion>, including the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the optic tract</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>posterior pretectal nucleus</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the posterior commissure</BrainRegion>, accommodative responses evoked by microstimulation of the <BrainRegion>superior colliculu</BrainRegion>s were reduced to 33-55% of the value before the injections. These findings suggest that the <BrainRegion>accommodation area in the superior colliculus</BrainRegion> projects to the <BrainRegion>oculomotor nucleus</BrainRegion> through the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral pretectal area</BrainRegion>, especially the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the optic tract</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>nucleus of posterior commissure</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>posterior pretectal nucleus</BrainRegion>, and also projects to the <BrainRegion>pupilloconstriction area</BrainRegion> (the <BrainRegion>olivary pretectal nucleus</BrainRegion>), the <BrainRegion>vergence-related area</BrainRegion> (the <BrainRegion>mesencephalic reticular formation</BrainRegion>), and the <BrainRegion>active visual fixation-related area</BrainRegion> (the nucleus raphe interpositus).</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Associational and commissural afferents of parvalbumin-immunoreactive neurons in the rat <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion>: a combined immunocytochemical and PHA-L study.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Nonpyramidal neurons containing the calcium-binding protein parvalbumin (PV) are one of the inhibitory elements of the <BrainRegion>hippocampal</BrainRegion> network. Previous studies have indicated that they are involved in septohippocampal disinhibitory circuits. This study analyzes the commissural and ipsilateral associational afferents of parvalbumin neurons. Injections of the anterograde tracer Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) into the <BrainRegion>hilus of the fascia dentata</BrainRegion> labeled numerous axons in the molecular layer that established synaptic contacts with parvalbumin-immunoreactive neurons on both the injection and the contralateral side. Mossy fibers, labeled by injections into the granule cell layer, terminated on parvalbumin neurons in the <BrainRegion>hilus</BrainRegion> and in <BrainRegion>CA3</BrainRegion>. Injections of Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin(PHA-L) into <BrainRegion>CA3</BrainRegion> resulted in a dense labeling of fibers in the <BrainRegion>hilus</BrainRegion> and in <BrainRegion>CA3</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>CA2</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>CA1</BrainRegion> on both the injection and the contralateral side. In all these <BrainRegion>hippocampal</BrainRegion> fields, Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin(PHA-L) -labeled fibers established asymmetric contacts with parvalbumin(PV) -immunoreactive, presumably GABAergic, inhibitory neurons. These observations indicate that parvalbumin-immunoreactive inhibitory neurons in the <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion> are targets of presumably excitatory associational and commissural projections and suggest that they are involved in feed-forward and feed-back circuits.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Single unit recordings in the <BrainRegion>auditory nerve</BrainRegion> of congenitally deaf white cats: morphological correlates in the <BrainRegion>cochlea</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>cochlear nucleus</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>It is well known that experimentally induced <BrainRegion>cochlear</BrainRegion> damage produces structural, physiological, and biochemical alterations in neurons of the <BrainRegion>cochlear nucleus</BrainRegion>. In contrast, much less is known with respect to the naturally occurring <BrainRegion>cochlear</BrainRegion> pathology presented by congenital deafness. The present study attempts to relate <BrainRegion>organ of Corti</BrainRegion> structure and <BrainRegion>auditory nerve</BrainRegion> activity to the morphology of primary synaptic endings in the <BrainRegion>cochlear nucleus</BrainRegion> of congenitally deaf white cats. Our observations reveal that the amount of sound-evoked spike activity in <BrainRegion>auditory nerve</BrainRegion> fibers influences terminal morphology and synaptic structure in the <BrainRegion>anteroventral cochlear nucleus</BrainRegion>. Some white cats had no hearing. They exhibited severely reduced spontaneous activity and no sound-evoked activity in <BrainRegion>auditory nerve</BrainRegion> fibers. They had no recognizable <BrainRegion>organ of Corti</BrainRegion>, presented &amp;gt;90% loss of spiral ganglion cells, and displayed marked structural abnormalities of <BrainRegion>endbulbs of Held</BrainRegion> and their synapses. Other white cats had partial hearing and possessed <BrainRegion>auditory nerve</BrainRegion> fibers with a wide range of spontaneous activity but elevated sound-evoked thresholds (60-70 dB SPL). They also exhibited obvious abnormalities in the <BrainRegion>tectorial membrane</BrainRegion>, supporting cells, and Reissner&apos;s membrane throughout the <BrainRegion>cochlear duct</BrainRegion> and had complete inner and outer hair cell loss in the base. The spatial distribution of spiral ganglion cell loss correlated with the pattern of hair cell loss. Primary neurons of hearing-impaired cats displayed structural abnormalities of their endbulbs and synapses in the <BrainRegion>cochlear nucleus</BrainRegion> which were intermediate in form compared to normal and totally deaf cats. Changes in endbulb structure appear to correspond to relative levels of deafness. These data suggest that endbulb structure is significantly influenced by sound-evoked <BrainRegion>auditory nerve</BrainRegion> activity.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>The radial fibers in the <BrainRegion>globus pallidus</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>In our <BrainRegion>Golgi</BrainRegion> collection of adult monkey brains the <BrainRegion>striatal</BrainRegion> efferents, i.e., the radial fibers in the <BrainRegion>globus pallidus</BrainRegion> and the &quot;comb" bundle fibers in the <BrainRegion>internal capsule</BrainRegion> and in the <BrainRegion>cerebral peduncle</BrainRegion>, are well impregnated in the horizontally sectioned brain and in a sagittal sectioned brain. Since collaterals emerging from radial fibers are seen only in the horizontal series and not in the saggittal series, the interpretation is that they proceed anteriorly and posteriorly only, following the curvature of the <BrainRegion>pallidal segments</BrainRegion>, and do not run superiorly or inferiorly as they emerge. Although radial fibers emitting collaterals in the lateral segment and in the medial segment of the <BrainRegion>globus pallidus</BrainRegion> have been observed, it has not been possible to observe the same radial fiber emitting collaterals in both <BrainRegion>pallidal segments</BrainRegion> and the prospects of ever doing so are not good. The radial fibers converging in the <BrainRegion>globus pallidus</BrainRegion> pursue many radii and there is little coincidence between the plane of section and the planes in which they travel. At most only severed radial fiber segments 100-150 microns in length can be found in the horizontal sections needed to observe the collaterals. Moreover, sagittal sections trodorsally, as they pass through the <BrainRegion>internal medullary lamina</BrainRegion> to enter the <BrainRegion>medial segment of the globus pallidus</BrainRegion>. The radial fibers in the <BrainRegion>medial segment of the globus pallidus</BrainRegion> are continuous with the &quot;comb" bundle fibers and appear to be thinner than the radial fibers in the <BrainRegion>lateral segment of the globus pallidus</BrainRegion>. It is not proved; nonetheless, the view expressed here is that the radial fibers are thinner in the <BrainRegion>medial segment of the globus pallidus</BrainRegion> because they may be the same fibers that gave off collaterals in the <BrainRegion>lateral segment of the globus pallidus</BrainRegion>. This is discussed in the light of the electrophysiological disclosure of Yoshida et al. (&apos;71, '72) that caudatopallidal fibers are collaterals off caudatonigral fibers. The afferent plexuses of fine, "bouton en passage" fibers, which completely ensheath the long radiating dendrites in the <BrainRegion>globus pallidus</BrainRegion> (Fox et al., &apos;66) are well impregnated in the horizontal series. Obviously, they are formed by a number of ultimate branches converging from the collateral brances of a number of different radial fibers. The divergence, too, in this system must be considerable; however, its true extent can only be surmised from the several radial fibers and radial fiber collaterals seen in the incompletely impregnanted <BrainRegion>Golgi</BrainRegion> section.

<ArticleTitle>Early <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> enrichment and deprivation both decrease beta-adrenergic receptor density in the <BrainRegion>main olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> of the rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The density of noradrenergic <BrainRegion>locus coeruleus</BrainRegion> projections and beta-adrenergic receptors in the <BrainRegion>main olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> of the rat increases with age. Both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptor subtypes exhibit laminar distributions, with focal regions of high receptor density present within the neuropil of individual glomeruli. Since the first synaptic contacts between <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> receptor neurons and <BrainRegion>bulbar</BrainRegion> neurons occur within the glomeruli, early <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> experiences possibly could influence the density or distribution of beta-adrenergic receptors in the <BrainRegion>bulb</BrainRegion>. We therefore investigated the effects of <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> deprivation and early <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> enrichment on the density and distribution of beta-adrenergic receptors in the <BrainRegion>main olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>. Animals were subjected to either unilateral naris closure on postnatal day 1 or odor training from postnatal days 1-18. <BrainRegion>Bulbs</BrainRegion> were removed on postnatal day 19 and subjected to quantitative autoradiography using the beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist [125I]iodopindolol and specific receptor subtype antagonists ICI 118,551 (beta 2-antagonist) and ICI 89,406 (beta 1-antagonist). Unilateral naris occlusion decreased both the number of beta 2 glomerular foci and the density of beta 1 and beta 2 receptors in the deprived <BrainRegion>bulb</BrainRegion> compared to the nondeprived bulb. Early odor training resulted in a significant decrease in the number, area, and receptor density of beta 2 glomerular foci in the <BrainRegion>midlateral region of the bulb</BrainRegion>. The distribution of beta 2 glomerular foci also differs with these two sensory manipulations. Changes in beta-adrenergic receptor density in response to both early learning and <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> deprivation may be induced by a transient increase in <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> norepinephrine.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Ultrastructural evidence for direct projections from the <BrainRegion>pontine micturition center</BrainRegion> to glycine-immunoreactive neurons in the <BrainRegion>sacral dorsal gray commissure</BrainRegion> in the cat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>During micturition, according to the concept of Blok, Holstege, and colleagues ([1997] Neurosci. Lett. 233:109-112), the <BrainRegion>pontine micturition center</BrainRegion> (PMC) elicits bladder contraction by way of direct excitation of the parasympathetic bladder motoneurons. At the same time, the <BrainRegion>pontine micturition center</BrainRegion>(PMC) elicits relaxation of the external urethral sphincter (EUS) by excitation of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic interneurons in the <BrainRegion>sacral dorsal gray commissure</BrainRegion> (DGC), which, in turn, inhibit external urethral sphincter(EUS) motoneurons. The question is whether the inhibitory neurotransmitter glycine is also involved in this system. The present study investigated, first, whether there are glycine immunoreactive interneurons in the <BrainRegion>sacral dorsal gray commissure</BrainRegion>(DGC) and, second, whether they receive direct <BrainRegion>pontine micturition center</BrainRegion>(PMC) afferents. Finally, it was determined whether glycine and gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) are colocalized in <BrainRegion>dorsal gray commissure</BrainRegion>(DGC) interneurons. In two adult male cats, the <BrainRegion>pontine micturition center</BrainRegion>(PMC) was identified by electrical stimulation. Subsequently, the identified region was injected with the anterograde tracer WGA-HRP. Sections of <BrainRegion>sacral cord segments</BrainRegion> were processed for light and electron microscopic detection of anterograde labeling, as well as for glycine and gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) , using postembedding immunogold labeling with antibodies. In total 128 labeled <BrainRegion>pontine micturition center</BrainRegion>(PMC) terminals were found in the <BrainRegion>dorsal gray commissure</BrainRegion>(DGC) , which contained many round vesicles and asymmetric synapses. About 31.3% (40 of 128) made contact with glycine-immunoreactive dendrites. Eleven of them were selected for serial sectioning, which showed that 54.6% (6 of 11) of the glycine-immunoreactive dendrites were also immunoreactive for gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) . The results demonstrate that the <BrainRegion>pontine micturition center</BrainRegion>(PMC) projects directly to dendrites of interneurons in the <BrainRegion>sacral dorsal gray commissure</BrainRegion>(DGC) , which are immunoreactive for both glycine and gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) . These interneurons are thought to inhibit the external urethral sphincter(EUS) motoneurons during micturition.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Cholinergic innervation in adult rat <BrainRegion>cerebral cortex</BrainRegion>: a quantitative immunocytochemical description.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>A method for determining the length of acetylcholine (ACh) axons and number of acetylcholine(ACh) axon varicosities (terminals) in brain sections immunostained for choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) was used to estimate the areal and laminar densities of this innervation in the <BrainRegion>frontal (motor), parietal (somatosensory), and occipital (visual) cortex</BrainRegion> of adult rat. The number of acetylcholine(ACh) varicosities per length of axon (4 per 10 microm) appeared constant in the different layers and areas. The mean density of acetylcholine(ACh) axons was the highest in the <BrainRegion>frontal cortex</BrainRegion> (13.0 m/mm(3) vs. 9.9 and 11.0 m/mm(3) in the <BrainRegion>somatosensory and visual cortex</BrainRegion>, respectively), as was the mean density of acetylcholine(ACh) varicosities (5.4 x 10(6)/mm(3) vs. 3.8 and 4.6 x 10(6)/mm(3)). In all three areas, layer I displayed the highest laminar densities of acetylcholine(ACh) axons and varicosities (e.g., 13.5 m/mm(3) and 5.4 x 10(6)/mm(3) in <BrainRegion>frontal cortex</BrainRegion>). The lowest were those of layer IV in the <BrainRegion>parietal cortex</BrainRegion> (7.3 m/mm(3) and 2.9 x 10(6)/mm(3)). The lengths of acetylcholine(ACh) axons under a 1 mm(2) surface of <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion> were 26.7, 19.7, and 15.3 m in the <BrainRegion>frontal, parietal, and occipital areas</BrainRegion>, respectively, for corresponding numbers of 11.1, 7.7, and 6.4 x 10(6) acetylcholine(ACh) varicosities. In the <BrainRegion>parietal cortex</BrainRegion>, this meant a total of 1.2 x 10(6) synaptic acetylcholine(ACh) varicosities under a 1 mm(2) surface, 48% of which in layer V alone, according to previous electron microscopic estimates of synaptic incidence. In keeping with the notion that the synaptic component of acetylcholine(ACh) transmission in <BrainRegion>cerebral cortex</BrainRegion> is preponderant in layer V, these quantitative data suggest a role for this innervation in the processing of <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> output as well as input. Extrapolation of particular features of this system in terms of total axon length and number of varicosities in whole <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion>, length of axons and number of varicosities per cortically projecting neuron, and concentration of acetylcholine(ACh) per axon varicosity, should also help in arriving at a better definition of its roles and functional properties in <BrainRegion>cerebral cortex</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Immunocytochemical mapping and quantification of expression of a putative type 1 serotonin receptor in the crayfish nervous system.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Serotonin is an important neurotransmitter that is involved in modulation of sensory, motor, and higher functions in many species. In the crayfish, which has been developed as a model for nervous system function for over a century, serotonin modulates several identified circuits. Although the cellular and circuit effects of serotonin have been extensively studied, little is known about the receptors that mediate these signals. Physiological data indicate that identified crustacean cells and circuits are modulated via several different serotonin receptors. We describe the detailed immunocytochemical localization of the crustacean type 1 serotonin receptor, 5-HT1crust, throughout the crayfish nerve cord and on abdominal superficial flexor muscles. 5-HT1crust is widely distributed in somata, including those of several identified neurons, and neuropil, suggesting both synaptic and neurohormonal roles. Individual animals show very different levels of 5-HT1crust immunoreactivity (5-HT(1crust)ir) ranging from preparations with hundreds of labeled cells per ganglion to some containing only a handful of 5-HT(1crust)ir cells in the entire nerve cord. The interanimal variability in 5-HT(1crust)ir is great, but individual nerve cords show a consistent level of labeling between ganglia. Quantitative RT-PCR shows that 5-HT1crust mRNA levels between animals are also variable but do not directly correlate with 5-HT(1crust)ir levels. Although there is no correlation of 5-HT1crust expression with gender, social status, molting or feeding, dominant animals show significantly greater variability than subordinates. Functional analysis of 5-HT1crust in combination with this immunocytochemical map will aid further understanding of this receptor&apos;s role in the actions of serotonin on identified circuits and cells.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Distribution and morphology of nociceptive cells in the CNS of three species of leeches.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The present study describes the segmental variation in the distribution and morphology of nociceptive neurons (N cells) in the central nervous system of the leech. N cells of midbody ganglia can be segregated into lateral and medial types. We show that monoclonal antibodies specific for N cells can distinguish between the two populations. The monoclonal antibodies were used to map the complete distribution of the cells along the nervous cord. There are two pairs of the medial and lateral nociceptive neurons in the midbody ganglia, one pair of the medial type in the sex ganglia (5 and 6), and a pair of the lateral type in ganglia 20 and 21. The caudal brain is without nociceptive neurons. This distribution was confirmed by electrophysiological means. The morphology of N cells in different parts of the nervous system was investigated by intracellular horseradish peroxidase (HRP) injections. In the terminal segmental ganglia the N cells showed extensive arborizations in the head and tail brains and, contrary to N cells in the midbody ganglia, their arborizations spanned more than three segments. N cells are absent in the tail brain, but the N cells of ganglia 20 and 21 were shown to innervate the entire caudal region. The basic morphology of all N-cell homologues was found to be very similar for three leech species. In the sex ganglia the pair of N-cell homologues were examined in Haemopis, Hirudo, and Macrobdella. The results showed a progressive modification in the three species of the cell&apos;s morphology, peripheral projections, and physiological responses, possibly correlated with the evolution and complexity of the sexual organs. horseradish peroxidase(HRP) injections and monoclonal antibody staining revealed that a common feature of N-cell homologues is the presence of processes that tightly surround the cell soma of other cells. This suggests that N cells may have other functional properties in addition to being primary sensory neurons.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Connections of indoleamine-accumulating cells in the rabbit <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>To study the connections of the neurons of the rabbit <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> that accumulate indoleamines, we injected 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine into the vitreous body. It accumulated within a subset of amacrine cells and could be visualized there by aldehyde-induced fluorescence. The fluorescent labeling was photo-converted to an insoluble, osmiophilic product by irradiation in the presence of diaminobenzidine, and the tissue was examined by electron microscopy. Preservation of the structure of the tissue after photoconversion was satisfactory and the dendrites of the indoleamine-accumulating cells could easily be identified. They form a dense plexus near the junction of the inner plexiform and ganglion cell layers, where they exhibit large synaptic endings that occupy a substantial fraction of the surface of rod bipolar terminals. The dendrites of the indoleamine-accumulating cells receive input from rod bipolars at dyad synapses, where the other postsynaptic partner is a dendrite of a narrow-field, bistratified amacrine cell; in addition, they receive amacrine cell input throughout the inner plexiform layer. The only outputs we observed are reciprocal synapses onto the rod bipolar endings. Thus, these amacrine cells appear to exert an important effect on the transmission of scotopic information through the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Representation of the calyces in the <BrainRegion>medial and vertical lobes</BrainRegion> of cockroach mushroom bodies.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Previous studies of honey bee and cockroach mushroom bodies have proposed that afferent terminals and intrinsic neurons (Kenyon cells) in the calyces are arranged according to polar coordinates. It has been suggested that there is a transformation by Kenyon cell axons of the polar arrangements of their dendrites in the calyces to laminar arrangements of their terminals in the lobes. Findings presented here show that cellular organization in the calyx of an evolutionarily basal neopteran, Periplaneta americana, is instead rectilinear, as it is in the lobes. It is shown that each calyx is divided into two halves (hemicalyces), each supplied by its own set of Kenyon cells. Each calyx is separately represented in the <BrainRegion>medial lobe</BrainRegion> where the dendritic trees of some efferent neurons receive inputs from one calyx only. Kenyon cell dendrites are arranged as narrow elongated fields, organized as rows in each hemicalyx. Dendritic fields arise from 14 to 16 sheets of Kenyon cell axons stacked on top of each other lining the inner surface of the calyx cup. A sheet consists of approximately 60 small bundles, each containing 5-15 axons that converge from the rim of the calyx to its neck. Each sheet contributes to a pair oflaminae, one dark one pale, called a doublet, that extends through the mushroom body. Dark laminae contain Kenyon cell axons packed with synaptic vesicles. Axons in pale laminae are sparsely equipped with vesicles. By analogy with photoreceptors, and with reference to field potential recordings, it is speculated that dark laminae are continuously active, being modulated by odor stimuli, whereas pale laminae are intermittently activated. Timm&apos;s silver staining and immunocytology reveal a second type of longitudinal division of the lobes. Five layers extend through the pedunculus and lobes, each composed of subsets of doublets. Four layers represent zones of afferent endings in the calyces. A fifth (the y layer) represents a specific type of Kenyon cell. It is concluded that the mushroom bodies comprise two independent modular systems, doublets and layers. Developmental studies show that new doublets are added at each instar to layers that are already present early in second instar nymphs. There are profound similarities between the mushroom bodies of Periplaneta, an evolutionarily basal taxon, and those of Drosophila melanogaster and the honey bee.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>The dorsolateral corticospinal tract in mice: an alternative route for corticospinal input to caudal segments following <BrainRegion>dorsal column</BrainRegion> lesions.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>In rodents, the main contingent of corticospinal tract (CST) axons descends in the <BrainRegion>ventral part of the dorsal column</BrainRegion>. There is, however, a contingent of corticospinal tract(CST) axons that descends in the <BrainRegion>dorsolateral column</BrainRegion> (the &quot;dorsolateral corticospinal tract," or DL corticospinal tract(CST) ). Here, we define some of the features of the DL corticospinal tract(CST) by tracing corticospinal tract(CST) projections following injections of biotinylated dextran amine into the <BrainRegion>sensorimotor cortex</BrainRegion>, assessing the distribution of DL corticospinal tract(CST) axons and terminal arborizations in intact mice and in mice in which the main contingent of corticospinal tract(CST) axons in the <BrainRegion>dorsal column</BrainRegion> had been transected. Axons of the DL corticospinal tract(CST) diverge from the main tract at the pyramidal decussation, gather in fascicles in the <BrainRegion>dorsolateral gray matter</BrainRegion> below the <BrainRegion>spinomedullary junction</BrainRegion>, and project in a gradual trajectory laterally toward the <BrainRegion>dorsolateral column</BrainRegion> over the first few cervical segments. DL corticospinal tract(CST) axons then project along the <BrainRegion>dorsolateral column</BrainRegion> to sacral levels, giving rise to collaterals that project into the gray matter. Labeled DL corticospinal tract(CST) axons were most abundant in cervical segments, where they were often collected in fascicles, and progressively decreased in number in more caudal segments. Tracing of DL corticospinal tract(CST) axons in mice with selective lesions of the <BrainRegion>dorsal column</BrainRegion> revealed that DL corticospinal tract(CST) axons arborize extensively throughout the <BrainRegion>dorsal and ventral horns</BrainRegion> and that the overall territory that the DL corticospinal tract(CST) axons invade is similar to the territory innervated by the corticospinal tract(CST) axons in the main tract. Some DL corticospinal tract(CST) axon arbors with varicosities are seen near large neurons in the <BrainRegion>ventral horn</BrainRegion> (presumed motoneurons). Substantial numbers of DL corticospinal tract(CST) axons project across the midline to the gray matter on the contralateral side. Thus, the DL corticospinal tract(CST) provides an alternate route for corticospinal tract(CST) input to caudal segments, which is of particular relevance for studies of corticospinal tract(CST) distribution and function following partial <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> injuries.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>N-acetylaspartylglutamate immunoreactivity in neurons of the monkey&apos;s visual pathway.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The acidic dipeptide N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG) was identified immunohistochemically within neurons of the visual pathways of two adult macaque monkeys which had undergone midsagittal sectioning of the <BrainRegion>optic chiasm</BrainRegion> 6 or 9 years earlier. In both <BrainRegion>temporal and nasal retinae</BrainRegion>, amacrine cells, including some displaced amacrine cells, expressed N-acetylaspartylglutamate(NAAG) immunoreactivity. In temporal but not nasal <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> ganglion cells were stained, as were their dendrites in the inner plexiform layer, and their axons in the <BrainRegion>optic nerve</BrainRegion> fiber layer. In <BrainRegion>nasal retina</BrainRegion>, the ganglion cells had degenerated because they were axotomized by the <BrainRegion>optic chiasm</BrainRegion> section. In the target regions of the <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> ganglion cells, the <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion> (LGN), both neuropil and cell bodies were stained. In <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(LGN) , staining was confined to layers 2, 3, and 5, that is, to the layers innervated by the intact ipsilateral pathway. Immunoreactivity was also seen in the cells of layers 2, 3A, 4B, 5, and 6 of <BrainRegion>area 17</BrainRegion> and layers 3 and 5 of <BrainRegion>area 18</BrainRegion>. The neuropil was stained in all layers of <BrainRegion>area 17</BrainRegion>, but more heavily in layers 1, 2, 4B, the bottom of 4C beta, 5B, and 6B. Within 4C the staining was patchy; in tangential sections there were alternating bands of light and dark label which matched the ocular dominance bands demonstrated by cytochrome oxidase histochemistry in adjacent sections. This banding pattern is consistent with the presence of N-acetylaspartylglutamate(NAAG) in geniculocortical terminals of the intact ipsilateral pathway and the absence of such terminals for the contralateral pathway, which had undergone transneuronal degeneration due to the <BrainRegion>optic chiasm</BrainRegion> sectioning. Overall, our results for monkey are very similar to those in cat and suggest that N-acetylaspartylglutamate(NAAG) or a structurally related molecule may have a prominent role in the communication of visual signals at <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> levels.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Increased <BrainRegion>cerebellar</BrainRegion> Purkinje cell numbers in mice overexpressing a human bcl-2 transgene.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The Purkinje cell is a primary organizer in the development of the <BrainRegion>cerebellum</BrainRegion>. Purkinje cells may provide positional information cues that regulate afferent innervation, and Purkinje cell target size controls the adult number of afferent olivary neurons and granule cells. While Purkinje cells are necessary for the survival of <BrainRegion>olivary</BrainRegion> neurons and granule cells during periods of programmed cell death, little is known about the survival requirements of Purkinje cells in vivo. To determine if Purkinje cells are subject to programmed cell death during development we have analyzed Purkinje cell numbers in two lines of transgenic mice that overexpress a human gene for bcl-2 (Hu-bcl-2). Bcl-2 is a protooncogene that inhibits apoptosis in many cell types. Overexpression of bcl-2 in vitro and in vivo rescues neurons from trophic factor deprivation or naturally occurring cell death. In the mice analyzed in this study, transgene expression is driven by the neuron-specific enolase promoter that is first expressed embryonically in most regions of the brain in one line and postnatally in the second line. We have counted Purkinje cells in three adult control mice, five early overexpressing transgenics, and three late expressing transgenics. The number of Purkinje cells in the human gene for bcl-2(Hu-bcl-2) transgenic mice is significantly increased above control numbers, with an increase of 43% in the embryonically overexpressing line and an increase of 27% in the postnatally overexpressing line. Because bcl-2 overexpression has been shown to rescue other neurons from programmed cell death, the increase in Purkinje cell numbers in overexpressing bcl-2 transgenics suggests that Purkinje cells undergo a period of cell death during normal development.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Time frame of mitral cell development in the mice <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Along with tufted cells, mitral cells are the principal projection neurons in the <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> (OB). During the development of the <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb(</BrainRegion>OB) , mitral cells migrate from the <BrainRegion>ventricular zone</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>intermediate zone</BrainRegion>, where they begin to send axons along the lateral olfactory tract (LOT) to the <BrainRegion>cortical olfactory zones</BrainRegion>. Subsequently, they lose their tangential orientation, enabling them to make contact with the axons of the <BrainRegion>olfactory sensory neurons</BrainRegion> (OSN) that innervate the whole <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>(OB) . Here, we investigated the distinct morphological features displayed by developing mitral cells and analyzed the relationship between the changes undertaken by these neurons and the arrival of the <BrainRegion>olfactory sensory neurons(</BrainRegion>OSN) axons. Immunostaining for specific markers of developing axons and dendrites, coupled with the use of fluorescent tracers, revealed the morphological changes, the continuous reorientation, and the final refinement that these cells undergo. We found that some of these changes are dependent on the arrival of the <BrainRegion>olfactory sensory neurons</BrainRegion>(OSN) axons. Indeed, we identified three main chronological events: 1) newly generated neurons become established in the <BrainRegion>intermediate zone</BrainRegion> and project to the lateral olfactory tract(LOT) ; 2) the cells reorient and spread their dendrites at the same time as <BrainRegion>olfactory sensory neurons</BrainRegion>(OSN) axons penetrate the <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>(OB) (this is a sensitive period between embryonic day (E)15-16, in which the arrival of afferents establishes a spatial and temporal gradient that facilitates protoglomerulus and glomerulus formation); and 3) final refinement of the radially orientated cells to adopt a mature morphology. These results suggest that both afferent inputs and intrinsic factors participate to produce the well-defined sensory system.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Distribution of tyrosine-hydroxylase-immunoreactive neurons in the <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion> of rats.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The distribution and morphology of cells containing tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunoreactivity in the <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion> of rats were studied by using a modified immunoperoxidase technique. The tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) cell system is more complexly organized than was previously thought. On the basis of their clustering patterns, <BrainRegion>hypothalamic</BrainRegion> tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) neurons could be subdivided into two groups: dorsal and ventral. The ventral group consists of a prominent aggregate of cells located in the <BrainRegion>caudal part of the arcuate nucleus</BrainRegion>. From here, cells extend around the <BrainRegion>caudal part of the ventromedial and dorsomedial nuclei</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>base of the diencephalon</BrainRegion>. Tyrosine hydroxylase-positive cells are present throughout the <BrainRegion>arcuate nucleus</BrainRegion>, except in its ventromedial part. Anteriorly, immunoreactive cells appear in the <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic and supraoptic nuclei</BrainRegion>, in the <BrainRegion>retrochiasmatic area</BrainRegion>, and in the ventral part of the <BrainRegion>anterior hypothalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>. The dorsal group has its main concentration of cells in the <BrainRegion>medial part of the zona incerta</BrainRegion>, from which two clusters of cells, one medial and one lateral, extend rostralward. The medial group comprises cells in the medial part of the <BrainRegion>dorsomedial, paraventricular, and anterior hypothalamic nuclei</BrainRegion>. These cells adjoin the periventricular cells. The lateral group of cells emanating from the <BrainRegion>zona incerta</BrainRegion> occupies the <BrainRegion>lateral part of the dorsomedial and anterior hypothalamic nuclei</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>dorsal hypothalamic area</BrainRegion>. The dorsal and ventral tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) cell groups are in continuity medially in the periventricular layer, and laterally through the cells that surround the <BrainRegion>ventromedial nucleus</BrainRegion>. Although the cells vary widely in size, shape, and dendritic arborization pattern, there are two main cell types. Small (21 X 11 microns), round to fusiform cells, with two or three dendrites arborizing simply, were frequently seen in the <BrainRegion>arcuate</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic, periventricular, supramammillary nuclei</BrainRegion> and at the borders of the <BrainRegion>ventromedial nucleus</BrainRegion>. The other cell type is larger (40 X 15 microns) and multipolar, with three to five frequently branching dendrites. The dendritic field is large and the cells are intensely tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) -immunoreactive. Although the larger cells occur occasionally in every <BrainRegion>hypothalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>, their principal locations are in the <BrainRegion>dorsal parts of the dorsomedial, posterior hypothalamic nuclei</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>dorsal and lateral parts of the zona incerta</BrainRegion>, and in the areas <BrainRegion>dorsal and medial to the mammillothalamic tract</BrainRegion> at caudal <BrainRegion>hypothalamic</BrainRegion> levels. In this paper we give a detailed description of tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) -immunoreactive fibers and terminals in the <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion> and a comparison with previous studies of catecholamine cells in the <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>The projections from <BrainRegion>striate cortex</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>V1</BrainRegion>) to <BrainRegion>areas V2</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>V3</BrainRegion> in the macaque monkey: asymmetries, areal boundaries, and patchy connections.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The organization of projections from <BrainRegion>V1</BrainRegion> to <BrainRegion>areas V2</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>V3</BrainRegion> in the macaque monkey was studied with a combination of anatomical techniques, including lesions and tracer injections made in different portions of <BrainRegion>V1</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>V2</BrainRegion> in 20 experimental hemispheres. Our results indicate that <BrainRegion>dorsal V1</BrainRegion> (representing the <BrainRegion>inferior contralateral visual quadrant</BrainRegion>) consistently projects in topographically organized fashion to <BrainRegion>V3</BrainRegion> in the <BrainRegion>lunate and parietooccipital sulci</BrainRegion> as well as to the <BrainRegion>middle temporal area</BrainRegion> (MT) and <BrainRegion>dorsal V2</BrainRegion>. In contrast, <BrainRegion>ventral V1</BrainRegion> (representing the <BrainRegion>superior contralateral quadrant</BrainRegion>) projects only to <BrainRegion>middle temporal area</BrainRegion>(MT) and <BrainRegion>ventral V2</BrainRegion>. A corresponding dorsoventral asymmetry in myeloarchitecture supports the idea that <BrainRegion>V3</BrainRegion> is an area that is restricted to <BrainRegion>dorsal extrastriate cortex</BrainRegion> and lacks a complete representation of the visual field. The average surface area of myeloarchitectonically identified V3 was 89 mm2. Additional information was obtained concerning the laminar distribution of connections from <BrainRegion>V1</BrainRegion> to <BrainRegion>V2</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>V3</BrainRegion>, the patchiness of these projections, and the consistency of projections to other extrastriate areas, including <BrainRegion>V4</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>V3A</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Identification of central nervous system neurons that innervate the bladder body, bladder base, or external urethral sphincter of female rats: a transneuronal tracing study using pseudorabies virus.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Transneuronal tracing techniques were used to identify the putative <BrainRegion>spinal</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion> neurons involved in continence and voiding in the female rat. Pseudorabies virus, Bartha&apos;s K strain, was injected into either the external urethral sphincter, the bladder base, or the bladder body. After 3-5 days, the rats were perfused with fixative, and virus-labelled cells were identified by using immunohistochemistry. External urethral sphincter (EUS) injections resulted in labelling of pudendal motoneurons in the dorsolateral nucleus of L6. Putative <BrainRegion>spinal</BrainRegion> interneurons were found in the <BrainRegion>medial cord</BrainRegion> from T13 to S1 and in the <BrainRegion>lateral gray</BrainRegion> of T13-L2 and L5-S1. After both bladder base and bladder body injections, the majority of pseudorabies virus-labelled cells were found in the <BrainRegion>lateral gray</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>medial cord</BrainRegion> of L6-S1. A number of those found in the <BrainRegion>intermediolateral cell column</BrainRegion> resembled the parasympathetic preganglionic neurons; the remaining neurons in the <BrainRegion>lateral and medial gray</BrainRegion> were presumed to be interneurons. Very few pseudorabies virus-labelled cells were found rostral to T10. In the <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion>, transneuronally labelled cells were found in the <BrainRegion>parapyramidal medullary reticular formation</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>Barrington&apos;s nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>raphe magnus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>raphe pallidus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>subcoeruleus pars alpha</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>locus coeruleus</BrainRegion>, the A5 noradrenergic cell group, and <BrainRegion>ventromedial periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion> after all injection sites. Pseudorabies virus-labelled cells were also seen in the <BrainRegion>forebrain</BrainRegion> following the longest survival times; areas consistently labelled included the <BrainRegion>lateral hypothalamus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>parvocellular region of the paraventricular nucleus</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>medial preoptic area</BrainRegion>. These studies indicate that there is a substantial overlap of central nervous system neurons that innervate the External urethral sphincter(EUS) and the bladder in the female.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Co-occurrence of calcium-binding proteins and calcium-permeable glutamate receptors in the <BrainRegion>primary gustatory nucleus</BrainRegion> of goldfish.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText><BrainRegion>Primary vagal gustatory</BrainRegion> afferents utilize glutamate as a neurotransmitter acting on AMPA/kainate receptors of second-order neurons. Some forms of ionotropic glutamate receptors permit passage of Ca++ ions upon activation by appropriate ligands. Calcium-binding proteins (CaBPs) play a buffering role for regulating the concentration of intracellular calcium. In the present study, we used immunohistochemistry to examine the distribution and morphology of neurons with Calcium-binding proteins(CaBPs) , including calretinin, calbindin, and parvalbumin, and to compare this distribution with neurons exhibiting Ca++-permeable glutamate receptors as determined by kainate-stimulated uptake of Co++ in the <BrainRegion>vagal lobe</BrainRegion> of goldfish. Calretinin- and calbindin-positive neurons occurred throughout the sensory zone including round unipolar, horizontal; and perpendicular bipolar or multipolar somata. Parvalbumin neurons were mainly round monopolar neurons, especially common in the superficial layers of the sensory zone. In the motor zone, while parvalbumin labeled nearly all motoneurons, calretinin labeled only external motoneurons. In double labeling with calretinin and parvalbumin, few neurons in the sensory layer labeled with both antisera. Immunocytochemistry following kainate-stimulate uptake of Co++ showed that most calretinin, but few parvalbumin immunopositive neurons also were labeled by cobalt in the central and deep layers of the sensory zone. All motoneurons were labeled by Co++, including those immunoreactive for calretinin or parvalbumin. These results indicate that calretinin expression is strongly correlated with calcium-permeable ionotropic glutamate receptors in the neurons of the sensory zone of the goldfish <BrainRegion>vagal lobe</BrainRegion>, but even within this limited region, not all Ca++-permeable neurons possess any of the Calcium-binding proteins(CaBPs) examined.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Afferent innervation of outer hair cells in adult cats: I. Light microscopic analysis of fibers labeled with horseradish peroxidase.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Outer spiral fibers (OSFs), the afferent innervation of the outer hair cells (OHCs), were retrogradely labeled following horseradish peroxidase injections into the cat&apos;s <BrainRegion>auditory nerve</BrainRegion>. The peripheral branching patterns of 85 Outer spiral fibers(OSFs) from adult <BrainRegion>cochleas</BrainRegion> were reconstructed. Fibers contacted outer hair cells(OHCs) via terminal or en passant swellings; however, the latter were seen exclusively in the <BrainRegion>apical half of the cochlea</BrainRegion>. Many Outer spiral fibers(OSFs) also gave off branches ending on structures other than outer hair cells(OHCs) . Fibers in the <BrainRegion>cochlear apex</BrainRegion> were much more highly branched than in the base. Most fibers contacted only one row of outer hair cells(OHCs) , and more fibers contacted row 1 than row 2 or row 3 outer hair cells(OHCs) . Third-row fibers were the most highly branched in all <BrainRegion>cochlear regions</BrainRegion>. These results are consistent with a growing body of morphological evidence that suggests that the peripheral branching patterns of Outer spiral fibers(OSFs) may be fundamentally similar in all mammalian ears.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>A technique for estimating total spine numbers on Golgi-impregnated dendrites.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The functional significance of dendritic spines and their morphological sensitivity to a wide spectrum of experimental manipulations and pathological states have led to a number of studies in which counts of dendritic spine number have been carried out. These studies have, for the most part, involved the enumeration of only those spines which protrude from the opaque shafts of Golgi-impregnated dendrites into the clear zones flanking the dendrite. Such counts, limited to only those spines which are visible, underrepresent the true total number of spines borne by the dendrites. The magnitude of underrepresentation correlates positively with dendritic shaft diameter and negatively with spine length. This seriously restricts the usefulness of comparisons of spine density between dendrites, or even between segments of the same dendrite. In the present report, a geometrically based method is presented whereby total dendritic spine numbers can be estimated with reasonable accuracy, taking into account factors such as dendrite diameter and spine length. The technique entails the following principal steps: a determination, for a given length of dendrite over which spines are to be enumerated, of the volume of the flanking zones in which spines are visible and can be counted; a determination of the volume of the entire zone which encircles the dendritic shaft and which contains all spines, both visible and not visible; and a proportional extrapolation from the number of visible spines to obtain an estimate of the true total spine number. Tests of the predictive accuracy of the technique using dendrites of known total spine number suggest that estimates which deviate from true total spine numbers by less than 10% can be achieved.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Spinal</BrainRegion> projections from the <BrainRegion>medullary reticular formation</BrainRegion> of the North American opossum: heterogeneity.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Retrograde and orthograde transport techniques show that the <BrainRegion>nucleus reticularis gigantocellularis pars ventralis</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>nucleus reticularis gigantocellularis</BrainRegion> project the entire length of the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>. Double-labelling methods show that some of the neurons in each area innervate both cervical and lumbar levels. There is evidence, however, that neurons in the <BrainRegion>lateral part of the nucleus reticularis gigantocellularis pars ventralis</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>dorsal extreme of the nucleus reticularis gigantocellularis</BrainRegion> project mainly to <BrainRegion>cervical and thoracic levels</BrainRegion>. The autoradiographic method shows that the above nuclei supply direct innervation to <BrainRegion>somatic and autonomic motor columns</BrainRegion> as well as to laminae V-VIII and X. The <BrainRegion>nucleus reticularis gigantocellularis pars ventralis</BrainRegion> provides additional projections to lamina I and the outer part of lamina II. Several areas of the <BrainRegion>medullary reticular formation</BrainRegion> project mainly, and in some cases exclusively, to <BrainRegion>cervical and thoracic levels</BrainRegion>. These areas include the <BrainRegion>nucleus reticularis parvocellularis</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>nucleus reticularis lateralis</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>nucleus retrofacialis</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>nucleus ambiguus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>nucleus lateralis reticularis</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>caudal parts of the nuclei reticularis medullae oblongatae dorsalis and ventralis</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>nucleus supraspinalis</BrainRegion>. Autoradiographic experiments reveal that neurons in the <BrainRegion>ventrolateral medulla</BrainRegion>, particularly rostrally (the <BrainRegion>nucleus reticularis lateralis</BrainRegion> and neurons related to the <BrainRegion>nucleus lateralis reticularis</BrainRegion>), innervate sympathetic nuclei. Our results indicate that <BrainRegion>spinal</BrainRegion> projections from <BrainRegion>bulbar areas of the reticular formation</BrainRegion> are more complicated than previously supposed. Axons from separate areas project to different <BrainRegion>spinal levels</BrainRegion> and in some cases to different nuclear targets. These data are in conformity with the evolving concept of reticular heterogeneity.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Electrophysiological and morphological properties of light and dark cells isolated from mudpuppy taste buds.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Isolated Necturus taste receptor cells were studied by giga-seal whole-cell recording and electron microscopy to correlate electrophysiological properties with taste cell structural features. Dark (type I) cells were identified by the presence of dense granular packets in the supranuclear and apical regions of the cytoplasm. In response to a series of depolarizing voltage commands from a holding potential of -80 mV, these cells exhibited a transient, TTX-sensitive inward Na+ current, a sustained outward K+ current, and a slowly inactivating inward Ca++ current. Light (type II) cells were identified by a lack of granular packets and by an abundance of smooth endoplasmic reticulum distributed throughout the cell. In addition, isolated light cells had clear vesicular inclusions in the cytoplasm and blebs on the plasma membrane. Light cells were divided into two functional populations based upon electrophysiological criteria: cells with inward and outward currents, and cells with outward currents only. Light cells with inward and outward currents had voltage-activated Na+, K+, and Ca++ currents with properties similar to those of dark cells. In contrast, the second group of light cells had only voltage-activated outward K+ currents in response to depolarizing voltage commands. These data suggest that dark cells and light cells with inward and outward currents are capable of generating action potentials and releasing neurotransmitters onto gustatory afferent neurons in response to taste stimulation. In contrast, light cells with outward currents only likely serve a different function in the taste bud.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<AbstractText>Studies using axonal transport techniques on the North American opossum show that <BrainRegion>rubral neurons</BrainRegion> innervating the <BrainRegion>cervical cord</BrainRegion> are not distinctly separated from those which project to <BrainRegion>lumbar levels</BrainRegion>. The absence of clear rubrospinal somatotopy contrasts with that described for the placental mammals studied to date. Use of fluorescent markers in double-labeling experiments shows that most <BrainRegion>rubral neurons</BrainRegion> in the opossum still innervate either the cervical or lumbar enlargement alone, but that some supply collaterals to both levels.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<AbstractText>The distribution and number of dying cells in the developing <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> ganglion cell layer of the wallaby Setonix brachyurus were assessed by using cresyl violet stained tissue. The density of dying cells has been expressed per 100 live cells for the entire <BrainRegion>retinal surface</BrainRegion>, data being presented as a grid of 500 micron squares. For statistical analysis, <BrainRegion>retinae</BrainRegion> were divided into 8 regions; dorsal, ventral, nasal, and temporal quadrants, each further divided into center and periphery. This method allowed comparison of the extent of cell death at different <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> locations as the high density <BrainRegion>area centralis</BrainRegion> of live cells developed temporal to the <BrainRegion>optic disk</BrainRegion> from 60 days onward. Between 30 and 70 days, dying cells were seen across the entire <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>; beyond 100 days very few were seen. Initially, there was a significantly higher incidence of dying cells in the <BrainRegion>central retina</BrainRegion> compared to the periphery, whereas from 50 days this situation was reversed. Analysis of the <BrainRegion>central retina</BrainRegion> before and during <BrainRegion>area centralis</BrainRegion> formation consistently indicated a significantly lower number of dying cells per 100 live cells in temporal compared to other <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> quadrants. This differential pattern suggests that cell death lowers live cell densities less in the emerging <BrainRegion>area centralis</BrainRegion> than elsewhere, and therefore must play a part in establishing live cell density gradients. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that other factors are also instrumental. Indeed, factors such as areal growth (Beazley et al., in press) presumably operate at later stages since live cell density gradients continue to be accentuated even after cell death is complete. Numbers of dying cells peaked by 50 days, reaching approximately 1% of the live cell population. At this stage, counts were also maximal for live cells with values up to 30% above the adult range.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Morphological features of lamina V neurons receiving nociceptive input in cat <BrainRegion>sacrocaudal spinal cord</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Thirty-six neurons from laminae III-VII in cat <BrainRegion>sacrocaudal spinal cord</BrainRegion> were labeled by intracellular injection of horseradish peroxidase, following physiological characterization. Of these 36 neurons, 24 had cell bodies within lamina V. Twelve lamina V neurons were multireceptive; i.e., they responded differentially to innocuous and noxious mechanical stimuli. Most multireceptive neurons had the following morphological features: (1) large cell bodies; (2) extensive dendritic spreads in all directions; and (3) axons which ascended in the contralateral ventral white matter. Three labeled lamina V neurons were activated only by noxious stimuli. Compared to the multireceptive neurons, these nociceptive-specific (NS) units had smaller cell bodies but a similar dendritic spread. Seven lamina V neurons were excited by innocuous mechanical stimuli with no evidence of nociceptive input. These seven neurons had less extensive dendritic trees than the multireceptive and the nociceptive-specific(NS) neurons. Six neurons labeled in lamina VII (three multireceptive and three nociceptive-specific(NS) ) contrasted to most lamina V cells by having smaller cell bodies and short, sparsely branched dendrites. Among the lamina VII neurons, there was no obvious morphological feature that distinguished the multireceptive group from the nociceptive-specific(NS) group. Fifteen fully stained neurons from laminae III-VII had late discharges which were correlated with C fiber input. The dendrites of three of these neurons extended into laminae II and I; the dendrites of two neurons reached into the inner portion of lamina II; and the dorsal dendrites of the remaining ten neurons extended no further than the <BrainRegion>nucleus proprius</BrainRegion> (laminae III and IV). Thus, deeper <BrainRegion>dorsal horn</BrainRegion> neurons evincing reliable, excitatory influences from C fibers do not necessarily have superficially situated dendrites. Tests for correlations between size of cutaneous, excitatory receptive field (RF) and dendritic spread revealed a significant positive correlation between the mediolateral extent of dendritic spread and the size of the low-threshold component of the receptive field(RF) for lamina V neurons.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Differential expression of three different prepro-GnRH (gonadotrophin-releasing hormone) messengers in the brain of the european sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax).</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The expression sites of three prepro-gonadotrophin-releasing hormones (GnRHs), corresponding to seabream GnRH (sbGnRH: Ser(8)-mGnRH, mammalian GnRH), salmon GnRH (sGnRH: Trp(7)Leu(8)-mGnRH), and chicken GnRH-II (cGnRH-II: His(5)Trp(7)Tyr(8)-mGnRH) forms were studied in the brain of a perciform fish, the European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) by means of in situ hybridization. The riboprobes used in this study correspond to the three GnRH-associated peptide (GAP)-coding regions of the prepro-GnRH cDNAs cloned from the same species (salmon GnRH-associated peptide(GAP) : s GnRH-associated peptide(GAP) ; seabream GnRH-associated peptide(GAP) : sb GnRH-associated peptide(GAP) ; chicken GnRH-associated peptide(GAP) -II: cII GnRH-associated peptide(GAP) ), which show little oligonucleotide sequence identity (s GnRH-associated peptide(GAP) versus sb GnRH-associated peptide(GAP) : 42%; cII GnRH-associated peptide(GAP) versus sb GnRH-associated peptide(GAP) : 36%; s GnRH-associated peptide(GAP) versus cII GnRH-associated peptide(GAP) : 41%). Adjacent paraffin sections (6 mm) throughout the entire brain were treated in parallel with each of the three anti-sense probes and the corresponding sense probes, demonstrating the high specificity of the hybridization signal. The results showed that both s GnRH-associated peptide(GAP) and sb GnRH-associated peptide(GAP) mRNAs had a broader expression in the <BrainRegion>olfactory bulbs</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>ventral telencephalon</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>preoptic region</BrainRegion>, whereas cII GnRH-associated peptide(GAP) mRNA expression was confined to large cells of the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the medial longitudinal fascicle</BrainRegion>. In the <BrainRegion>olfactory bulbs</BrainRegion>, both the signal intensity and the number of positive cells were higher with the s GnRH-associated peptide(GAP) probe, whereas sb GnRH-associated peptide(GAP) mRNA-expressing cells were more numerous and intensely stained in the <BrainRegion>preoptic region</BrainRegion>. Additional isolated sb GnRH-associated peptide(GAP) -positive cells were detected in the <BrainRegion>ventrolateral hypothalamus</BrainRegion>. These results demonstrate a clear overlapping of s GnRH-associated peptide(GAP) - and sb GnRH-associated peptide(GAP) -expressing cells in the <BrainRegion>forebrain</BrainRegion> of the European sea bass, in contrast to previous reports in other perciforms showing a clear segregation of these two cell populations.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Location of muscarinic type 2 receptors within the synaptic circuitry of the cat <BrainRegion>visual thalamus</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>A cholinergic projection from the <BrainRegion>parabrachial region</BrainRegion> (PBR) of the <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>visual thalamus</BrainRegion> has been studied in great detail during the past 20 years. A number of physiological studies have demonstrated that this projection causes a dramatic change in <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> activity during the transition from sleep to wakefulness. Additionally, the <BrainRegion>parabrachial region</BrainRegion>(PBR) may mediate more subtle changes in <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> activity as attentional levels fluctuate during the waking state. The synaptic circuitry underlying these events has been identified in the cat <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion>. However, there is currently no anatomical information regarding the distribution of cholinergic receptors in relation to this circuitry. To begin to understand how the <BrainRegion>parabrachial region</BrainRegion>(PBR) projection modulates <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> activity, we used immunocytochemical techniques to examine the distribution of muscarinic type 2 (M2) receptors in the <BrainRegion>visual thalamus</BrainRegion> of the cat. The distribution of muscarinic type 2(M2) receptors correlates well with previous reports of the distribution of cholinergic terminals in the <BrainRegion>visual thalamus</BrainRegion>. At the light microscopic level, dense muscarinic type 2(M2) staining was seen in the neuropil of the <BrainRegion>dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion> (dLGN) and <BrainRegion>pulvinar nucleus</BrainRegion> and in somata and proximal dendrites of cells in the <BrainRegion>thalamic reticular nucleus</BrainRegion> (TRN). In the <BrainRegion>dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(dLGN) and <BrainRegion>pulvinar nucleus</BrainRegion>, we quantitatively analyzed the distribution of muscarinic type 2(M2) receptors using electron microscopy. Postembedding immunocytochemistry for gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) was used to determine whether muscarinic type 2(M2) receptors are present on interneurons or thalamocortical cells. In particular, we examined the distribution of muscarinic type 2(M2) receptors with respect to the known sites of <BrainRegion>parabrachial region</BrainRegion>(PBR) terminations. The dendrites of both thalamocortical cells and interneurons were stained for the muscarinic type 2(M2) receptors in both the glomerular and extraglomerular neuropil. However, the densest staining was found in glomerular gamma aminobutyric acid(GABA) ergic profiles that displayed the morphology associated with interneuron dendritic terminals (F2 profiles). Our data suggest that muscarinic type 2(M2) receptors play an important role both in blocking <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> spindle oscillations and in increasing the efficacy of signal transmission during increased attentional states.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Distribution of visual <BrainRegion>callosal</BrainRegion> neurons in normal and strabismic cats.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>It has been suggested that synchronous activation of <BrainRegion>cortical loci</BrainRegion> in the two <BrainRegion>cerebral hemispheres</BrainRegion> during development leads to the stabilization of juvenile <BrainRegion>callosal</BrainRegion> connections in some areas of the <BrainRegion>visual cortex</BrainRegion>. One way in which loci in opposite hemispheres can be synchronously activated is if they receive signals generated by the same stimulus viewed through different eyes. These ideas lead to the prediction that shifts in the <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> representation of the visual field caused by misalignment of the visual axes (strabismus) should change the width of the <BrainRegion>callosal zone</BrainRegion> in the <BrainRegion>striate cortex</BrainRegion>. We tested this prediction by using quantitative techniques to compare the tangential distribution of <BrainRegion>callosal</BrainRegion> neurons in the <BrainRegion>striate cortex</BrainRegion> of strabismic cats to that in normally reared cats. Animals were rendered strabismic surgically at 8-10 days of age and were allowed to survive a minimum of 18 weeks, at which time multiple intracortical injections of the tracer horseradish peroxidase (HRP) were used to reveal the distribution of <BrainRegion>callosally</BrainRegion> projecting cells in the <BrainRegion>contralateral striate cortex</BrainRegion>. horseradish peroxidase(HRP) -labeled cells were counted in <BrainRegion>coronal</BrainRegion> sections, and data from four animals with divergent strabismus (exotropia) and four with convergent strabismus (esotropia) were compared to those from four normally reared animals. Although our data from strabismic cats do not differ markedly from those reported previously, we find that the distribution of <BrainRegion>callosal</BrainRegion> cells in the <BrainRegion>striate cortex</BrainRegion> of these cats does not differ significantly from that in our normally reared control cats. These results do not bear out the prediction that surgically shifting the visual axes leads to stabilization of juvenile <BrainRegion>callosal</BrainRegion> axons in anomalous places within the <BrainRegion>striate cortex</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Genesis of the <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> pigment epithelium in the macaque monkey.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The development of the <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> pigment epithelium (RPE) was studied in rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta) fetuses, neonates, and juveniles exposed to a pulse of 3H-thymidine (3H-TdR) between embryonic day (E) 25 and postnatal day (P) 204 and examined at short and long intervals after the injection of the isotope. The <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> pigment epithelium(RPE) develops from the outer layer of the <BrainRegion>optic cup</BrainRegion> which by E45 consists of a multistratified epithelium. The outer layer appears immature near the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>&apos;s edge and gradually becomes monostratified and more mature centrally. Even at this early stage, all cells contain pigmented melanosomes, although peripherally the pigment is limited to the apical portion of the cells. Examination of autoradiograms from animals allowed to survive for several postnatal months shows that monkey <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> pigment epithelium(RPE) cell genesis begins just after E27, increasing to a peak frequency of 0.38 cells/mm at E43. Between E30 and E85 the density of radiolabelled cells varies within a restricted range of from 0.2 to 0.4 cells/mm (mean = 0.25 +/- 0.09). From the density of radiolabelled cells, and data on the overall density of <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> pigment epithelium(RPE) cells in the juvenile <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>, we determined the labelling index. During the first half of gestation, between 0.38% and 0.99% (mean = 0.65 +/- 0.22) of <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> pigment epithelium(RPE) cells are generated during the short interval of isotope availability after pulse injection. Approximately 5% of <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> pigment epithelium(RPE) cells were generated by E33, and 50% by E71. After E85, <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> pigment epithelium(RPE) cytogenesis begins gradually to decrease, and 95% of the cells have been generated by the time of birth. Continued, very low density (0.01 cells/mm) cytogenesis in the <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> pigment epithelium(RPE) is seen at P17, and persists at least until seven months postnatally. <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> pigment epithelium(RPE) cell genesis begins near the <BrainRegion>fovea</BrainRegion>, and proceeds towards the periphery. Cell division largely ceases in both <BrainRegion>foveal</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>perifoveal regions</BrainRegion> by E56, at which time labelled cells first begin to appear peripheral to the equator. Besides the timing differences, <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> pigment epithelium(RPE) genesis in the <BrainRegion>central retina</BrainRegion> differs from that in the <BrainRegion>peripheral retina</BrainRegion> in that it proceeds at a higher rate, and lasts for a shorter time period. A prolonged postnatal period of low density <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> pigment epithelium(RPE) cell genesis persists in both <BrainRegion>central and peripheral retina</BrainRegion>. Comparison of the pattern of expansion of the area containing radiolabelled cells in the <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> pigment epithelium(RPE) and <BrainRegion>neuroretina</BrainRegion> demonstrates a remarkable spatial and temporal correspondence. Close analysis suggests that at any point on the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>, the last cells are generated in the <BrainRegion>neuroretina</BrainRegion> slightly before the last cells in the <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> pigment epithelium(RPE) .</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Ultrastructure of afferents from the <BrainRegion>zona incerta</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>posterior and parafascicular thalamic nuclei</BrainRegion> of rats.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>We have examined the general ultrastructure of the <BrainRegion>posterior thalamic</BrainRegion> (Po) and <BrainRegion>parafascicular (Pf) nuclei</BrainRegion> of the <BrainRegion>dorsal thalamus</BrainRegion>, together with the ultrastructure of afferents to these nuclei from the <BrainRegion>zona incerta</BrainRegion> (ZI). The <BrainRegion>zona incerta</BrainRegion>(ZI) of Sprague-Dawley rats was injected with biotinylated dextran (BD) by using stereotaxic coordinates, and the brains were prepared for routine biotinylated dextran(BD) histochemistry. The <BrainRegion>posterior thalamic</BrainRegion>(Po) and <BrainRegion>parafascicular</BrainRegion>(Pf) were then dissected free and processed for electron microscopy by using standard methods. A survey of the general ultrastructure of <BrainRegion>posterior thalamic</BrainRegion>(Po) and <BrainRegion>parafascicular</BrainRegion>(Pf) revealed many RS profiles (small with round vesicles) making asymmetric synapses around single, small (distal; 0.5-1.5 microm in diameter) or larger (proximal; 2-4 microm in diameter) dendrites. RL (large with round vesicles) and F type (pleomorphic vesicles) profiles, although sparse, were also observed. Single round vesicles(RL) s were seen to envelope proximal dendrites and make asymmetric synapses that usually had a perforated appearance. F type profiles were seen to make symmetric synapses on proximal and sometimes distal dendrites. There were no profiles making synapses on other vesicle-filled profiles seen, reflecting the scarcity of interneurons in the <BrainRegion>posterior thalamic</BrainRegion>(Po) and <BrainRegion>parafascicular</BrainRegion>(Pf) of rats. Finally, biotinylated dextran(BD) -labeled terminal profiles from the <BrainRegion>zona incerta</BrainRegion>(ZI) formed a homogeneous population within both the <BrainRegion>posterior thalamic</BrainRegion>(Po) and <BrainRegion>parafascicular</BrainRegion>(Pf) . They were small (1.1 +/- 0.2 microm in diameter; n = 238), contained round vesicles, and made asymmetric synapses with proximal ( approximately 75%) and, to a lesser extent, distal ( approximately 25%) dendrites; they formed part of the RS population of the <BrainRegion>posterior thalamic</BrainRegion>(Po) and <BrainRegion>parafascicular</BrainRegion>(Pf) . In conclusion, our results indicate that the <BrainRegion>zona incerta</BrainRegion>(ZI) imparts a presumably excitatory (asymmetric synapses) input of high efficacy (preference for proximal dendrites) to the <BrainRegion>posterior thalamic</BrainRegion>(Po) and <BrainRegion>parafascicular</BrainRegion>(Pf) of the <BrainRegion>dorsal thalamus</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Somatosensory and motor representations in <BrainRegion>cerebral cortex</BrainRegion> of a primitive mammal (Monodelphis domestica): a window into the early evolution of <BrainRegion>sensorimotor cortex</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>To examine the potential early stages in the evolution of <BrainRegion>sensorimotor cortex</BrainRegion>, electrophysiological studies were conducted in the primitive South American marsupial opossum, Monodelphis domestica. Somatosensory maps derived from multiunit microelectrode recordings revealed a complete somatosensory representation of the contralateral body surface within a large region of <BrainRegion>midrostral cortex</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>primary somatosensory cortex</BrainRegion>, or S1). A large proportion ( approximately 51%) of <BrainRegion>S1</BrainRegion> was devoted to representation of the glaborous snout, mystacial vibrissae, lower jaw, and oral cavity (the rostrum). A second representation, the <BrainRegion>second somatosensory area</BrainRegion> (or S2), was found adjacent and caudolateral to <BrainRegion>S1</BrainRegion> as a mirror image reversed along the representation of the glabrous snout. A reversal of somatotopic order and an enlargement of receptive fields marked the transition from <BrainRegion>S1</BrainRegion> to <BrainRegion>S2</BrainRegion>. Mapping of excitable <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion> was conducted by using intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) techniques, as well as low-impedance depth stimulation and bipolar surface stimulation. In all three procedures, electrical stimulation resulted in movements confined strictly to the face. Specifically, at virtually all sites from which movements could be evoked, stimulation resulted in only vibrissae movement. intracortical microstimulation(ICMS) -evoked vibrissae movements typically occurred at sites within <BrainRegion>S1</BrainRegion> with receptive fields of the mystacial vibrissae, lower jaw, and glaborous snout. Results were similar using low-impedance depth stimulation and bipolar surface stimulation techniques except that the motor response maps were generally larger in area. There was no evidence of a motor representation rostral to <BrainRegion>S1</BrainRegion>. Examination of the cytoarchitecture in this <BrainRegion>cortical region</BrainRegion> (reminiscent of typical mammalian <BrainRegion>somatosensory cortex</BrainRegion>) and the high levels of stimulation needed for vibrissae movement suggest that the <BrainRegion>parietal neocortex</BrainRegion> of Monodelphis is representative of a primitive sensorimotor condition. It possesses a complete <BrainRegion>S1</BrainRegion> representation with an incomplete motor component overlapping the <BrainRegion>S1</BrainRegion> representation of the face. It contains no primary motor representation. Completion of the motor representations within <BrainRegion>S1</BrainRegion> (trunk, limbs, tail) as well as the emergence of a <BrainRegion>primary motor cortex</BrainRegion> rostral to <BrainRegion>S1</BrainRegion> may have occurred relatively late in mammalian phylogeny.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Comparison of alpha2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit mRNA expression in the central nervous system of rats and mice.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) alpha2 subunit was the first neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor(nAChR) to be cloned. However, data for the distribution of alpha2 mRNA in the rodent exists in only a few studies. Therefore, we investigated the expression of alpha2 mRNA in the rat and mouse central nervous systems using nonradioactive in situ hybridization histochemistry. We detected strong hybridization signals in cell bodies located in the internal plexiform layer of the <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>interpeduncular nucleus of the midbrain</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>ventral and dorsal tegmental nuclei</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>median raphe nucleus of the pons</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>ventral part of the medullary reticular nucleus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>ventral horn in the spinal cord</BrainRegion> of both rats and mice, and in a few Purkinje cells of rats, but not of mice. Cells that moderately express alpha2 mRNA were localized to the <BrainRegion>cerebral cortex</BrainRegion> layers V and VI, the <BrainRegion>subiculum</BrainRegion>, the oriens layer of <BrainRegion>CA1</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>medial septum</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>diagonal band complex</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>substantia innominata</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>amygdala</BrainRegion> of both animals. They were also located in a few midbrain <BrainRegion>nuclei</BrainRegion> of rats, whereas in mice they were either few or absent in these areas. However, in the <BrainRegion>upper medulla oblongata</BrainRegion> alpha2 mRNA was expressed in several large neurons of the <BrainRegion>gigantocellular reticular nucleus</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>raphe magnus nucleus</BrainRegion> of mice, but not of rats. The data obtained show that a similar pattern of alpha2 mRNA expression exists in both rats and mice, with the exception of a few regions, and provide the basis for cellular level analysis.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Patterns of SDF-1alpha and SDF-1gamma mRNAs, migration pathways, and phenotypes of CXCR4-expressing neurons in the developing rat <BrainRegion>telencephalon</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText><BrainRegion>Cortical</BrainRegion> GABAergic neurons originate in the <BrainRegion>ventral telencephalon</BrainRegion>, invade the <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion> via tangential migration, and integrate into the <BrainRegion>cortical plate</BrainRegion> by surface-directed and ventricle-directed migration. In mice lacking CXCR4 or SDF-1, GABAergic neurons fail to complete their migration. It is presently unknown which parts of the migration of CXCR4-expressing GABAergic neurons are driven by SDF-1. Here we compared patterns of SDF-1 isoforms and CXCR4 in the developing rat <BrainRegion>telencephalon</BrainRegion>. In the <BrainRegion>ventral telencephalon</BrainRegion>, radial glia, <BrainRegion>striatal</BrainRegion>, and migratory GABAergic neurons expressed CXCR4. Tangentially migrating CXCR4-expressing neurons populated the <BrainRegion>marginal zone</BrainRegion> and started to invade the <BrainRegion>lateral intermediate zone</BrainRegion> at embryonic day (E)14. Until E17 the spread of CXCR4-expressing neurons in the dorsomedial direction was accompanied by progressive upregulation of SDF-1alpha in the <BrainRegion>dorsomedial intermediate/subventricular zone</BrainRegion>. In the <BrainRegion>meninges</BrainRegion>, SDF-1alpha and SDF-1gamma were expressed persistently. During invasion of the <BrainRegion>cortical plate</BrainRegion> the orientation of CXCR4-immunoreactive neurons changed gradually from tangential (E17/E18) to radial (postnatal day [P] 0), which was paralleled by downregulation of SDF-1alpha in the <BrainRegion>intermediate/subventricular zone</BrainRegion>. At E17, CXCR4-immunoreactive cells were colabeled with markers for <BrainRegion>ventral forebrain</BrainRegion>-derived neurons (Dlx) but not markers for glutamatergic (Tbr) or subplate (calretinin) neurons. Postnatally, calretinin- and somatostatin-expressing but not parvalbumin-expressing GABAergic neurons or pyramidal cells contained CXCR4. Pyramidal cells and few large blood vessels expressed SDF-1alpha, while microvessels contained SDF-1gamma transcripts. In summary, SDF-1alpha is expressed along <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> but not <BrainRegion>subcortical</BrainRegion> migration routes of GABAergic neurons. We propose that regulated expression of SDF-1 in the <BrainRegion>intermediate/subventricular zone</BrainRegion> influences lateromedial tangential migration of CXCR4-expressing GABAergic neurons.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Ontogeny of the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>optic nerve</BrainRegion> in Xenopus laevis. II. Ontogeny of the optic fiber pattern in the retina.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The ontogeny of optic fiber patterns within the Xenopus laevis <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> has been studied in silver-stained serial sections and whole mounts. Ganglion cell axons (&quot;pioneers") appear much earlier than previously recognized, at Nieuwkoop-Faber ('56) Stage 28. Fibers fasciculate into bundles as they arise in the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> and reach the <BrainRegion>chiasma</BrainRegion> by NF Stage 32. Because the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> grows in rings at its margins, ganglion cell axons differentiate at the periphery and join the nearest fiber bundles (fascicles) to reach the <BrainRegion>optical disc</BrainRegion>. A radial fascicle pattern develops by Stage X (Grant et al., &apos;80) within the optic fiber layer of the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> and acts as a template of pathways that lead all later appearing fibers out of the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>. Since the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> grows asymmetrically along its dorso-ventral axis, the fascicle pattern develops asymmetrically, with dorsal quadrant fascicles forming an arcuate pattern in contrast to shorter, thicker ventral quadrant fascicles. The growth pattern of the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> and the &quot;principle" of fiber following suggest that "positional information" is acquired by ganglion cells according to a system of polar coordinates (MacDonald, '77). A radial distance "r" from the center is determined temporarily by ganglion cell birthday and an angular value "theta" is given by the angular position of the fascicle followed by its axons to the <BrainRegion>optical dis</BrainRegion>c. Wedges of ganglion cells send their axons into a common fascicle which retains its integrity as it leaves the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> at the <BrainRegion>optic disc</BrainRegion>. This pattern of optic fiber development suggests a model for retino-topic ordering of the optic fiber projection in Xenopus, with the fascicle acting as the &quot;pattern-forming unit of connectivity."</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Synaptic connection between <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> receptor cells and uniglomerular projection neurons in the antennal lobe of the American cockroach, Periplaneta americana.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Both antennal receptor cell axons and uniglomerular projection neurons of the antennal lobe were specifically labeled, and their synaptic relationship was studied at the fine structural level. The labelings were applied in different combinations: i) Experimentally induced anterograde degeneration of sensory-afferent axons was combined with injection of horseradish peroxidase into uniglomerular projection neurons. ii) Lucifer Yellow was injected into uniglomerular projection neurons, and receptor cell axons were anterogradely labeled with the lipophilic dye DiI. The fluorescent dyes were transformed by immuno- or photochemical treatment into electron-dense markers. In both types of preparations, a considerable number of monosynaptic output synapses from antennal receptor neurons onto processes of uniglomerular projection neurons were identified within the glomeruli of the lobe. In most cases, the receptor axon was connected in a dyadic fashion firstly to a process of a projection neuron and secondly to a nonlabeled process. The results clearly demonstrate a direct connection between receptor cells and output neurons of the cockroach antennal lobe which exists in parallel to the already proposed and demonstrated polysynaptic connection via inhibitory local interneurons.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Serotonin-immunoreactive neurons in the brain of the honeybee.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The distribution of serotonin-immunoreactive neurons in the brain of the worker honey bee Apis mellifera was studied by means of immunocytochemical staining by using a well-characterized antibody to serotonin (5-HT). About 75 immunoreactive perikarya are grouped into clusters in the <BrainRegion>optic lobe</BrainRegion> and in the <BrainRegion>median and dorsal protocerebrum</BrainRegion>. Immunoreactive fibers were resolved in all areas of the brain. The <BrainRegion>optic lobe</BrainRegion> shows restricted layers of 5-HT-immunoreactive fibers in the lamina and medulla organized perpendicular to the retinotopic elements. Immunoreactive fibers in the lobula represent invasions of <BrainRegion>protocerebral</BrainRegion> giant wide-field neurons. The nonglomerular neuropil of the brain exhibits a meshwork of immunoreactive fibres invading glomerular neuropil of the <BrainRegion>mushroom bodies</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>central body complex</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>antennal lobes</BrainRegion>. <BrainRegion>Mushroom body stalks and lobes</BrainRegion> contain immunoreactive fibers arranged perpendicular to the Kenyon cell fibers and matching subcompartments of these <BrainRegion>corpora pedunculata areas</BrainRegion>. The calyces are devoid of immunofluorescence. Serotonin-positive fibres in the <BrainRegion>central body complex</BrainRegion> are arranged in its subcompartments. No 5-HT immunoreactivity was found in the <BrainRegion>pons</BrainRegion>. Antennal glomeruli contain immunoreactive fibers restricted around the margin of the glomeruli. The selective mapping of 5-HT-immunoreactive neurons complements studies on the distribution of monoamine-containing neurons in the bee brain. Serotonin- and catecholamine-containing neurons often occur together in the same brain areas and subcompartments.

<ArticleTitle>Role of <BrainRegion>commissural</BrainRegion> projections in the representation of bilateral auditory space in the barn owl&apos;s <BrainRegion>inferior colliculus</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The <BrainRegion>central nucleus</BrainRegion> of the barn owl&apos;s <BrainRegion>inferior colliculus</BrainRegion> (ICc) contains a representation of both the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral and contralateral auditory hemifields</BrainRegion>. The representation of ipsilateral space is found in the &quot;core" of the <BrainRegion>inferior colliculus</BrainRegion>(ICc) , a subdivision defined by the terminal field of <BrainRegion>nucleus laminaris</BrainRegion>, the avian analogue of the <BrainRegion>medial superior olivary nucleus</BrainRegion>. The representation of contralateral space is found in the lateral portion of the &quot;shell" of the <BrainRegion>inferior colliculus</BrainRegion>(ICc) . The shell surrounds the core and is defined by the terminal field of the <BrainRegion>nucleus angularis</BrainRegion>, one of the <BrainRegion>cochlear nuclei</BrainRegion>. The representation of ipsilateral space in the core of the <BrainRegion>inferior colliculus</BrainRegion>(ICc) may be accounted for by the crossed projection from the <BrainRegion>nucleus laminaris</BrainRegion> because most of the <BrainRegion>nucleus laminaris</BrainRegion> is devoted to a representation of contralateral space. We present evidence to suggest that the representation of contralateral space is due to a <BrainRegion>commissural</BrainRegion> projection from the core of one side to the lateral shell of the opposite side. Injection of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) into the <BrainRegion>lateral portion of the inferior colliculus</BrainRegion>(ICc) shell produced retrogradely labeled somata in the core of the opposite side. Injection of tritiated proline into the core produced anterograde label confined to the lateral shell, thus confirming the observations made with horseradish peroxidase(HRP) . Thus, for example, the <BrainRegion>left inferior colliculus</BrainRegion>(ICc) core, which contains predominantly a representation of the left hemifield, innervates the right lateral shell, endowing it with a representation of the left, or contralateral hemifield. The representation of contralateral space in the lateral shell is ultimately conveyed to the <BrainRegion>external nucleus of the inferior colliculus</BrainRegion> where it contributes the horizontal axis to a two-dimensional map of space.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>NADPH-diaphorase localization in the CNS and peripheral tissues of the predatory sea-slug Pleurobranchaea californica.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The distribution of putative nitric oxide synthase (NOS)-containing cells in the opisthobranch mollusc Pleurobranchaea californica was studied histochemically via NADPH-diaphorase ( NADPH-diaphorase(NADPH-d) ) reduction of Nitro Blue Tetrazolium (NTB). Whole mounts and cryostat sections were prepared from the central nervous system and peripheral organs, including the buccal muscles, esophagus, salivary glands, foot, mantle, and gills. NADPH-diaphorase(NADPH-d) -positive neurons were localized predominantly to the buccal and pedal ganglia as well as to distinct areas of the cerebropleural and visceral ganglia. A variety of identified neurons were positive for NADPH-diaphorase(NADPH-d) iaphorase in various central ganglia, including the metacerebral cells of the cerebropleural ganglion, putative locomotor neurons of the pedal ganglia, and buccal motoneurons. Specific staining was observed only in somata of central neurons, whereas neuropil areas remained unstained. However, NADPH-diaphorase(NADPH-d) -reactive axons were dense in buccal ganglion nerves, whereas peripheral nerves and connectives of other ganglia had few or no NADPH-diaphorase(NADPH-d) positive terminals. In the periphery, NADPH-diaphorase(NADPH-d) activity was detected only in a few neurons of the rhinophore and tentacle ganglia. NADPH-diaphorase(NADPH-d) staining was marked in the salivary glands and gills, but there was no or very little staining in the esophagus, buccal mass, and foot. Histochemical stain production required the presence of both beta-NADPH and NBT; alpha-NADPH could not substitute for beta-NADPH. The inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase(NOS) , 2,6-dichlorophenol-indophenol, at 10(-3) M, totally abolished NADPH-diaphorase(NADPH-d) -positive staining. The apparent high activity of central NADPH-diaphorase(NADPH-d) contrasts with much lower activity in the ganglia of the related gastropod Tritonia. These data suggest a role for nitric oxide as a signal molecule in the central nervous system of Pleurobranchaea.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Colocalization of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitter markers in <BrainRegion>striatal</BrainRegion> projection neurons in the rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The principle neuronal output of the <BrainRegion>neostriatum</BrainRegion> comes from medium spiny neurons that project from the <BrainRegion>caudate/putamen</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>globus pallidus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>substantia nigra</BrainRegion>. Although current evidence generally indicates that gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the principal neurotransmitter in this pathway, this cannot account for the excitatory synaptic activity present among cultures of <BrainRegion>striatal</BrainRegion> neurons or the short latency excitatory postsynaptic potentials which often proceed or obscure inhibitory activity evoked by <BrainRegion>striatal</BrainRegion> stimulation. In this study, retrograde transport of [3H]D-aspartate has been used to demonstrate striato-pallidal and striato-nigral neurons that possess a high-affinity uptake system for glutamate and aspartate and are therefore putatively glutamatergic. Injections of [3H]D-aspartate into the <BrainRegion>globus pallidus</BrainRegion> or <BrainRegion>substantia nigra</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>pars reticularis</BrainRegion> of the rat retrogradely labeled medium-sized neurons throughout the <BrainRegion>rostral-caudal extent of the neostriatum</BrainRegion>. To characterize this population further, adjacent sections were immunoreacted with antibodies to either gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) , glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), calbindin, or parvalbumin prior to autoradiographic processing. Under these conditions, autoradiographically labeled neurons displayed positive immunoreactivity for gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) , glutamic acid decarboxylase(GAD) , or calbindin. Autoradiographic label did not colocalize with parvalbumin immunoreactivity. The colocalization of anatomical markers of gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) ergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission raises the possibility that both neurotransmitters are functionally expressed within single <BrainRegion>striatal</BrainRegion> projection neurons.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Cytochrome oxidase staining in the rat <BrainRegion>SmI barrel cortex</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Patterns of cytochrome oxidase (CO) activity were examined histochemically in the rat <BrainRegion>SmI cortex</BrainRegion>. Discrete regions of high enzymatic activity were centered upon the granule cell aggregates (barrels) in layer IV. Those barrels which correspond to the mystacial vibrissae and make up the <BrainRegion>posteromedial barrel subfield</BrainRegion> (PMBSF) were especially interesting in that cytochrome oxidase(CO) staining revealed distinct metabolic subdivisions which do not have an easily demonstrable cytoarchitectonic counterpart. By analogy with the barrels in mouse <BrainRegion>posteromedial barrel subfield</BrainRegion>(PMBSF) and with the cytoarchitectonically distinct barrels representing the smaller sinus hairs in the rat we propose that regions of high cytochrome oxidase(CO) activity denote the &quot;hollow" of the rat <BrainRegion>posteromedial barrel subfield</BrainRegion>(PMBSF) barrels. In accord with previous physiological studies demonstrating a vertical organization in the rodent <BrainRegion>barrel cortex</BrainRegion>, we also noted columns of intense cytochrome oxidase(CO) activity extending from layer VI through sublamina Vb. The centers of these columns coincided with the centers of the barrels in layer IV. In tangential sections through the infragranular laminae the segmentation of cytochrome oxidase(CO) -positive zones was less distinct than in layer IV and appeared as bands of heightened activity oriented like the five rows of layer IV barrels. Highly reactive somata and dendrites were observed in both the granular and infragranular cytochrome oxidase(CO) barrels indicating that some of the increased activity of these regions reflects oxidative metabolism of <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> neurons per se. These patterns of metabolic activity underscore the vertical and horizontal organization of the <BrainRegion>SmI vibrissa cortex</BrainRegion> and suggest that neurons located within the central core of a column have functional properties distinct from those located in zones where individual columns interface.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Zonal organization of climbing fiber projections to the <BrainRegion>uvula</BrainRegion> in the cat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Climbing fiber projections from the <BrainRegion>inferior olive</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>uvula of the cerebellum</BrainRegion> were studied in the cat by using retrograde axonal transport of horseradish peroxidase. Following large and small injections into various parts of the <BrainRegion>uvula</BrainRegion>, the distribution of labeled cells in the inferior olive was investigated. The findings indicate six longitudinal zones extending throughout the <BrainRegion>dorsal and ventral uvula</BrainRegion>: the <BrainRegion>caudal part of the nucleus beta</BrainRegion> projects to a most medially located zone (<BrainRegion>caudal beta zone</BrainRegion>) with a width of about 0.4 mm; the <BrainRegion>rostral part of the nucleus beta</BrainRegion> projects to a zone located at about 0.6 mm from the midline (<BrainRegion>rostral beta zone</BrainRegion>); the <BrainRegion>caudal part of the medial accessory olive</BrainRegion> (MAO) projects to a zone (<BrainRegion>caudal medial accessory olive(MAO) zone</BrainRegion>) located lateral to the <BrainRegion>rostral beta zone</BrainRegion>; the <BrainRegion>dorsomedial cell column</BrainRegion> projects to a zone (<BrainRegion>dorsomedial cell column zone</BrainRegion>) located in the <BrainRegion>intermediate part of the uvula</BrainRegion> at about 1.2 mm from the lateral edge of the <BrainRegion>uvula</BrainRegion>; the <BrainRegion>ventral lamella of the principal olive</BrainRegion> (PO) projects to a zone (<BrainRegion>ventral lamella of principal olive(PO) zone</BrainRegion>) about 0.7 mm from the lateral edge of the <BrainRegion>uvula</BrainRegion>; finally, the <BrainRegion>rostral part of the medial accessory olive</BrainRegion>(MAO) projects to the most lateral zone (<BrainRegion>rostral medial accessory olive(MAO) zone</BrainRegion>). These conclusions are in general agreement with those of earlier studies and also provide a more detailed zonal configuration of climbing fiber projections to the <BrainRegion>uvula</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<AbstractText>The central projections of muscle and cutaneous sensory neurons in the bullfrog were labeled by filling their peripheral axons in the forelimb with horseradish peroxidase (HRP). Muscle afferent fibers were found to project exclusively to the ventral neuropil of the <BrainRegion>brachial spinal cord in the intermediate gray zone</BrainRegion>. Cutaneous afferent axons had their arbors limited to the dorsal neuropil. There is therefore a topography in the central representation of two classes of sensory modalities.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Distribution of GAD-like immunoreactivity in the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> and central visual system of Rana pipiens.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Immunohistochemistry was used to survey the distribution of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), the synthesizing enzyme for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), throughout the visual system of the frog Rana pipiens. glutamic acid decarboxylase(GAD) -like immunoreactivity ( glutamic acid decarboxylase(GAD) -LI) was assessed in the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>, in primary retinorecipient targets, and in <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> nuclear groups postsynaptic to primary <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> terminal zones. Within the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>, the inner plexiform layer displayed intense glutamic acid decarboxylase(GAD) -LI, but immunoreactivity was absent in the ganglion cell layer (GCL). Putative amacrine, bipolar, and horizontal cell somata were also labeled. Centrally, glutamic acid decarboxylase(GAD) -LI was observed in all <BrainRegion>primary visual nuclei</BrainRegion>. Dense, glutamic acid decarboxylase(GAD) -like immunoreactive punctate structures ( punctate structures(puncta) ), presumably terminals, were observed in the <BrainRegion>pretectal nucleus</BrainRegion> lentiformis <BrainRegion>mesencephali</BrainRegion>, posterior <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> neuropil, and uncinate neuropil. glutamic acid decarboxylase(GAD) -like immunoreactive punctate structures(puncta) were noted in several laminae of the <BrainRegion>optic tectum</BrainRegion>, with the highest concentrations located within the 9th and 8th laminae. Moderate numbers of glutamic acid decarboxylase(GAD) -like immunoreactive punctate structures(puncta) were found in the <BrainRegion>mesencephalic nucleus</BrainRegion> of the <BrainRegion>basal optic root</BrainRegion>, and two <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> neuropils--<BrainRegion>corpus geniculatum</BrainRegion> and neuropil of Bellonci. The <BrainRegion>ventrolateral area</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>posterocentral nucleus</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>posterolateral nucleus</BrainRegion> all contained sparse amounts of glutamic acid decarboxylase(GAD) -LI. These observations suggest that gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) plays an important physiological role in all central visual areas of Rana pipiens.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Vesicle-associated membrane protein isoforms in the tiger salamander <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Vesicle associated membrane protein (VAMP; also known as synaptobrevin) is a key component of the core complex needed for docking and fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic plasma membrane. Recent work indicates that the precise complement of presynaptic proteins associated with transmitter release and their isoforms vary among synapses, presumably conferring specific functional release properties. The <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> contains two types of vesicular synapses with distinct morphologic, functional, and biochemical characteristics: ribbon and conventional synapses. Although the precise complement of presynaptic proteins is known to differ between conventional and ribbon synapses and among conventional synapses, the distribution of Vesicle associated membrane protein(VAMP) isoforms among <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> synapses has not been determined. The expression and localization of Vesicle associated membrane protein(VAMP) isoforms in the salamander <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>, a major model system for studies of <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> circuitry, was examined by using immunocytochemical and immunoblotting methods. Both methods indicated that at least two Vesicle associated membrane protein(VAMP) isoforms were expressed in salamander <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>. One isoform, recognized by an immunoglobulin M antibody that recognizes both mammalian Vesicle associated membrane protein(VAMP) -1 and Vesicle associated membrane protein(VAMP) -2, was associated with photoreceptor and bipolar cell terminals as well as many conventional synapses, and probably corresponds to mammalian Vesicle associated membrane protein(VAMP) -2. A different Vesicle associated membrane protein(VAMP) isoform associated with a subset of amacrine cells, was recognized only by antibodies directed against the N-terminus of mammalian Vesicle associated membrane protein(VAMP) -2. An antiserum directed against the N-terminus of mammalian Vesicle associated membrane protein(VAMP) -1 did not specifically recognize any salamander Vesicle associated membrane protein(VAMP) s in either immunocytochemical or immunoblotting experiments. Heterogeneous distribution of Vesicle associated membrane protein(VAMP) isoforms among conventional retinal synapses was confirmed by double labeling for synapsin I, a marker for conventional synapses. These studies indicate that Vesicle associated membrane protein(VAMP) isoforms are expressed heterogeneously among <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> synapses but cannot account for the differences in transmitter release characteristics at ribbon and conventional synapses. These results also corroborate previous studies in Xenopus indicating that the N-terminus of nonmammalian Vesicle associated membrane protein(VAMP) isoforms differs from their mammalian counterparts.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Early postnatal development of cholecystokinin-immunoreactive structures in the <BrainRegion>visual cortex</BrainRegion> of the cat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The early postnatal development of cholecystokinin-immunoreactive (CCK-ir) neurons was analyzed in <BrainRegion>visual areas 17</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>18</BrainRegion> of cats aged from postnatal day 0 to adulthood. Neurons were classified mainly by axonal criteria. According to their chronology of appearance neurons are grouped into three neuronal populations. The first population consists of five cell types which appear perinatally in <BrainRegion>areas 17</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>18</BrainRegion>. Four of them have axons terminating in layer VI. Neurons with columnar dendritic fields of layers IV and V display a conspicuous dendritic arborization with the long dendrites always arranged parallel to each other. This way they form a vertically oriented dendritic column. The neurons differentiate at around P 2 and are present until the end of the second postnatal week. They disappear possibly by degeneration and cell death. Multipolar neurons of layer VI have long dendrites and axonal domains of up to 800 micron in diameter. Three percent of these neurons send out two axons instead of only one. Neurons differentiate at P 0 and the cell type persists into adulthood. Bitufted to multipolar neurons of layer V constitute a frequent type; 10% of these cells issue two axons. They differentiate at P 2 and the type survives into adulthood. Bitufted to multipolar neurons of layers II/III appear at P 2 and send their axons into layer VI. So, early postnatally an axonal connection from superficial <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> layers to layer VI is established. The cell type persists into adulthood. The fifth cell type of the first population is constituted by the neurons of layer I with intralaminar axons which differentiate at P 2. Although they derive from the early marginal zone, the cell type survives into adulthood. The second population consists of two cell types which appear around the end of the second and during the third postnatal week in <BrainRegion>areas 17</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>18</BrainRegion>. Multipolar neurons of layer II have horizontally or obliquely arranged basket axons which, during the second postnatal month, form patches of high fiber and terminal density along the layer I/II border. Neurons with descending main axons issuing horizontal and oblique collaterals of layers II-IV form broad axonal fields. The third population in <BrainRegion>area 17</BrainRegion> is constituted by three cell types: Bitufted neurons with axons descending in form of loose bundles of layers II/III differentiate during the fifth postnatal week. Small basket cells of layers II/III with locally restricted axonal plexuses and somewhat larger basket cells of layer IV appear during the sixth and seventh week.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Generation of monoclonal antibodies against a nematode peptide extract: another approach for identifying unknown neuropeptides.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Monoclonal antibodies that cross-react with Ascaris neural antigens were generated in mice immunized with a conjugate made with keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) linked to a crude peptide extract from Caenorhabditis elegans. The response to keyhole limpet hemocyanin(KLH) was suppressed by injection of cyclophosphamide 3 days after immunization with a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)- keyhole limpet hemocyanin(KLH) conjugate. Screening of hybridomas was carried out by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and whole mount immunocytochemistry. Two similar clones produced antibodies that recognized a small subset of Ascaris neurons. This result suggests that the monoclonal antibody technique might be useful for identifying new neuropeptides since the antibodies can be used for localization of the neuropeptidelike substances and, potentially, for immunoaffinity chromatography. As a by-product of this experiment, monoclonal antibodies that recognize gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) -like immunoreactivity in whole mounts and plastic sections were also obtained.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Intrinsic connections within and between <BrainRegion>cochlear nucleus</BrainRegion> subdivisions in cat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The cat <BrainRegion>cochlear nuclear complex</BrainRegion> (CNC) is divided into three major subdivisions: the <BrainRegion>anteroventral</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>posteroventral</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>dorsal cochlear nuclei</BrainRegion> (AVCN, PVCN, and DCN, respectively). Each of these subdivisions receives a topographic projection from the <BrainRegion>cochlea</BrainRegion> and each consists of a number of different cell types. The interconnections between these subdivisions and the cell types which give rise to them were studied by means of small injections of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) made at physiologically identified locations. <BrainRegion>DCN</BrainRegion> injections resulted in few labeled cells in the <BrainRegion>DCN</BrainRegion>, suggesting that its internal connections are very limited. In contrast, these same <BrainRegion>DCN</BrainRegion> injections resulted in numerous labeled cells in the <BrainRegion>PVCN</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>AVCN</BrainRegion>. Labeled <BrainRegion>PVCN</BrainRegion> cells, consisting of multipolar, octopus, and small spindle-shaped cells, were located in spatially restricted laminae stretching the entire rostrocaudal length of the nucleus, while labeled <BrainRegion>AVCN</BrainRegion> cells consisting of multipolar, globular, small spindle-shaped and small spherical cells were broadly distributed over the posterior half of the nucleus. Similar injections placed in the <BrainRegion>PVCN</BrainRegion> resulted in numerous labeled cells in all three subdivisions. The <BrainRegion>PVCN</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>AVCN</BrainRegion> cells labeled after <BrainRegion>PVCN</BrainRegion> injections were widely distributed across the isofrequency representations in both nuclei, while the labeled <BrainRegion>DCN</BrainRegion> cells were restricted to locations over the injection sites. Injections placed in the <BrainRegion>posterior half of the AVCN</BrainRegion> resulted in only very few labeled cells in the <BrainRegion>DCN</BrainRegion>. No cells were labeled following injections in the <BrainRegion>rostral AVCN</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Spatial and temporal expression of short, long/medium, or both opsins in human fetal cones.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Human cone photoreceptors are characterized by long (L), medium (M), or short (S) wavelength-specific opsin. No reports have described the developmental pattern of human cone opsin expression, nor has the existence of human cones containing more than one opsin been tested. Single-and double-label immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization have been used to determine the developmental pattern of opsin appearance and to investigate the presence of double-labeled cones in sections and wholemounts of human fetal, neonatal, infant, and adult <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>. S opsin protein appears in and around the <BrainRegion>fovea</BrainRegion> at fetal week (Fwk) 10.9, whereas L/M opsin first appears in the <BrainRegion>fovea</BrainRegion> at fetal week(Fwk) 14-15. S opsin mRNA and protein are consistently detected much farther into <BrainRegion>peripheral retina</BrainRegion> than L/M opsin, indicating that S appears before L/M opsin. S cones cover 90% of the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> by fetal week(Fwk) 19. L/M cones appear outside the <BrainRegion>central retina</BrainRegion> by fetal week(Fwk) 21.5 and reach the <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> edge by fetal week(Fwk) 34-37. The spatial pattern of mRNA expression closely matches that for protein, but mRNA appears slightly earlier than protein at a given <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> point, indicating that only short delays occur between mRNA expression and translation into protein. Cones containing both S and L/M opsin (S+L/M) appear around the <BrainRegion>fovea</BrainRegion> shortly after L/M opsin is expressed, are found in more <BrainRegion>peripheral retina</BrainRegion> at older ages, and decrease in number after birth. Some S+L/M cones are still detected in adult <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>. Both S opsin protein and mRNA appear significantly earlier than L/M mRNA or protein across the human <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>, suggesting that the two cone types differentiate under independent controlling factors. However, the presence of single cones containing both S and L/M opsin during development suggests that human cones can respond to the factors controlling expression of each opsin.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Thin-section and freeze-fracture studies of crayfish stretch receptor synapses including the reciprocal inhibitory synapse.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The crayfish slow-adapting abdominal stretch receptor organ is innervated by three inhibitory and several excitatory axons. A previous study by Tisdale and Nakajima (&apos;76) showed that under certain fixation conditions inhibitory and excitatory synapses can be distinguished on the basis of synaptic vesicle structure. Using this morphological criterion we describe six types of synapses in the receptor: (1) the inhibitory axo-dendritic synapse, (2) the excitatory neuromuscular synapse, (3) the inhibitory neuromuscular synapse, (4) the axo-axonic synapse which suggests presynaptic inhibition of the excitatory synapse, (5) the axo-axonic synapse which suggests presynaptic inhibition on the inhibitory synapse, (6) the reciprocal inhibitory axo-axonic synapse, which is a new type of synapse. The presence of these six types of synapse suggest that inhibitory and excitatory axons interact synaptically in a complicated manner, resulting in a delicate control of receptor function. In freeze fracture we have observed the presynaptic membrane structures of inhibitory and excitatory synapses. The active zone of the inhibitory synapse has ridges with loosely aggregated particles on the tops of the ridges and indentations (vesicle attachment sites) along their sides. The active zone of the excitatory neuromuscular synapse consists of bands of particle aggregates which are situated on slightly elevated membrane regions and surrounded by wide, relatively particle-free, flat membrane areas.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Embryological origins and development of the rat diaphragm.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Textbooks of embryology provide a standard set of drawings and text reflecting the traditional interpretation of phrenic nerve and diaphragm development based on anatomical dissections of embryonic tissue. Here, we revisit this issue, taking advantage of immunohistochemical markers for muscle precursors in conjunction with mouse mutants to perform a systematic examination of phrenic-diaphragm embryogenesis. This includes examining the spatiotemporal relationship of phrenic axon outgrowth and muscle precursors during different stages of myogenesis. Additionally, mutant mice lacking c-met receptors were used to visualize the mesenchymal substratum of the developing diaphragm in the absence of myogenic cells. We found no evidence for contributions to the diaphragm musculature from the lateral body wall, septum transversum, or esophageal mesenchyme, as standard dogma would state. Nor did the data support the hypothesis that the crural diaphragm is of distinct embryological origins. Rather, we found that myogenic cells and axons destined to form the neuromuscular component of the diaphragm coalesce within the pleuroperitoneal fold (PPF). It is the expansion of these components of the pleuroperitoneal fold(PPF) that leads to the formation of the diaphragm. Furthermore, we extended these studies to examine the developing diaphragm in an animal model of congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH). We find that malformation of the pleuroperitoneal fold(PPF) mesenchymal substratum leads to the defect characteristic of congenital diaphragmatic hernia(CDH) . In summary, the data demonstrates that a significant revision of narratives describing normal and pathological development of the diaphragm is warranted.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Widespread distribution of histamine in the nervous system of a trematode flatworm.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>In general, most flatworms contain very little histamine (HA) and their nervous systems often lack, or contain very few, histaminergic elements. However, preliminary studies in our laboratory have revealed that the frog lung parasite, Haplometra cylindracea (Trematoda: Digenea), contains histamine(HA) in a very high concentration. For this reason, the present study was undertaken to study the localization and synthesis of histamine(HA) in this worm by using immunocytochemistry and high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). Essentially all parts of the nervous system of H. cylindracea showed histamine(HA) -like immunoreactivity. The paired <BrainRegion>cerebral ganglia</BrainRegion> and nerves emanating from these, including the longitudinal nerve cords, were intensely immunoreactive. The musculature of the pharynx, oral and ventral suckers, and those of the reproductive organs were all innervated by histamine(HA) -immunoreactive fibers. Fiber plexuses beneath the tegument and throughout the parenchyma also showed histamine(HA) -like immunoreactivity. high-pressure liquid chromatography(HPLC) studies revealed one of the highest histamine(HA) concentrations in the animal kingdom, 6.49 +/- 1.36 nmole/mg protein, in the worm. The frog lung and blood contained very low concentrations of histamine(HA) and could be excluded as sources for histamine(HA) , while an enzyme assay revealed that the worm produces histamine(HA) by decarboxylation of histidine. Thus, it is likely that H. cylindracea uses histamine(HA) as a neurotransmitter or modulator.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Organization of <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>basal forebrain</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>hypothalamic</BrainRegion> afferents to the <BrainRegion>parabrachial nucleus</BrainRegion> in the rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>In a previous study (Herbert et al., J. Comp. Neurol. [1990];293:540-580), we demonstrated that the ascending afferent projections from the <BrainRegion>medulla</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>parabrachial nucleus</BrainRegion> (PB) mark out functionally specific terminal domains within the <BrainRegion>parabrachial nucleus</BrainRegion>(PB) . In this study, we examine the organization of the <BrainRegion>forebrain</BrainRegion> afferents to the <BrainRegion>parabrachial nucleus</BrainRegion>(PB) . The <BrainRegion>parabrachial nucleus</BrainRegion>(PB) was found to receive afferents from the infralimbic, the <BrainRegion>lateral prefrontal</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>insular cortical areas</BrainRegion>; the <BrainRegion>dorsomedial</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>ventromedial</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>median preoptic</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>paraventricular hypothalamic nuclei</BrainRegion>; the <BrainRegion>dorsal, the retrochiasmatic, and the lateral hypothalamic areas</BrainRegion>; the <BrainRegion>central nucleus of the amygdala</BrainRegion>; the <BrainRegion>substantia innominata</BrainRegion>; and the <BrainRegion>bed nucleus of the stria terminalis</BrainRegion>. In general, <BrainRegion>forebrain areas</BrainRegion> tend to innervate the same <BrainRegion>parabrachial nucleus(PB) subnuclei</BrainRegion> from which they receive their input. Three major patterns of afferent termination were noted in the <BrainRegion>parabrachial nucleus</BrainRegion>(PB) ; these corresponded to the three primary sources of <BrainRegion>forebrain</BrainRegion> input to the <BrainRegion>parabrachial nucleus</BrainRegion>(PB) : the <BrainRegion>cerebral cortex</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>basal forebrain</BrainRegion>. <BrainRegion>Hypothalamic</BrainRegion> afferents innervate predominantly rostral portions of the <BrainRegion>parabrachial nucleus</BrainRegion>(PB) , particularly the <BrainRegion>central lateral and dorsal lateral subnuclei</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>basal forebrain</BrainRegion> projection to the <BrainRegion>parabrachial nucleus</BrainRegion>(PB) ends densely in the <BrainRegion>external lateral and waist subnuclei</BrainRegion>. <BrainRegion>Cortical</BrainRegion> afferents terminate most heavily in the <BrainRegion>caudal half of the parabrachial nucleus</BrainRegion>(PB) , particularly in the <BrainRegion>ventral lateral and medial subnuclei</BrainRegion>. In addition, considerable topography organization was found within the individual projections. For example, <BrainRegion>tuberal lateral hypothalamic</BrainRegion> neurons project heavily to the <BrainRegion>central lateral subnucleus</BrainRegion> and lightly to the <BrainRegion>waist area</BrainRegion>; in contrast, <BrainRegion>caudal lateral hypothalamic</BrainRegion> neurons send a moderately heavy projection to both the <BrainRegion>central lateral and waist subnuclei</BrainRegion>. Our results show that the <BrainRegion>forebrain</BrainRegion> afferents of the <BrainRegion>parabrachial nucleus</BrainRegion>(PB) are topographically organized. These topographical differences may provide a substrate for the diversity of visceral functions associated with the <BrainRegion>parabrachial nucleus</BrainRegion>(PB) .</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Time course and distribution of inflammatory and neurodegenerative events suggest structural bases for the pathogenesis of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Murine models of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) are important vehicles for studying the effects of genetic manipulation on disease processes related to multiple sclerosis (MS). Currently, a comprehensive assessment of encephalomyelitis(EAE) pathogenesis with respect to inflammatory and degenerating neuronal elements is lacking. By using Fluoro-jade histochemistry to mark neurodegeneration and dual immunostaining to follow T-cell, microglial, and vascular responses, the time course and distribution of pathological events in encephalomyelitis(EAE) was surveyed. C57BL/6J mice were killed at 7, 10, 14, 21 or 35 days after vaccination with the myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein peptide MOG(35-55). Disease onset occurred at day 14 and peaked at day 21. Early T-cell infiltration and microglial activation in periventricular and superficial white matter structures adjacent to <BrainRegion>meninges</BrainRegion> suggested initial recruitment of effector T cells via the <BrainRegion>cerebrospinal fluid</BrainRegion> and choroid plexus. This was associated with microglial activation at distal sites along the same white matter tracts, with subsequent vascular recruitment of T cells associated with further injury. Systematic examination of the entire CNS supported this two-step model of encephalomyelitis(EAE) pathogenesis, with inflammation and neurodegeneration commencing at similar times and affecting multiple levels of predominantly sensory central pathways, including their terminal fields. This included aspects of the visual, auditory/vestibular, somatosensory (lemniscal), and proprioceptive (spinocerebellar) systems. The early targeting of visual and periventricular structures followed by more widespread CNS involvement is consistent with common presenting signs in human multiple sclerosis(MS) patients and suggestive of a similar basis in neuropathology.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Interspecific variation in the projection of primary afferents onto the <BrainRegion>electrosensory lateral line lobe</BrainRegion> of weakly electric teleosts: different solutions to the same mapping problem.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>We demonstrate that preterminal axons composing the primary afferent projection onto the four somatotopically organized <BrainRegion>electrosensory lateral line lobe</BrainRegion> (ELL) segments in weakly electric gymnotiform teleosts course in fundamentally different directions in the most commonly studied species. Afferents enter the deep fiber layer (dfl) of the <BrainRegion>electrosensory lateral line lobe</BrainRegion>(ELL) and course in variable, but species-specific, directions within a horizontal plane before turning dorsally to terminate within the deep neuropil layer of the <BrainRegion>electrosensory lateral line lobe</BrainRegion>(ELL) (dnl). Among the species considered here, apteronotids exhibit the tightest projection pattern. Afferents enter the <BrainRegion>rostral electrosensory lateral line lobe</BrainRegion>(ELL) from the anterior lateral line nerve ganglion (ALLNG) in a nonsomatotopic fashion. As they course horizontally, these fibers undergo a rostrocaudal somatotopic sorting along the ventrolateral border of the deep fiber layer(dfl) , then turn within a horizontal plane to course medially across the <BrainRegion>electrosensory lateral line lobe</BrainRegion>(ELL) segments. These medially coursing horizontal fibers are sorted: they form sublaminae according to the nerve branch containing their peripheral axon. Horizontal axons then turn dorsally, form fascicles, and terminate within the deep neuropil layer of the ELL(dnl) . Within the dorsal fascicles, axons run directly into the deep neuropil layer of the ELL(dnl) with little deviation, and their terminal fields exhibit no appreciable spread. In sternopygids, deep fiber layer(dfl) horizontal fibers course in directions orthogonal to those in apteronotids. Fibers enter the <BrainRegion>rostral electrosensory lateral line lobe</BrainRegion>(ELL) and course medially across segments before turning caudally within segments. Unlike apteronotids, sternopygid horizontal fibers do not sort tightly by nerve branch. As horizontal axons turn dorsally they also form tight fascicles. But rather than terminating directly and without spreading, as in apteronotids, sternopygid fibers disperse from these fascicles and become sorted horizontally a second time prior to terminating in the deep neuropil layer of the ELL(dnl) .(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Direct catecholaminergic-cholinergic interactions in the <BrainRegion>basal forebrain</BrainRegion>. II. <BrainRegion>Substantia nigra-ventral tegmental area</BrainRegion> projections to cholinergic neurons.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Previous observations indicate that the <BrainRegion>basal forebrain</BrainRegion> receives dopaminergic input from the <BrainRegion>ventral midbrain</BrainRegion>. The present study aimed at determining the topographic organization of these projections in the rat, and whether this input directly terminates on cholinergic neurons. Injections of the anterograde tracer Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) into discrete parts of the <BrainRegion>ventral tegmental area</BrainRegion> (VTA) and the <BrainRegion>substantia nigra pars compacta</BrainRegion> (SNC) labeled axons and terminals in distinct parts of the <BrainRegion>basal forebrain</BrainRegion>, including <BrainRegion>medial and lateral septum</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>diagnoal band nuclei</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>ventral pallidum</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>globus pallidus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>substantia innominata</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>globus pallidus</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>internal capsule</BrainRegion>, where Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin(PHA-L) -labeled terminals abutted cholinergic (choline acetyltransferase = ChAT-containing) profiles. Three-dimensional (3-D) computerized reconstruction of immunostained sections clearly revealed distinct, albeit overlapping, subpopulations of ChAT-immunoreactive neurons apposed by Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin(PHA-L) -labeled input from <BrainRegion>medial vertical and horizontal diagonal band nuclei</BrainRegion>(VTA) (mainly in <BrainRegion>vertical and horizontal diagonal band nuclei</BrainRegion>), <BrainRegion>lateral vertical and horizontal diagonal band nuclei</BrainRegion>(VTA) and <BrainRegion>medial substantia nigra pars compacta</BrainRegion>(SNC) (<BrainRegion>ventral pallidum</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>anterior half of substantia innominata</BrainRegion>), and <BrainRegion>lateral substantia nigra pars compacta</BrainRegion>(SNC) (<BrainRegion>caudal half of the substantia innominata</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>globus pallidus</BrainRegion>). At the ultrastructural level, about 40% of the selected Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin(PHA-L) -labeled presynaptic terminals in the <BrainRegion>ventral pallidum</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>substantia innominata</BrainRegion> were found to establish synaptic specializations with ChAT-containing profiles, most of which on the cell body and proximal dendritic shafts. Convergent synaptic input of unlabeled terminals that formed asymmetric synapses with the ChAT-immunoreactive profiles were often found in close proximity to the Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin(PHA-L) -labeled terminals. These observations show that the cholinergic neurons in the <BrainRegion>basal forebrain</BrainRegion> are targ
ets of presumably dopaminergic <BrainRegion>substantia nigra pars compacta</BrainRegion>(SNC) / <BrainRegion>vertical and horizontal diagonal band nuclei</BrainRegion>(VTA) neurons, and suggest a direct modulatory role of dopamine in acetylcholine release in the <BrainRegion>cerebral cortical mantle</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Asymmetry of the olfactory system in the brain of the winter flounder, Pseudopleuronectes americanus.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Adult flatfishes exhibit grossly asymmetric external morphology. Even the <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> apparatus is asymmetric, being larger on the upward-facing side. We undertook the present study on the winter flounder, Pseudopleuronectes americanus, to examine whether the asymmetry of the peripheral olfactory system is maintained in its central organization. In winter flounder, the <BrainRegion>right olfactory organ</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>nerve</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>bulb</BrainRegion> are larger than the contralateral counterparts. In addition, the <BrainRegion>right telencephalon</BrainRegion> is about 8% larger than the left. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and degeneration techniques were used to trace the central connections of the <BrainRegion>olfactory bulbs</BrainRegion>. Neurons afferent to the <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> occur bilaterally in the <BrainRegion>telencephalon</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>mesencephalic tegmentum</BrainRegion>. Afferent neurons are also present at the junction between the <BrainRegion>posterodorsal bulb</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>telencephalon</BrainRegion>, in the <BrainRegion>basal preoptic region</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>nucleus of the posterior tuber</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>locus coeruleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>raphe nucleus</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>contralateral bulb</BrainRegion>. Each <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> projects bilaterally to several restricted areas of the <BrainRegion>telencephalon</BrainRegion>, the posterodorsal neurons of the <BrainRegion>nucleus preopticus</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>tuberal region</BrainRegion>, with ipsilateral connections being heavier in all areas. Corresponding to the differences in the <BrainRegion>peripheral olfactory apparatus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>central olfactory</BrainRegion> projections were also asymmetric. The <BrainRegion>right olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> projects to 2.6% of the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral telencephalon</BrainRegion> and 1.99% of the <BrainRegion>contralateral telencephalon</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>left bulb</BrainRegion> projects to 1.8% of the ipsilateral and 0.6% of the <BrainRegion>contralateral telencephalic hemisphere</BrainRegion>. Thus the <BrainRegion>left telencephalon</BrainRegion> receives roughly equal <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> input from the two sides, while the <BrainRegion>right telencephalon</BrainRegion> receives vastly more input from the <BrainRegion>right olfactory system</BrainRegion>. The asymmetry in the projections of the <BrainRegion>right and left bulbs</BrainRegion> may be due to differential postmetamorphic growth of the olfactory system on the two sides.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Growth-associated protein 43 immunoreactivity in the <BrainRegion>superficial dorsal horn</BrainRegion> of the rat <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> is localized in atrophic C-fiber, and not in sprouted A-fiber, central terminals after peripheral nerve injury.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Peripheral nerve injury induces the up-regulation in dorsal root ganglion cells of growth-associated protein 43 (GAP-43) and its transport to the superficial laminae of the <BrainRegion>dorsal horn of the spinal cord</BrainRegion>, where it is located primarily in unmyelinated axons and growth-cone like structures. Peripheral nerve injury also induces the central terminals of axotomized myelinated axons to sprout and form novel synaptic contacts in lamina II of the <BrainRegion>dorsal horn</BrainRegion>. To investigate whether the sprouting of A-fiber central terminals into lamina II is the consequence of growth-associated protein 43(GAP-43) incorporation into their terminal membranes, we have used an ultrastructural analysis with double labelling to identify the localization of growth-associated protein 43(GAP-43) immunoreactivity. Transganglionic transport of wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) was used to identify C-fiber terminals. Transganglionic transport of the B fragment of cholera toxin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (B-HRP) was used to label A-fiber sciatic nerve central terminals in combination with growth-associated protein 43(GAP-43) immunocytochemistry. growth-associated protein 43(GAP-43) was found to colocalize only with wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase(WGA-HRP) - and not with B-HRP-labelled synapses or axons. In addition, many single-labelled growth-associated protein 43(GAP-43) synapses were observed. Many of the wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase(WGA-HRP) -labelled terminals that were characterized by degenerative changes were growth-associated protein 43(GAP-43) immunoreactive. Our results indicate that peripheral nerve injury induces novel synapse formation of A fibers in lamina II but that up-regulated levels of growth-associated protein 43(GAP-43) are present mainly in other axon projections to the <BrainRegion>superficial dorsal horn</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>A light and electron microscopic study of the <BrainRegion>pineal</BrainRegion> in the blind goby, Typhlogobius californiensis (Pisces: Gobiidae).</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The <BrainRegion>pineal</BrainRegion> of the burrow-inhabiting, blind goby, Typhlogobius californiensis, was studied by light and electron microscopy. The two predominant cell types were photoreceptor and supportive cells. Ganglion cells could not be positively identified. The majority of photoreceptor cells had well developed outer segments and made apparent synaptic contact with nerve processes of unknown origin. Similar unmyelinated nerve fibers containing dense-cored vesicles were seen descending the <BrainRegion>pineal stalk</BrainRegion>. The cytoplasm of supportive cells contained several Golgi zones, occasional dense aggregations of smooth endoplasmic reticulum, abundant quantities of glycogen, some dense-cored vesicles and unusual rod crystalline inclusions measuring approximately 0.5 micrometer in width and 4-5 micrometer in length. These observations suggest that the <BrainRegion>pineal</BrainRegion> in this light-deprived species has retained its photoreceptive function and is a metabolically active organ which may also function in secretion.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>The distribution of oxytocin- and neurophysin-stained fibers in the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> of the rat and monkey.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Immunohistochemical methods have been used to describe the distribution of neurophysin I- and oxytocin-stained fibers in the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>. In albino rats of either sex, such fibers descend through the <BrainRegion>dorsal part of the lateral funiculus</BrainRegion> to the caudal end of the cord. Fibers leave the <BrainRegion>lateral funiculus</BrainRegion> to innervate the <BrainRegion>marginal zone of the dorsal horn</BrainRegion> at all levels, and the <BrainRegion>intermediolateral column at thoracic, lumbar and sacral levels</BrainRegion>. Some fibers course medially through the <BrainRegion>intermediate gray</BrainRegion> to end in the <BrainRegion>central gray</BrainRegion>, which is innervated at all levels, and also appears to be innervated by fibers descending in the <BrainRegion>central gray</BrainRegion> itself. A semiquantitative analysis shows that the density of terminal fields in the <BrainRegion>intermediolateral column</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>marginal zone</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>central gray</BrainRegion> varies significantly at different levels. The <BrainRegion>intermediolateral column</BrainRegion> is preferentially innervated between T1-T3, T9-T11, and T13-L2. The <BrainRegion>nucleus intercalatusspinalis</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>dorsal commissural nucleus</BrainRegion> (between T13 and L2), both of which contain preganglionic neurons, are densely innervated. In the monkey (Macaca fascicularis), neurophysin I- and oxytocin-stained fibers descend through the <BrainRegion>lateral funiculus</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>filum terminale</BrainRegion>, where some of them enter the <BrainRegion>pia-arachnoid</BrainRegion> surrounding the <BrainRegion>filum</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>intermediolateral column</BrainRegion> is not innervated between T1-T3, is sparsely innervated at sacral levels, and is moderately innervated between T4 and L3; the greatest density of fibers occurs at L3. At most levels, few if any fibers are found in the <BrainRegion>central gray</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>marginal zone</BrainRegion>; the <BrainRegion>central gray</BrainRegion> is sparsely innervated between T8 and L2 at S2, and between Co3-Co6, and the <BrainRegion>marginal zone</BrainRegion> contains a small number of fibers in the region of S2 and Co6. Neurophysin I- and oxytocin-stained fibers were also found in the <BrainRegion>intermediolateral column</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>marginal zone</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>central gray</BrainRegion> of homozygous Brattleboro, spontaneously hypertensive, and Egyptian sand rats. The results suggest that the paraventriculo-spinal pathway is particularly related to specific groups of sympathetic and parasympathetic preganglionic neurons, and to the <BrainRegion>marginal zone</BrainRegion>, whick is involved in the relay of ascending nociceptive information through the <BrainRegion>spinothalamic</BrainRegion> tract.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Phylogenetic changes in the expression of delta opioid receptors in <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> and dorsal root ganglia.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>To assess the validity of rodent models for investigating the role of delta opioid receptors (DOR) in analgesia, the distribution of delta opioid receptors(DOR) binding and mRNA were compared between rodent and primate <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> and dorsal root ganglia (DRG), using receptor autoradiography and in situ hybridization, respectively. In mouse and rat <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>, [(125)I]-deltorphin-labeled delta opioid receptors(DOR) binding sites were detected throughout the <BrainRegion>gray matter</BrainRegion>. In contrast, in primate and particularly in human <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>, delta opioid receptors(DOR) binding was mainly present in laminae I-II, with little to no binding in deeper layers. Accordingly, in rodent <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>, delta opioid receptors(DOR) mRNA was expressed by a large number of neurons distributed throughout the <BrainRegion>ventral and dorsal horns</BrainRegion>, whereas in the primate, delta opioid receptors(DOR) expression was significantly lower, as evidenced by a moderate number of labeled cells throughout the <BrainRegion>gray matter</BrainRegion> in monkey and by only few labeled cells in human, mainly in <BrainRegion>Clarke&apos;s column</BrainRegion> and lamina IX. Major species differences in delta opioid receptors(DOR) expression were also observed in primary afferent cells bodies. In rat dorsal root ganglia(DRG) , intense delta opioid receptors(DOR) mRNA hybridization was primarily observed over large ganglion cells immunopositive for neurofilament 200. In contrast, in monkey and human dorsal root ganglia(DRG) , delta opioid receptors(DOR) mRNA was primarily detected over small and medium-sized ganglion cells. These results demonstrate major differences in the expression and distribution of delta opioid receptors(DOR) in the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> and dorsal root ganglia(DRG) between mammalian species. Specifically, they point to a progressive specialization of delta opioid receptors(DOR) toward the regulation of primary somatosensory, namely nociceptive, inputs during phylogeny and suggest that the effects of delta opioid receptors(DOR) agonists in rodents may not be entirely predictive of their action in humans.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Ultrastructural characterization of the <BrainRegion>accessory lobes of Lachi</BrainRegion> in the <BrainRegion>lumbosacral spinal cord</BrainRegion> of the pigeon with special reference to intrinsic mechanoreceptors.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The lumbosacral spinal cord of birds is unique among vertebrates in that segmentally organized <BrainRegion>accessory lobes</BrainRegion> protrude from the <BrainRegion>ventrolateral spinal cord</BrainRegion> into the <BrainRegion>vertebral canal</BrainRegion>. Recently, it has been suggested that these lobes may be part of an extralabyrinthine sense organ of equilibrium. For a better understanding of such a function, a complete analysis of the structural basis was performed by means of electron microscopy. The lobes consist of multipolar neurons, myelinated and unmyelinated axons, glia-derived glycogen cells, glial cells, and capillaries. The dorsal part of the lobe is covered by a loose mesh of <BrainRegion>pia mater</BrainRegion>. Ventrolaterally, an <BrainRegion>arachnoidal trabecle</BrainRegion> is in close contact with the lobe. Extracellular lacunae extend from the periphery deep into each lobe. The lacunae are separated from the <BrainRegion>subarachnoidal space</BrainRegion> by a loose mesh of processes of the glycogen cells with its basal lamina. The lacunae are filled by a network of processes of glycogen cells, glial cell, dendrites, and small axons. Both neuronal somata and dendrites are contacted by numerous axon terminals that form rather uniform synapses. Finger-like processes emerge from both the somata and the dendrites. The dendrites branch deeply into the extracellular lacunae and form lateral ramifications, which consist of narrow stalks with serially arranged bulbous portions, from which finger-like processes emerge. Finger-like processes are well-known elements in mechanotransduction. Glycogen cells and lacunae may contribute to transmission of hydrostatic pressure changes during movements of the body.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Distribution and spatial geometry of dopamine interplexiform cells in the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>. II. External arborizations in the adult rat and monkey.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The morphology and distribution of dopaminergic interplexiform cells in adult rat and monkey <BrainRegion>retinas</BrainRegion> were analyzed to determine any correlation with the function of dopamine in the outer <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> layers. The <BrainRegion>retinas</BrainRegion> were processed as whole mounts for tyrosine hydroxylase immunohistochemistry. There was a network formed by the sclerally directed processes of interplexiform cells in the inner nuclear, outer plexiform, and outer nuclear layers running throughout the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>. Their density was higher in the <BrainRegion>superior retina</BrainRegion> than in the <BrainRegion>inferior retina</BrainRegion> of the rat and was especially high in the superior temporal quadrant. The external network in this quadrant was significantly less dense in the monkey than in the rat, as are the interplexiform cells. The somata of interplexiform and other dopaminergic cells were about the same size in both rats and monkeys. Computer-assisted reconstruction of external arborizations of individual cells showed that external processes lay very close to horizontal and photoreceptor cells and also to blood capillaries. Because they were long, thin, and highly varicose; branched at right angles; and often arose from an axon hillock, the external processes were identified as axons. Therefore, we define the dopaminergic interplexiform cells as multiaxonal neurons, with at least one outwardly directed axon that reaches the outer plexiform layer. The function of the network of external processes from the interplexiform dopaminergic cells is discussed in terms of modulating the release of dopamine to external layers.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Expression of Islet1 marks the sensory and neuronal lineages in the mammalian <BrainRegion>inner ear</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Several basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) genes have been shown to be essential for the generation of the auditory sensory hair cells or the spiral ganglion (SG) neurons that innervate the hair cells in the <BrainRegion>cochlea</BrainRegion>, as well as a variety of cell types in the other nervous systems. However, it remains elusive what cellular context-dependent mechanisms confer the <BrainRegion>inner ear</BrainRegion>-specific neuronal or sensory competency/identities. We explored the possibility that one of the mechanisms responsible for generating cellular diversity in the nervous system through cooperative action of basic helix-loop-helix(bHLH) and LIM-homeodomain (LIM-HD) transcriptional factors might also contribute to the inner ear-specific sensory and/or neuronal competency. Here, we show that Islet1 (Isl1), a LIM-homeodomain(LIM-HD) protein, is expressed early in the otocyst in the region that gives rise to both the auditory sensory organ, the <BrainRegion>organ of Corti</BrainRegion>, and spiral ganglion(SG) neurons. Subsequently, the expression of Islet1(Isl1) is maintained in spiral ganglion(SG) neurons but is transitory in the sensory lineage. At embryonic day 12 (E12) in mice, the expression of Islet1(Isl1) marks distinctively the ventral portion of the nascent <BrainRegion>cochlear</BrainRegion> epithelium encompassing the primordial <BrainRegion>organ of Corti</BrainRegion>. At E13, Islet1(Isl1) is maintained at relatively high levels in the sensory primordium while down-regulated in the other regions of the <BrainRegion>cochlear duct</BrainRegion>. As the sensory epithelium starts to differentiate, it is down-regulated in the entire <BrainRegion>cochlear</BrainRegion> epithelium. The expression of Islet1(Isl1) in the developing <BrainRegion>inner ear</BrainRegion> reveals an early and likely a common step in the development of both sensory and neuronal lineages of the <BrainRegion>inner ear</BrainRegion>, and suggests its potential role in the <BrainRegion>inner ear</BrainRegion>-specific sensory and neuronal cell development.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Primary <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> motor neurons undergo apoptosis after axotomizing <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> injury.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText><BrainRegion>Spinal cord</BrainRegion> injury (SCI) results in loss of voluntary motor control followed by incomplete recovery, which is partly mediated by the descending corticospinal tract (CST). This system is an important target for therapeutic repair strategies after <BrainRegion>Spinal cord</BrainRegion> injury(SCI) ; however, the question of whether apoptotic cell death occurs in these axotomized neurons remains unanswered. In this study, adult (150-175 g) male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent T9 transection of the <BrainRegion>dorsal funiculus</BrainRegion>, which axotomizes the dorsal corticospinal tract(CST) , and introduction of the retrograde tracer Fluoro-Gold into the lesion site. Primary motor cortex (M1) was then examined for evidence of apoptosis weekly for 4 weeks after injury. Axotomized pyramidal cells, identified by retrograde transport of Fluoro-Gold, were found in M1 (57.5 +/- 9.6/median section, 6127 +/- 292 total), and a significant proportion were terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) -mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUTP)-rhodamine nick end labeling (TUNEL) -positive at 1 week after injury (39.3 +/- 5.6%), compared with animals undergoing sham surgery (1.2 +/- 1.4%). At 2-4 weeks, fewer cells were Fluoro-Gold-positive (24.6 +/- 65.06 to 25.3 +/- 6.4/median section, 2338 +/- 233 to 2393 +/- 124 total), of which very few were TUNEL-positive. In TUNEL-positive cells, Hoechst 33342 staining revealed nuclear morphology consistent with apoptosis, chromatin condensation, and formation of apoptotic bodies. Fluoro-Gold-positive cells showed increased caspase-3 and Bax immunoreactivity. Hematoxylin and eosin staining revealed similar nuclear changes and dystrophic cells. Internucleosomal DNA fragmentation was detected by gel electrophoresis at the 1-week time point. Lesioned animals not receiving Fluoro-Gold exhibited the same markers of apoptosis. These results document, for the first time, features of apoptotic cell death in a proportion of axotomized <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> motor neurons after <BrainRegion>Spinal cord</BrainRegion> injury(SCI) , suggesting that protection from apoptosis may be a prerequisite for regenerative approaches to <BrainRegion>Spinal cord</BrainRegion> injury(SCI) .</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Chemical anatomy of excitatory endings in the <BrainRegion>dorsal cochlear nucleus</BrainRegion> of the rat: differential synaptic distribution of aspartate aminotransferase, glutamate, and vesicular zinc.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>In order to identify cytochemical traits relevant to understanding excitatory neurotransmission in <BrainRegion>brainstem auditory nuclei</BrainRegion>, we have analyzed in the <BrainRegion>dorsal cochlear nucleus</BrainRegion> the synaptic distribution of aspartate aminotransferase, glutamate, and vesicular zinc, three molecules probably involved in different steps of excitatory glutamatergic signaling. High levels of glutamate immunolabeling were found in three classes of synaptic endings in the <BrainRegion>dorsal cochlear nucleus</BrainRegion>, as determined by quantitation of immunogold labeling. The first type included auditory nerve endings, the second were granule cell endings in the molecular layer, and the third very large endings, better described as &quot;mossy." This finding points to a neurotransmitter role for glutamate in at least three synaptic populations in the <BrainRegion>dorsal cochlear nucleus</BrainRegion>. The same three types of endings enriched in glutamate immunoreactivity also contained histochemically detectable levels of aspartate aminotransferase activity, suggesting that this enzyme may be involved in the synaptic handling of glutamate in excitatory endings in the <BrainRegion>dorsal cochlear nucleus</BrainRegion>. There was also extrasynaptic localization of the enzyme. Zinc ions were localized exclusively in granule cell endings, as determined by a Danscher-selenite method, suggesting that this ion is involved in the operation of granule cell synapses in the <BrainRegion>dorsal cochlear nucleus</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Action and location of neuropeptide tyrosine (Y) on <BrainRegion>hippocampal</BrainRegion> neurons of the rat in slice preparations.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The action of bath applied NPY (1-1,000 nM) was investigated on <BrainRegion>hippocampal</BrainRegion> slices of the rat with extra- and intracellular recording. Neuropeptide Y ( Neuropeptide Y(NPY) ) at 10-1,000 nM caused a concentration-dependent, long-lasting reduction of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) in the <BrainRegion>hippocampal subfield CA1</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>area dentata</BrainRegion>, and an even stronger reduction of population spikes. Paired pulse experiments with low intensity, stimulation-evoked PSPs showed a marked increase in facilitation in the presence of Neuropeptide Y(NPY) , indicating a presynaptic action. Spontaneous burst firing of <BrainRegion>CA1</BrainRegion> pyramidal cells in low calcium, high magnesium medium was reduced, indicating a partially postsynaptic inhibitory action of Neuropeptide Y(NPY) on their dendrites. Intracellular recording from <BrainRegion>CA1</BrainRegion> somata during Neuropeptide Y(NPY) administration revealed a reduction of the amplitudes of excitatory-inhibitory postsynaptic potential (EPSP-IPSP) sequences in the absence of changes in membrane potential and conductance. Accommodation of firing during long depolarizing pulses and afterhyperpolarizations were unchanged. The innervation pattern of Neuropeptide Y(NPY) immunoreactive fibers in the same regions was studied in slices adjacent to the ones used for electrophysiology by using antisera against Neuropeptide Y(NPY) and light and electron microscopy. There is a dense innervation of <BrainRegion>CA1</BrainRegion> by Neuropeptide Y(NPY) -immunoreactive axons and terminals, particularly in the <BrainRegion>stratum moleculare</BrainRegion>. Neuropeptide Y(NPY) -immunoreactive neurons are present in the <BrainRegion>stratum oriens and pyramidale</BrainRegion>. The Neuropeptide Y(NPY) labeled axons of the <BrainRegion>stratum moleculare</BrainRegion> participate in numerous synaptic contacts with the smaller dendritic elements in this layer, many of which belong to pyramidal neurons. These observations provide evidence for a dendritic Neuropeptide Y(NPY) -immunoreactive innervation of <BrainRegion>CA1</BrainRegion> neurons, which is in keeping with the electrophysiological effects of Neuropeptide Y(NPY) on pyramidal neurons.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Enhanced early developmental expression of the metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR5 in rat brain: protein, mRNA splice variants, and regional distribution.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Glutamate stimulates phosphatidyl inositol hydrolysis and mobilizes intracellular calcium through the mediation of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), in particular the &quot;Group I" receptors metabotropic glutamate receptors(mGluRs) , mGluR1, and mGluR5. This activity is markedly enhanced in developing brain relative to the adult. To determine whether this may be due to an increased amount of mGluR5 present in the developing brain, we examined mGluR5 expression using western blotting to measure mGluR5 protein reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to measure mGluR5 mRNA, and immunocytochemistry to assess the regional distribution of mGluR5 morphologically. Western blotting revealed that in all brain regions examined there is more mGluR5 protein present in developing brain than in the adult. In most regions, the developmental decrease was over two-fold. Total mGluR5 mRNA also decreased with development in most regions, but to a much lesser extent than the protein, suggesting that there is considerable post-transcriptional regulation of the expression of this receptor. reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction(RT-PCR) analysis also demonstrated that in most regions the mGluR5a splice variant is most abundant in the young animals but mGluR5b predominates in the adult. Light microscopic immunocytochemistry indicated that expression is widespread in developing brain, and that the developmental decrease in receptor concentration is due to both an increased growth of receptor-poor tissue regions and decreased expression within receptor-rich regions.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Identification of NPY-induced c-Fos expression in <BrainRegion>hypothalamic</BrainRegion> neurones projecting to the <BrainRegion>dorsal vagal complex</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>lower thoracic spinal cord</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Neuropeptide Y exerts profound effects on body weight and glucose homeostasis. We have investigated the effect of centrally administered neuropeptide Y on the activity of descending neurones of the <BrainRegion>hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus</BrainRegion> by combining retrograde tract tracing with c-Fos immunocytochemistry. Male rats were injected with True Blue into the <BrainRegion>dorsal vagal complex</BrainRegion> and with FluoroGold into the <BrainRegion>intermediolateral column of the lower thoracic spinal cord</BrainRegion>. One week after the last surgical procedure, animals were injected centrally with an orexigenic dose of neuropeptide Y (5 microg) and sacrificed 60 to 240 minutes following this injection. Temporal analysis of NPY-induced c-Fos expression showed a peak at 90 minutes, which was nearly returned to basal levels between 120 and 240 minutes. Expression of c-Fos was prominent in several of the <BrainRegion>subnuclei of the paraventricular nucleus</BrainRegion> and in the adjacent <BrainRegion>perifornical nucleus</BrainRegion>. Neurones projecting to the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> were prominent in the <BrainRegion>dorsal, lateral, and ventral portion of the medial parvicellular subnuclei of the PVN</BrainRegion>. About 15% of <BrainRegion>IML</BrainRegion> projecting neurones of the <BrainRegion>medial parvicellular subnucleus</BrainRegion> were Fos-positive, whereas less than 5% of <BrainRegion>IML</BrainRegion> projecting neurones from other subnuclei were Fos-positive. Hardly any <BrainRegion>PVN</BrainRegion> neurones projecting to the <BrainRegion>dorsal vagal complex</BrainRegion> were concomitantly Fos-positive. A considerably larger (&amp;gt;10%) proportion of <BrainRegion>perifornical</BrainRegion> neurones projecting to the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion> were c-Fos-immunopositive. In conclusion, NPY induces c-Fos in <BrainRegion>paraventricular</BrainRegion> neurones projecting to <BrainRegion>intermediolateral column of the spinal cord</BrainRegion> and in neurones of the <BrainRegion>perifornical nucleus</BrainRegion> projecting to the <BrainRegion>dorsal vagal complex</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>LHRH and catecholamine neuronal systems in the <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> of the mouse.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The luteinizing-hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) components of the mouse olfactory system were studied by using the indirect immunohistofluorescence technique. luteinizing-hormone-releasing hormone(LHRH) -positive cell bodies were found in both the <BrainRegion>main olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> (MOB) and the <BrainRegion>accessory olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> (AOB); two distinct cell groups were found--one located adjacent to the <BrainRegion>accessory olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>(AOB) in the <BrainRegion>dorsal part of the main olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>(MOB) and a second in the <BrainRegion>superficial ventromedial aspect of the main olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>(MOB) . luteinizing-hormone-releasing hormone(LHRH) -positive fibers were found predominantly in the <BrainRegion>posterior half of the main olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> innervating the <BrainRegion>olfactory nerve</BrainRegion> layer, the glomerular layer, the external plexiform layer, and the mitral cell layer, and small numbers innervated the <BrainRegion>accessory olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>(AOB) . The greatest density of luteinizing-hormone-releasing hormone(LHRH) -immunoreactive fibers was seen adjacent to the <BrainRegion>accessory olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>(AOB) where one group of luteinizing-hormone-releasing hormone(LHRH) -positive cells was noted. Sections adjacent to those stained with luteinizing-hormone-releasing hormone(LHRH) antibody were analysed for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH). The tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) staining was intense for both cells and fibers in the glomerular layer of the <BrainRegion>main olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>(MOB) . In the <BrainRegion>accessory olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>(AOB) lower numbers of cell bodies and fibers were seen in the glomerular layer. The internal granular layer and internal plexiform layers were both stained, the internal granular layer showing more intensely fluorescent fibers with a higher density. Since no overlapping dopamine beta-hydroxylase(DBH) -positive fibers were found here, these tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) -positive nerve endings may be dopaminergic. dopamine beta-hydroxylase(DBH) staining was confined to sparse networks of weakly fluorescent fibers with the highest numbers in the internal plexiform layer of the <BrainRegion>accessory olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>(AOB) and fewer fibers in the external plexiform, rostral, and granular layers of the <BrainRegion>main olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>(MOB) . Elution-restaining experiments revealed that the luteinizing-hormone-releasing hormone(LHRH) -positive and tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) -positive elements represent different cell populations.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Counting sectioned cells via mathematical reconstruction.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>A new method for determining the number of neurons in sectioned tissue is presented. The method does not involve identification of subcellular structures; rather, it uses estimates of the mean diameters of sections of the neuronal somata (with or without nuclei). All such sections are termed profiles. A mathematical model is developed to reconstruct the cell population from a size histogram of the profiles. Although the model is simple, the calculations are numerous and best done on a computer. A program that performs these calculations is provided. We discuss the idealizations on which the model is based and test the method in various ways: on hand- and computer-generated data in which imaginary spheres of known size were sectioned; on two small samples of real cells for which both cell and profile size histograms were available; and on a sample of potatoes, sliced by hand. In every case the estimate was within 10% of the actual number of cells (or potatoes). The method is robust in that it is relatively insensitive to section thickness, sample size, somal morphology, and observer error with respect to missing the small or thin profiles from any given cell. Results from the present model are compared to those obtained by using other cell count correction schemes that are currently employed. We call our method recursive translation.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Retinal</BrainRegion> synaptic arrays: continuing development in the adult goldfish.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>We report a light- and electron-microscopic examination of the inner plexiform layer of the <BrainRegion>central retina</BrainRegion> of young (c. 1 year) and old (3-4 year) goldfish. There were no new neurons added to this region during the growth period. Nonetheless, there were substantially more synapses (per cell, per mm2, or per degree 2) in the older <BrainRegion>retinas</BrainRegion>. This result is discussed in the contexts of <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> function and neural development.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Enhancing axon regeneration in peripheral nerves also increases functionally inappropriate reinnervation of targets.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The specificity of reinnervation of peripheral targets by regenerating motor axons was studied in mice by using retrograde fluorescent tracers applied to the cut ends of the tibial and common fibular nerves after transection and surgical repair of the sciatic nerve. When the nerve ends were aligned and secured with fibrin glue, more motoneurons labeled after application of tracer to the common fibular nerve were found in regions of the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> that normally contain only tibial motoneurons. The magnitude of such inappropriate reinnervation did not change at different times after repair. Intentional misalignment of the cut nerve stumps at the time of repair resulted in more extensive inappropriate reinnervation of the different peripheral targets. If the proximal stump of the cut nerve was electrically stimulated at the time of repair, if the distal stump was treated with chondroitinase ABC, or if both protocols were applied, the number of motoneurons labeled was increased. This increase was accompanied by more extensive reinnervation of inappropriate targets than found after untreated nerve repair. Although alterations in the caudorostral distributions of labeled motoneurons observed were not as great as observed after purposeful misalignment of the cut nerve ends, the topographic relationship between the spinal locations of motoneuron somata and the peripheral targets of their axons is disrupted. Enhancement of motor axon regeneration by induction of growth-promoting signaling pathways, reduction in growth inhibition in the environment of regenerating axons, or both, is accompanied by an increase in the amount of functionally inappropriate reinnervation of peripheral targets.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Distribution of neuropeptide immunoreactive nerve terminals within the <BrainRegion>subnuclei of the nucleus of the tractus solitarius</BrainRegion> of the rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The location of substance P, enkephalin and somatostatin (SRIF), and neurophysin II immunoreactive nerve terminals and preterminal processes in the <BrainRegion>caudal part of the nucleus of the tractus solitarius</BrainRegion> (nTS) was examined by the indirect immunofluorescence method for immunocytochemistry combined with cytoarchitectural identification of nuclear subgroups in the same tissue. In 22 Sprague-Dawley rats we examined 14-micrometers-thick serial sections of the <BrainRegion>dorsal medulla</BrainRegion> at levels from 1 mm caudal to 2 mm rostral to the obex. These sections were incubated with substance P, enkephalin, somatostatin, and neurophysin II antisera. All four peptides were examined in each case and five typical levels (two caudal and three rostral to the obex) were selected for comparison of terminal distribution between peptides. All sections were photographed under the fluorescence microscope and then counter-stained with cresyl violet. This method of analysis revealed distinct patterns of neuropeptide immunoreactivity in the <BrainRegion>subnuclei of the nucleus of the tractus solitarius</BrainRegion>(nTS) that varied according to the level of the section. The <BrainRegion>nucleus of the tractus solitarius</BrainRegion>(nTS) is responsible for integrating respiratory, cardiovascular (baroreceptor and cardiac), and gastrointestinal functions. The <BrainRegion>ventrolateral subnucleus (Vl) nucleus of the tractus solitarius</BrainRegion>(nTS) , <BrainRegion>ventral subnucleus (v) nucleus of the tractus solitarius</BrainRegion>(nTS) , <BrainRegion>interstitial subnucleus (ni) nucleus of the tractus solitarius</BrainRegion>(nTS) , and <BrainRegion>intermediate subnucleus (nI) nucleus of the tractus solitarius</BrainRegion>(nTS) are the major respiratory subnuclei with <BrainRegion>vl nucleus of the tractus solitarius</BrainRegion>(nTS) and <BrainRegion>v nucleus of the tractus solitarius</BrainRegion>(nTS) prominently associated with pulmonary afferents, <BrainRegion>ni</BrainRegion> associated with laryngeal afferents, and <BrainRegion>nI</BrainRegion> with tracheal afferents. The <BrainRegion>vl nucleus of the tractus solitarius</BrainRegion>(nTS) , <BrainRegion>v nucleus of the tractus solitarius</BrainRegion>(nTS) , and <BrainRegion>ni</BrainRegion> showed a moderate density of somatostatin-positive nerve terminals, scattered substance P and enkephalin immunoreactivity, and no neurophysin II-positive terminals. The <BrainRegion>nI</BrainRegion> showed moderate density of substance P immunoreactive nerve terminals. The <BrainRegion>subnuclei of the nucleus of the tractus solitarius</BrainRegion>(nTS) receiving baroreceptor and chemoreceptor afferents--<BrainRegion>dorsolateral and dorsal (dl and d) subnuclei of nucleus of the tractus solitarius</BrainRegion>(nTS) --showed scattered substance P immunoreactive nerve terminals. The <BrainRegion>commissural nucleus of nucleus of the tractus solitarius</BrainRegion>(nTS) (ncom), which receives most of the cardiac afferents, showed a moderate density of enkephalin-positive immunoreactive nerve terminals. The <BrainRegion>medial subnucleus (m) nucleus of the tractus solitarius</BrainRegion>(nTS) at levels rostral to the obex, the primary site for the termination of gastrointestinal afferents, showed substance P immunoreactivity in moderate amounts and weak immunoreactivity for all the other neuropeptides. An important result of these experiments was the observation that regions of the <BrainRegion>medulla</BrainRegion> adjacent to the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the tractus solitarius</BrainRegion>(nTS) , i.e., the <BrainRegion>ventral parasolitarius region</BrainRegion> (vPSR), <BrainRegion>dorsal (d)PSR</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>periventricular region</BrainRegion> (PVR) showed the densest amounts of immunoreactive nerve terminals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Classification of the principal cells of the <BrainRegion>medial nucleus of the trapezoid body</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Cells in the <BrainRegion>medial nucleus of the trapezoid body</BrainRegion> were intracellularly labeled in <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion> tissue slices of two bat and two rodent species. The main cell type found in this nucleus, the principal cell, is an important link in the relay of ascending projections from the <BrainRegion>contralateral cochlear nucleus</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>lateral superior olive</BrainRegion>, completing an essential pathway for sound localization. Principal cells are often viewed as a highly homogeneous group with a consistent morphology as well as a common function. Intracellular labeling has revealed a number of new axonal and dendritic features of principal cells. Some of these features vary widely from cell to cell, suggesting that the population of principal cells contains several morphologically distinct subgroups. Similar subsets of principal cells were recognized in all species examined. Five subgroups were distinguished on the basis of the position of dendritic fields. Although the dendrites of most labeled cells were confined to the <BrainRegion>medial nucleus of the trapezoid body</BrainRegion>, some principal cells had dendrites that spread outside the nucleus to one of several adjacent <BrainRegion>periolivary</BrainRegion> cell groups. Cells were also found that had dendrites that spread medially across the midline and into the <BrainRegion>contralateral medial nucleus of the trapezoid body</BrainRegion>. Axonal projections were used to distinguish two additional subgroups of principal cells. All principal cells project to the <BrainRegion>lateral superior olive</BrainRegion> and virtually all have one or more secondary projections. There are two subgroups with unusual collateral projections: one with collaterals that extended to the <BrainRegion>lateral lemniscus</BrainRegion> and one with recurrent collateral axons.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Distribution of the voltage-dependent calcium channel alpha(1A) subunit throughout the mature rat brain and its relationship to neurotransmitter pathways.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The alpha(1) subunit provides both the voltage-sensing mechanism and the ion pore of voltage-dependent calcium channels. Of the six classes of alpha(1) subunit cloned to date, alpha)1A) is the subject of debate in terms of its functional correlate, although it is generally thought to encode voltage-dependent calcium channels of the omega-agatoxin IVA-sensitive, P/Q type. In the present study, an alpha(1A)-specific riboprobe and antibody were used with in situ hybridisation and immunohistochemical techniques to localise alpha(1A) messenger ribonucleic acid transcripts and subunit protein throughout the mature rat brain. Dual localisation of alpha(1A) protein and markers for acetylcholine, catecholamines, and 5-hydroxytryptamine have also been performed in a number of discrete areas. Abundant and widespread distribution of alpha(1A) protein was found, with immunoreactivity occurring both in cell bodies and as punctate staining in areas of neuronal processes. Several associations were noted across alpha(1A) localisation, defined neuroanatomical regions, and neurotransmitter systems. However, alpha(1A) expression was not confined to loci corresponding to any one neurotransmitter type, although a high level of expression was observed in cholinergic neurones. The distribution of the alpha(1A) subunit in the rat corresponded well with the limited human mapping data that are available.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Ultrastructural evidence for a direct excitatory pathway from the <BrainRegion>nucleus retroambiguus</BrainRegion> to lateral longissimus and quadratus lumborum motoneurons in the female golden hamster.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>During mating, the female golden hamster displays a stereotyped specific receptive posture, characterized by lordosis of the back, elevation of the tail, and extension of the legs. Muscles involved in this posture are thought to be iliopsoas, cutaneus trunci, lateral longissimus (LL), and quadratus lumborum (QL). Lesion studies in rats suggest that mating behavior is controlled by the <BrainRegion>mesencephalic periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion> (PAG). The <BrainRegion>periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion>(PAG) does not project directly to the motoneurons innervating the muscles involved in mating, but is thought to make use of the <BrainRegion>nucleus retroambiguus</BrainRegion> (NRA) as relay. The <BrainRegion>nucleus retroambiguus</BrainRegion>(NRA) is located ventrolaterally in the most <BrainRegion>caudal medulla</BrainRegion>, and projects directly to iliopsoas and cutaneus trunci motoneuronal cell groups. The question is whether this is also true for lateral longissimus(LL) and quadratus lumborum(QL) muscles. Retrograde HRP tracing experiments revealed that lateral longissimus(LL) and quadratus lumborum(QL) motoneurons are located medially in the <BrainRegion>ventral horn</BrainRegion> of the T12-L6 and T13-L4 segments, respectively. A subsequent ultrastructural study combined wheatgerm agglutinin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase injections in the <BrainRegion>nucleus retroambiguus</BrainRegion>(NRA) with cholera-toxin B-subunit injections in lateral longissimus(LL) and quadratus lumborum(QL) muscles. The results revealed monosynaptic contacts between anterogradely labeled <BrainRegion>nucleus retroambiguus</BrainRegion>(NRA) -fiber terminals with retrogradely labeled dendrites of both lateral longissimus(LL) and quadratus lumborum(QL) motoneurons. Almost all these terminals had asymmetrical synapses and contained spherical vesicles, suggesting an excitatory function of this <BrainRegion>nucleus retroambiguus</BrainRegion>(NRA) -motoneuronal pathway. These results correspond with the hypothesis that in hamster the <BrainRegion>periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion>(PAG) - <BrainRegion>nucleus retroambiguus</BrainRegion>(NRA) -motoneuronal projection not only involves motoneurons of iliopsoas and cutaneus trunci but also of lateral longissimus(LL) and quadratus lumborum(QL) .</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>The morphological diversity and receptive fields of spiking local interneurons in the locust metathoracic ganglion.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Twenty-one types of spiking local interneurons are described in a segmental ganglion of the locust. All have their cell bodies in a group at the ventral midline of the metathoracic ganglion. The interneurons are characterized by their shape as revealed by intracellular injection of dye, and by their physiology as revealed by intracellular recording. Each interneuron conforms to a basic plan, but the characteristic shape of each is derived from the elaboration of branches in some regions of the neuropil and by their absence in other regions. Some interneurons have ventral branches that extend over most of one-half of the metathoracic neuropil, whilst others have ventral branches restricted to a small region of neuropil. A few interneurons have dorsal branches that enter the first abdominal neuromere . Each type of interneuron is excited by a specific array of mechanoreceptors on the hind leg ipsilateral to its neuropilar branches. Some interneurons have a wide receptive field that encompasses most of the dorsal surfaces of the distal three parts of a leg, whilst others have a field limited to the spurs at the distal end of the tibia. The relationship between the shape of an interneuron and the size or orientation of its receptive field is discussed.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Characterization of trout galanin and its distribution in trout brain and <BrainRegion>pituitary</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Galanin was purified from an extract of the stomach of the rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, and its primary structure was established as Gly-Trp-Thr-Leu-Asn-Ser- Ala-Gly-Tyr-Leu10-Leu-Gly-Pro-His-Gly-Ile-Asp-Gly-His-Arg20- Thr-Leu-Ser-Asp- Lys-His-Gly-Leu-Ala. Trout galanin shows six amino acid substitutions compared with pig galanin, but the N-terminal region (residues 1-14) has been fully conserved. The distribution of galanin-immunoreactive (GAL-IR) structures in the trout brain and <BrainRegion>pituitary</BrainRegion> was studied via immunohistochemistry. galanin-immunoreactive(GAL-IR) cell bodies were observed only in the <BrainRegion>caudal telencephalon</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>preoptic region</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>mediobasal hypothalamus</BrainRegion>. galanin-immunoreactive(GAL-IR) fibers, however, are widely distributed throughout the brain, with a much lower density in the <BrainRegion>midbrain</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>posterior brain</BrainRegion> than in the <BrainRegion>tel- and diencephalon</BrainRegion>. Particularly dense innervation of the <BrainRegion>mediobasal hypothalamus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>ventral and supracommissuralis parts of the caudal telencephalon</BrainRegion>, and the region above and below the <BrainRegion>anterior commissure</BrainRegion> was observed. A heavy innervation of the <BrainRegion>pituitary</BrainRegion> was consistently detected. galanin-immunoreactive(GAL-IR) fibers were present in neurohypophyseal digitations of both the <BrainRegion>anterior and intermediate lobes</BrainRegion> with highest density in the region of the <BrainRegion>proximal pars distalis</BrainRegion>, where growth hormone and gonadotropic cells are located. Fibers were also seen in digitations of the <BrainRegion>rostral pars distalis</BrainRegion>, in particular between the prolactin follicles. The distribution of galanin-immunoreactive(GAL-IR) neurons in the central nervous system and <BrainRegion>pituitary</BrainRegion> of the trout suggests that the peptide may exercise an important role in the regulation of neuroendocrine functions, particularly those related to reproduction.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Neonatal <BrainRegion>infraorbital nerve</BrainRegion> transection in rat results in peripheral trigeminal sprouting.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Retrograde tracing techniques were employed to determine whether transection of the <BrainRegion>infraorbital (IO) nerve</BrainRegion> in either newborn or adult rats resulted in peripheral sprouting by undamaged trigeminal (V) axons. The <BrainRegion>infraorbital(IO) nerve</BrainRegion> was sectioned just behind the vibrissa pad, either on the day of birth or when animals reached at least 60 days of age. After an additional 60 days, the same nerve was retransected in the orbit; horseradish peroxidase (HRP) or diamidino yellow (DY) was injected into the central portion of the vibrissa pad; and animals were killed 2-3 days later. In the neonatally nerve-damaged rats, this procedure invariably labelled primary afferent neurons in both the ipsilateral and contralateral V ganglia. On the ipsilateral side, these cells were located in the <BrainRegion>caudal portion of the ophthalmic-maxillary region</BrainRegion> and, less often, in the <BrainRegion>mandibular division</BrainRegion>. Their average diameter was 22.6 micron (s.d. = 5.6). On the contralateral side, most labelled ganglion cells were visible in the <BrainRegion>anteromedial part of the ophthalmic-maxillary region</BrainRegion> but a few could also be seen in the <BrainRegion>mandibular division</BrainRegion>. Their average diameter was 21.1 micron (s.d. = 5.5). No labelled ganglion cells were observed in adult rats subjected to the same series of manipulations. In a separate series of neonatally nerve-damaged animals, the above-described procedures were combined with neonatal injection of capsaicin in an effort to determine whether the observed sprouting was dependent upon the presence of large numbers of unmyelinated axons. The addition of this treatment reduced the number of labelled cells in both the ipsilateral and contralateral ganglia, but it did not alter either their distribution or average soma diameter. In a final experiment, sequential double-labelling techniques were used to determine whether the V axons that projected to the vibrissa pad via non- <BrainRegion>infraorbital(IO) nerve</BrainRegion> branches were the result of sprouting by undamaged ganglion cells or arose from neurons that had originally projected into the <BrainRegion>infraorbital(IO) nerve</BrainRegion>, were axotomized by our lesions, and regenerated to the vibrissa pad via another V branch. Here, the long-lived retrograde tracer true blue (TB) was injected into the vibrissa pad 6-8 hours before the neonatal nerve cut and diamidino yellow(DY) was deposited into the pad after transection of the regenerate <BrainRegion>infraorbital(IO) nerve</BrainRegion> in adulthood. Double-labelled cells in this experiment would have projected to the vibrissa pad via the <BrainRegion>infraorbital(IO) nerve</BrainRegion> at birth and regenerated to it via another V branch in adulthood. Nearly 55% of the diamidino yellow(DY) -labelled cells in this experiment also contained true blue(TB) .(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Neuroanatomical effects of neonatal transection of the <BrainRegion>corpus callosum</BrainRegion> in hamsters.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Newborn hamsters were subjected to surgical transection of their <BrainRegion>corpora callosa</BrainRegion> under hypothermic anesthesia. After completion of their development, one group of animals had their brains prepared for cyto- and myeloarchitectonic analysis. Another group had a small pellet of polyacrylamide gel containing horseradish peroxidase (HRP) implanted in different <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> loci. All were perfused with fixatives and had their brains cut into serial sections. The operated brains showed the following anatomical features: (1) The <BrainRegion>corpus callosum</BrainRegion> was partially or totally absent; (2) an abnormal longitudinal bundle was present bilaterally underneath the white matter; and (3) except for the physical displacement of some medial structures, the general architecture of the brain appeared unchanged. Analysis of horseradish peroxidase(HRP) material revealed that (1) the longitudinal bundle contains <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> fibers, of which at least some are <BrainRegion>commissural</BrainRegion>; (2) these <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> fibers display a topographic arrangement within the bundle. Results suggest that brain anatomy of &quot;surgical" acallosal hamsters compares closely with that observed in mice with congenital defects of the corpus callosum, a spontaneous condition which also occurs in humans.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>The olivocerebellar projection in the cat studied with the method of retrograde axonal transport of horseradish peroxidase. VI. The projection onto <BrainRegion>longitudinal zones of the paramedian lobule</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Microinjections (30-50 nl) of a horseradish peroxidase (HRP) suspension of 25% (wt./vol.) were made in different folia of the <BrainRegion>paramedian lobule</BrainRegion> of cats, and the sites of occurrence of labeled cells in the <BrainRegion>inferior olive</BrainRegion> were precisely determined. In each case only a small number of cells are labeled, aggregated in a minute area. The labeled cells are found within three only of the four <BrainRegion>olivary areas</BrainRegion> previously determined (Brodal et al., &apos;75) to project onto the <BrainRegion>paramedian lobule</BrainRegion> (fig. 1): one area in the <BrainRegion>rostral half of the medial accessory olive</BrainRegion>, another in the <BrainRegion>dorsal accessory olive</BrainRegion> (except its caudalmost part), and a third in part of the caudal half of the dorsal lamella of the <BrainRegion>principal olive</BrainRegion>. Labeled cells were never found in the fourth area, the ventral lamella. A distinct zonal pattern in the projection is demonstrated (figs. 3, 5B): a <BrainRegion>middle longitudinal zone of the paramedian lobule</BrainRegion> receives <BrainRegion>olivary</BrainRegion> afferents from the area in the <BrainRegion>medial accessory olive</BrainRegion>, a medial zone from part of the projection area in the <BrainRegion>dorsal accessory olive</BrainRegion>, a lateral zone from part of the projection area in the dorsal lamella. This zonal projection appears to extend throughout the length of the <BrainRegion>paramedian lobule</BrainRegion> (the two caudalmost folia could not be studied). tthe somatotopical pattern in the projections from the <BrainRegion>accessory olives</BrainRegion> described previously (Brodal et al., &apos;75) is confirmed. The pattern of a zonal projection obtained with the horseradish peroxidase(HRP) -method (fig 5B) is simpler than that deduced by Armstrong et al ('74) from recordings of antidromic potentials in the <BrainRegion>olive</BrainRegion> (fig 5A).

The phenomenon that following microinjections of horseradish peroxidase(HRP) in superficial parts of the folia labeled cells occur within parts only of the regions of the <BrainRegion>olive</BrainRegion> which contain labeled cells following large horseradish peroxidase(HRP) -injections in the <BrainRegion>paramedian lobule</BrainRegion> is discussed.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Calretinin-like immunoreactivity in mormyrid and gymnarchid electrosensory and electromotor systems.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Calretinin-like immunoreactivity was examined in the electrosensory and electromotor systems of the two families of mormyriform electric fish. Mormyrid fish showed the strongest immunoreactivity in the knollenorgan electroreceptor pathway; in the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the electrosensory lateral line lobe</BrainRegion> (ELL) and the big cells of the <BrainRegion>nucleus exterolateralis pars anterior</BrainRegion>. Mormyromast and ampullary zones of the <BrainRegion>electrosensory lateral line lobe</BrainRegion>(ELL) showed calretinin-like immunoreactivity in the ganglion, granule, and intermediate cell and fiber layers. Mormyromast zones additionally showed labeling of apical dendrites and <BrainRegion>commissural</BrainRegion> cells, but the ampullary zone did not. In the electromotor system, two nuclei in the corollary discharge pathway showed labeling: in the <BrainRegion>paratrigeminal command-associated nucleus</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>juxtalobar nucleus</BrainRegion>. Gymnarchus niloticus (Gymnarchidae) showed strongest calretinin-like immunoreactivity in part of the phase-coding pathway; in S-type electroreceptor afferents. Zones of the <BrainRegion>electrosensory lateral line lobe</BrainRegion>(ELL) not receiving phase-coder input had weak labeling. The electromotor system showed labeling in the <BrainRegion>lateral relay nucleus</BrainRegion> and less strongly in the <BrainRegion>medullary relay nucleus</BrainRegion>, but none in the pacemaker. The concentration of calcium-binding proteins in mormyrid and gymnarchid time-coding electrosensory pathways is consistent with the hypothesis that they play a role in preserving temporal information across synapses. Cell types that encode temporal characteristics of stimuli in precise spike times have high levels of calcium-binding proteins, but cells that re-code temporal information into presence or magnitude of activity have low levels. Some cell types in the electromotor pathways and early in the time-coding electrosensory pathways do not follow this hypothesis, and therefore preserve temporal information using a mechanism independent of calcium-binding proteins. In particular, electromotor systems may use extensive electrotonic coupling within nuclei to ensure precise timing.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Cell death of motoneurons in the chick embryo <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>. VI. Reduction of naturally occurring cell death in the thoracolumbar column of Terni by nerve growth factor.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>A discrete preganglionic cell column (<BrainRegion>column of Terni</BrainRegion>, CT) in the <BrainRegion>caudal thoracolumbar (segments 21-23) spinal cord</BrainRegion> is first discernible in a avian embryos on day 8 when it contains approximately 9,300 visceral motoneurons. By day 10 there are about 6,900 motoneurons in the <BrainRegion>thoracolumbar (sympathetic) CT</BrainRegion> and this number remains constant until at least day 15. Daily injections of nerve growth factor (NGF) (1-20 micrograms) on the chorioallantoic membrane from day 3 to day 9 produced a dose-dependent increase in both the volume of the <BrainRegion>caudal thoracolumbar</BrainRegion> sympathetic ganglia and the number of motoneurons in the corresponding <BrainRegion>CT</BrainRegion> on day 10. The number and size of the neurons in the paravertebral sympathetic ganglia was also increased by nerve growth factor(NGF) . Nerve growth factor decreased the number of pyknotic (dying) neurons in both the <BrainRegion>thoracolumbar</BrainRegion> sympathetic ganglia and the corresponding <BrainRegion>CT</BrainRegion> on days 8 and 10. The increased number of neurons in both the <BrainRegion>thoracolumbar</BrainRegion> sympathetic ganglia and the corresponding <BrainRegion>CT</BrainRegion> following chronic administration of nerve growth factor(NGF) is the result of decreased cell death. The highest dose of nerve growth factor(NGF) reduced naturally occurring cell death in the <BrainRegion>thoracolumbar CT</BrainRegion> by more than 60%. Daily injections of cytochrome C (20 micrograms) from day 3 to day 9 had no effect on either the volume of the sympathetic ganglia or the number of motoneurons in the <BrainRegion>Ct</BrainRegion> on day 10. Daily injections of nerve growth factor(NGF) (10-20 micrograms) from day 10 until day 14 increased the volume of (and the number of neurons in) the <BrainRegion>caudal thoracic</BrainRegion> sympathetic ganglia on day 15 but no effect on the number of motoneurons in the corresponding <BrainRegion>CT</BrainRegion>. Nerve growth factor also had no effect on the number of motoneurons in either the somatic lateral motor column, the sacral (parasympathetic) <BrainRegion>CT</BrainRegion>, or the &quot;abortive" visceral efferent column at the cervical level. Daily administration of nerve growth factor(NGF) produced a similar increase in the volume of the dorsal root ganglia at the cervical, thoracic, and sacral levels. The reduction of cell death in the <BrainRegion>thoracolumbar CT</BrainRegion> by nerve growth factor(NGF) is the result of neither a direct effect on spinal motoneurons nor an indirect effect of increased sensory innervation. Naturally occurring cell death of sympathetic preganglionic neurons is regulated by the size of their innervation field.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Gamma-aminobutyric acid is present in a spatially discrete subpopulation of hair cells in the <BrainRegion>crista ampullaris</BrainRegion> of the toadfish Opsanus tau.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Although gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate are known to be present in the vestibular sensory epithelia of a variety of species, the functional relationship between these two transmitters is not clear. The present study addresses the three-dimensional spatial distribution of gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) and glutamate immunoreactivity in the <BrainRegion>vestibular labyrinth</BrainRegion> of the oyster toadfish by using whole end organs labeled by immunofluorescence with monoclonal anti- gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) and/or antiglutamate antibodies and visualized as whole mounts by multiphoton confocal microscopy. We find glutamate-immunoreactive hair cells present throughout the sensory epithelium. In contrast, prominent gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) immunoreactivity is restricted to a small population of hair cells located in the central region of the crista. Double immunofluorescence reveals two distinct staining patterns in gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) -labeled hair cells. Most ( approximately 80%) gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) -labeled cells show trace levels of glutamate, appropriate for the metabolic/synthetic role of cytoplasmic glutamate. The remainder of the gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) -stained cells contain substantial levels of both gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) and glutamate, suggesting transmitter colocalization. In the toadfish <BrainRegion>utricle</BrainRegion>, glutamatergic hair cells are present throughout the <BrainRegion>macula</BrainRegion>. gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) -immunoreactive hair cells follow the arc of the striola, and most gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) -labeled receptor cells coexpress glutamate. The localization of gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) was explored in other species as well. In the pigeon, gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) ergic hair cells are present throughout the <BrainRegion>crista ampullaris</BrainRegion>. Our findings demonstrate that multiple, neurochemically distinct types of hair cells are present in vestibular sensory epithelia. These observations, together with the excitatory activity generally associated with <BrainRegion>8th nerve</BrainRegion> afferent fibers, strongly suggest that gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) serves an important, specific, and complex role in determining primary afferent response dynamics.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Morphological and electrophysiological identification of <BrainRegion>gigantocellular tegmental field</BrainRegion> neurons with descending projections in the cat: II. Bulb.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>There are three different descending projections from the <BrainRegion>bulbar gigantocellular tegmental field</BrainRegion> (BFTG) in the cat, as defined by intracellular recording and intracellular horseradish peroxidase (HRP) techniques. The first pathway arises from neurons which send axons to the contralateral medial longitudinal fasciculus (cMLF neurons); <BrainRegion>cMLF</BrainRegion> neurons show excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) after stimulation of the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral pontine gigantocellular tegmental field</BrainRegion> (PFTG). Most <BrainRegion>cMLF</BrainRegion> neurons have large ellipsoid-polygonal somata (mean, 56.8 micron), thick axons (average diameter, 3.09 microns), mostly non-spiny dendrites and dendritic fields flattened in the anteroposterior direction. No <BrainRegion>cMLF</BrainRegion> neurons with axon collaterals in the <BrainRegion>BFTG</BrainRegion> are present in the data of this study. The second pathway arises from neurons which send axons to the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral MLF</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>iMLF</BrainRegion> neurons); <BrainRegion>iMLF</BrainRegion> neurons show excitatory postsynaptic potentials(EPSPs) after stimulation of the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral PFTG</BrainRegion>. Most <BrainRegion>iMLF</BrainRegion> neurons have large ellipsoid-polygonal somata ( Most <BrainRegion>iBRF</BrainRegion> neurons have smaller ellipsoid-polygonal somata(mean) , 60.2 microns), thick axons (average diameter, 3.00 microns), mostly non-spiny dendrites and dendritic fields that are only slightly flattened in the anteroposterior direction. As with <BrainRegion>cMLF</BrainRegion> neurons, no <BrainRegion>iMLF</BrainRegion> neurons with axon collaterals in the <BrainRegion>BFTG</BrainRegion> are present in the data of this study. The third pathway arises from neurons that send axons directly into the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral caudal bulbar reticular formation</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>iBRF</BrainRegion> neurons). Most <BrainRegion>iBRF</BrainRegion> neurons have smaller ellipsoid-polygonal somata ( Most <BrainRegion>iBRF</BrainRegion> neurons have smaller ellipsoid-polygonal somata(mean) , 38.6 microns), thinner axons (average diameter, 1.84 microns), mostly nonspiny dendrites, and dendritic fields that are flattened in the anteroposterior direction. In contrast to <BrainRegion>cMLF</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>iMLF</BrainRegion> neurons, axon collaterals are present in 73% of <BrainRegion>iBRF</BrainRegion> neurons. About half of <BrainRegion>iBRF</BrainRegion> neurons have bifurcated axon collaterals with both anterior and posterior projections, and in these neurons antidromic spike potentials are elicited by stimulation of the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral PFTG</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Differentiation and morphogenesis in pellet cultures of developing rat <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> cells.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>We previously developed a reaggregate cell culture system (pellet cultures) in which <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> neuroepithelial cells proliferate and give rise to rod photoreceptor cells (rods) in vitro (Watanabe and Raff, 1990, Neuron 4:461-467). In the present study, we analyzed cell differentiation and morphogenesis in pellet cultures by using both cell-type-specific markers with immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. We demonstrated that, in addition to rod photoreceptor cells(rods) , the other major <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> cell types, including amacrine cells, bipolar cells, Müller cells, and ganglion cells were all present in the pellets, where most were able to develop from dividing precursor cells in vitro. The different cell types in the pellets became organized into two distinct structures: dark rosettes and pale rosettes. The cellular composition of these structures indicated that the dark rosettes correspond to the outer nuclear layer and the pale rosettes to the inner nuclear layer of the normal <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>. Ultrastructural studies have indicated that the thin layer of neuronal processes surrounding the dark rosettes correspond to the outer plexiform layer, and the central region of the pale rosettes correspond to the inner plexiform layer of the normal <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>. Other features of normal <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> development also occurred in the pellets, including programmed cell death and the formation of inner and outer rod cell segments and synapses. Thus, pellet cultures provide a convenient way to study different aspects of <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> development where one can control the size and the cellular composition of the initial reaggregate.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Connexin26 in adult rodent central nervous system: demonstration at astrocytic gap junctions and colocalization with connexin30 and connexin43.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The connexin family of proteins (Cx) that form intercellular gap junctions in vertebrates is well represented in the mammalian central nervous system. Among these, connexin family of proteins(Cx) 30 and connexin family of proteins(Cx) 43 are present in gap junctions of astrocytes. connexin family of proteins(Cx) 32 is expressed by oligodendrocytes and is present in heterologous gap junctions between oligodendrocytes and astrocytes as well as at autologous gap junctions between successive myelin layers. connexin family of proteins(Cx) 36 mRNA has been identified in neurons, and connexin family of proteins(Cx) 36 protein has been localized at ultrastructurally defined interneuronal gap junctions. connexin family of proteins(Cx) 26 is also expressed in the CNS, primarily in the <BrainRegion>leptomeningeal linings</BrainRegion>, but is also reported in astrocytes and in neurons of developing brain and <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>. To establish further the regional, cellular, and subcellular localization of connexin family of proteins(Cx) 26 in neural tissue, we investigated this connexin in adult mouse brain and in rat brain and <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> using biochemical and immunocytochemical methods. Northern blotting, western blotting, and immunofluorescence studies indicated widespread and heterogeneous connexin family of proteins(Cx) 26 expression in numerous <BrainRegion>subcortical areas</BrainRegion> of both species. By confocal microscopy, connexin family of proteins(Cx) 26 was colocalized with both connexin family of proteins(Cx) 30 and connexin family of proteins(Cx) 43 in leptomeninges as well as along blood vessels in <BrainRegion>cortical and subcortical structures</BrainRegion>. It was also localized at the surface of oligodendrocyte cell bodies, where it was coassociated with connexin family of proteins(Cx) 32. Freeze-fracture replica immunogold labeling (FRIL) demonstrated connexin family of proteins(Cx) 26 in most gap junctions between cells of the pia mater by postnatal day 4. By postnatal day 18 and thereafter, connexin family of proteins(Cx) 26 was present at gap junctions between astrocytes and in the astrocyte side of most gap junctions between astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. In perinatal <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> and in five regions of adult brain and <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> examined by Freeze-fracture replica immunogold labeling(FRIL) , no evidence was obtained for the presence of connexin family of proteins(Cx) 26 in neuronal gap junctions. In addition to its established localization in leptomeningeal gap junctions, these results identify connexin family of proteins(Cx) 26 as a third connexin (together with connexin family of proteins(Cx) 30 and connexin family of proteins(Cx) 43) within astrocytic gap junctions and suggest a further level of complexity to the heterotypic connexin channel combinations formed at these junctions.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Central projections of the <BrainRegion>lateral line nerves</BrainRegion> in the shovelnose sturgeon.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Primary projections of the <BrainRegion>anterior ( ALLN ) and posterior ( PLLN ) lateral line nerves</BrainRegion> were traced in the shovelnose sturgeon by means of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) histochemistry and silver degeneration. The trunk of the <BrainRegion>ALLN</BrainRegion> divides into dorsal and ventral roots as it enters the <BrainRegion>medulla</BrainRegion>. Fibers of the <BrainRegion>dorsal root</BrainRegion> form ascending and descending branches that terminate within the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral dorsal octavolateralis nucleus</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>dorsal granular component of the lateral eminentia granularis</BrainRegion>. Fibers of the <BrainRegion>ventral root of the ALLN</BrainRegion> , as well as fibers of the <BrainRegion>PLLN</BrainRegion> , enter the <BrainRegion>medulla</BrainRegion> ventral to the <BrainRegion>dorsal root of the ALLN</BrainRegion> where some of the fibers terminate among the dendrites of the <BrainRegion>magnocellular octaval nucleus</BrainRegion>. The bulk of the fibers form ascending and descending branches that terminate within the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral medial octavolateralis nucleus</BrainRegion>. A portion of the ascending fibers continue more rostrally and terminate in the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral eminentia granularis</BrainRegion> and bilaterally in the <BrainRegion>cerebellar corpus</BrainRegion>. Some fibers of the descending rami of both the <BrainRegion>ALLN</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>PLLN</BrainRegion> extend beyond the caudal limit of the <BrainRegion>medial octavolateralis nucleus</BrainRegion> to terminate in the <BrainRegion>caudal octavolateralis nucleus</BrainRegion>. The horseradish peroxidase(HRP) cases also revealed retrogradely filled large neurons whose axons course peripherally in the <BrainRegion>lateral line nerve</BrainRegion> and are likely efferent to the lateral line organs.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Interrelationship of the distribution of neuropeptides and tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity in the human <BrainRegion>substantia Nigra</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The relationship in the human <BrainRegion>substantia nigra</BrainRegion> of peptidergic fibers with intrinsic dopaminergic neurons was studied in adjacent <BrainRegion>coronal</BrainRegion> sections of the <BrainRegion>mesencephalon</BrainRegion> immunohistochemically stained for enkephalin (ENK), substance P (SP), and tyrosine (TH) hydroxylase immunoreactivity. TH-positive elements are present in the <BrainRegion>substantia nigra</BrainRegion> in at least two different arrangements: 1) a dorsal tier of rather loosely arranged neurons, which is continuous medially with the <BrainRegion>ventral tegmental area</BrainRegion> and laterally with the <BrainRegion>retrorubral area</BrainRegion>, 2) a ventral tier of more closely packed neurons, clusters of which frequently form finger-like extensions deep into the <BrainRegion>pars reticulata</BrainRegion>. This ventral region contains TH-positive dendrites extending ventrally into the <BrainRegion>pars reticulata</BrainRegion>. The distribution of enkephalin(ENK) is mainly restricted to the medial half of the ventral aspect of the <BrainRegion>substantia nigra</BrainRegion>, while substance P(SP) occupies its entire rostral-caudal and medial-lateral extents. Peptide-positive fibers vary in density from dense to light. There is very little overlap between the dorsal tier of the TH-positive neurons and the enkephalin(ENK) or substance P(SP) staining. The dorsal part of the peptide-immunoreactive area extensively overlaps with the TH-positive neurons of the ventral tier of cells. The ventral part of the peptide-positive area overlaps with the <BrainRegion>pars reticulata</BrainRegion> of the <BrainRegion>substantia nigra</BrainRegion> in which the TH-positive dendrites extend. The overlap between the neuropeptide fibers and the TH-positive cells of the ventral tier is not complete, with cells found both within and outside peptide-positive fiber networks. Three patterns of overlap emerge. In dorsal regions elongated cell clusters lie partially within and partially outside the dense peptide-positive fiber networks. In the ventral regions TH-positive cells are either completely embedded within peptide fibers or clusters of cells are present in peptide-free zones. These data suggest that specific peptidergic pathways differentially innervate the <BrainRegion>substantia nigra</BrainRegion>. TH cells which lie within or outside these fibers may reflect functionally different subsystems in the striatonigral pathways in the human.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Distribution of zincergic neurons in the mouse <BrainRegion>forebrain</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Synaptically released zinc is thought to play an important role in neuronal signaling by modulating excitatory and inhibitory receptors and intracellular signaling proteins. Consequently, neurons that release zinc have been implicated in synaptic plasticity underlying learning and memory as well as neuropathological processes such as epilepsy, stroke, and Alzheimer&apos;s disease. To characterize the distribution of these neurons, investigators have relied on a technique that involves the retrograde transport of zinc-selenium crystals from axonal boutons to the cell bodies of origin. However, one major problem with this method is that labeling of cell bodies is obscured by high levels of staining in synaptic boutons, particularly within <BrainRegion>forebrain structures</BrainRegion> where this staining is most intense. Here, we used a modification of the retrograde labeling method that eliminates terminal staining for zinc, thereby enabling a clear and comprehensive description of these neurons. Zincergic neurons were found in all <BrainRegion>cerebral cortical regions</BrainRegion> and were arranged in a distinct laminar pattern, restricted to layers 2/3, 5, and 6 with no labeling in layer 4. In the <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion>, labeling was present in <BrainRegion>CA1</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>CA3</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>dentate gyrus</BrainRegion> but not in <BrainRegion>CA2</BrainRegion>. Labeled cell bodies were also observed in most <BrainRegion>amygdaloid nuclei</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>anterior olfactory nuclei</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>claustrum</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>tenia tecta</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>endopiriform region</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>lateral ventricle</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>lateral septum</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>zona incerta</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion>. Moreover, retrograde labeling was also noted in the <BrainRegion>dorsomedial and lateral hypothalamus</BrainRegion>, regions that previously were thought to be devoid of neurons with a zincergic phenotype. Collectively these data show that zincergic neurons comprise a large population of neurons in the murine <BrainRegion>forebrain</BrainRegion> and will provide an anatomical framework for understanding the functional importance of these neurons in the mammalian brain.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Adult neurogenesis in a moth brain.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>In both vertebrates and invertebrates, neurogenesis not only occurs during development but also persists throughout adult life. So far, adult neurogenesis has been detected in a few insect orders but not in Lepidoptera. In the moth, Agrotis ipsilon, the sensitivity of <BrainRegion>antennal lobe</BrainRegion> interneurons of males to sex pheromone is age- and juvenile hormone-dependent in accordance with changes in the behavioral response. As a first step to understand this neuronal plasticity, we tested the hypothesis that adult neurogenesis could occur in the moth brain using 5-bromo-2&apos;-deoxyuridine injections on newly born and sexually mature moths. Our results show that persistent neurogenesis occurs in mushroom bodies of adult males and females of A. ipsilon. Two clusters of one to four neuroblasts in each brain hemisphere continue to divide in adult moths and give rise to small clusters of Kenyon cells in the <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion> of the mushroom body calyces. Neurogenesis was observed in both newly born and sexually mature males. There was a clear increase in the number of newly born cells in brains as the time increased after the treatment that was performed soon after emergence. When treatments were performed in mature 3-day-old adults, neurogenesis was still detected in brains dissected 3 hours after treatment but was hardly visible 2 days later. Adult neurogenesis was also detected in the <BrainRegion>optic lobes</BrainRegion> but not in the <BrainRegion>antennal lobes</BrainRegion>. We hypothesize that the newly born neurons could play a role in the central nervous plasticity of <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> processing in the adult moth A. ipsilon.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Ontogeny of somatostatin immunoreactive neurons in the <BrainRegion>medial cerebral cortex</BrainRegion> and other <BrainRegion>cortical areas</BrainRegion> of the lizard Podarcis hispanica.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The ontogeny of somatostatin immunoreactive interneurons in the <BrainRegion>cerebral cortex</BrainRegion> of the lizard Podarcis hispanica has been studied in histological series of embryos, perinatal specimens, and adults. Somatostatin immunoreactive interneurons appear in the early stages of lizard <BrainRegion>cerebral cortex</BrainRegion> ontogeny, their number increases during embryonary development, reaches a peak in early postnatal life, and decreases in adult lizards. The first somatostatin immunoreactive somata in the lizard <BrainRegion>forebrain</BrainRegion> appeared on E36, and they were located in non <BrainRegion>cortical areas</BrainRegion>. Then, on E39 and later, somatostatin immunoreactive neurons were seen in the lizard <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion> in a rostral-to-caudal spatial gradient, which parallels that of the normal histogenesis of the lizard <BrainRegion>cerebral cortex</BrainRegion>. On E39, labelled somata were seen in the <BrainRegion>medial and dorsal cortex</BrainRegion> inner plexiform layers; immunoreactive puncta and dendritic processes were detectable in the inner plexiform layer of the <BrainRegion>medial cortex</BrainRegion>. On E40, labelled neurons were observed in the inner plexiform layer of the <BrainRegion>lateral cortex</BrainRegion>; labelled processes were found in the inner plexiform layers (<BrainRegion>dorsomedial, dorsal, and lateral cortices</BrainRegion>) and the outer plexiform layers (<BrainRegion>medial and dorsomedial cortices</BrainRegion>). At hatching (P0), some somatostatin immunoreactive neurons populated the external plexiform layer of the <BrainRegion>dorsomedial cortex</BrainRegion>. On P28, groups of labelled neurons appeared in the cell layer of <BrainRegion>dorsal and lateral cortices</BrainRegion>, reaching the adult-mature pattern of somatostatin immunoreactivity in the lizard <BrainRegion>cerebral cortex</BrainRegion>, i.e., labelled somata and dendritic processes populating the inner plexiform layers in addition to an axonic labelled plexus in the outermost part of the outer plexiform layers. Immunoreactive somata and processes occupied all the <BrainRegion>cortical areas</BrainRegion>, but they were especially abundant in the <BrainRegion>dorsomedial cortex</BrainRegion>. Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) immunostaining in the same histological series revealed that the number of Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen(PCNA) immunoreactive nuclei in the subjacent proliferative neuroepithelium followed an inverse-complementary evolution to somatostatin, suggesting some temporal relationship between somatostatin immunoreactive cells and neurogenesis in the lizard <BrainRegion>cerebral cortex</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Morphology of physiologically identified slowly adapting lung stretch receptor afferents stained with intra-axonal horseradish peroxidase in the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the tractus solitarius</BrainRegion> of the cat. II. An ultrastructural analysis.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The <BrainRegion>nucleus of the tractus solitarius</BrainRegion> is a site for termination of primary afferents originating from a variety of visceral receptors. The localization of bouton terminals of slowly adapting lung stretch (SAR) afferent fibers originating from the tracheobronchial tree have been described in the companion paper (Kalia and Richter, &apos;85). The most conspicuous finding regarding the location of slowly adapting lung stretch(SAR) terminals is that they are concentrated within specific <BrainRegion>subnuclear groups of the nucleus of the tractus solitarius</BrainRegion> (nTS) and are distributed widely in the rostrocaudal plane of the <BrainRegion>medulla oblongata</BrainRegion>. These light microscopic features have provided us with valuable information with regard to the organization of visceral afferents in the central nervous system. The synaptic profiles formed by the 476 bouton terminals of these HRP-labeled afferents have been described in this paper in serial thin sections. All of the bouton terminals examined under the electron microscope were found to contain round synaptic vesicles. Synaptic boutons (1.0-3.0 microns in diameter) were usually of the en passant variety and made contact with different structures depending upon the subnucleus which was examined. In the <BrainRegion>ventral (v) and the ventrolateral (vl) subnuclei of the nucleus of the tractus solitarius</BrainRegion>(nTS) , asymmetrical (type I) synaptic contacts containing round, clear synaptic vesicles of 35-50 microns in diameter were found and these contacts were made with (1) the soma of cell bodies located in that subnucleus; (2) spiny dendrites in that nucleus; (3) vesicle-containing axon terminals that were presynaptic to the HRP-labeled bouton terminal; and (4) vesicle-containing dendrites in which the HRP profile was presynaptically located. The terminal axon remained myelinated till the last 1 micron before the bouton terminal was formed. There was no distinct, unmyelinated portion of the terminal axon. The synaptic bouton received axon-axonal synapses from unlabeled bouton terminals containing round, clear vesicles. This is the first report of the localization of these afferent fibers as well as of the regional variations in the ultrastructure of boutons of physiologically identified terminals. It appears likely that the lung stretch afferent fibers, by having axon-axonal as well as axon-somatic contact in the <BrainRegion>ventral, ventrolateral, and intermediate subnuclei of the nucleus of the tractus solitarius</BrainRegion>(nTS) , can interact in a variety of different ways in this region. The significance of these features in relation to the precise influence of respiratory afferents on central respiratory mechanisms needs to be evaluated further.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>The <BrainRegion>nucleus corporis pontobulbaris</BrainRegion> of the North American opossum.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The <BrainRegion>nucleus of the pontobulbar body</BrainRegion> (PBu) in the North American opossum is located, for the most part, adjacent to the motor root of the <BrainRegion>trigeminal nerve</BrainRegion>. Material prepared by degeneration and autoradiographic methods shows that the <BrainRegion>pontobulbar body</BrainRegion>(PBu) receives projections from the <BrainRegion>facial motor-sensory cortex</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>red nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>cerebellum</BrainRegion>. The latter fibers probably take origin within the <BrainRegion>fastigial nucleus</BrainRegion>. Each of the afferent connections ends in a restricuted part of the <BrainRegion>pontobulbar body</BrainRegion>(PBu) , but there is considerable overlap. Use of the horseradish peroxidase technique reveals that the <BrainRegion>pontobulbar body</BrainRegion>(PBu) projects to the <BrainRegion>spinal cerebellum</BrainRegion> <BrainRegion>(anterior lobe</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>pyramis and paramedian lobules</BrainRegion>), to <BrainRegion>visual-auditory areas of the vermis</BrainRegion> and to the <BrainRegion>lobus simplex</BrainRegion> as well as to <BrainRegion>crus I and II of the hemispheres</BrainRegion>. Although there is some topography to such projections, it is not sharply defined and many regions of the <BrainRegion>pontobulbar body</BrainRegion>(PBu) contain labelled neurons after injections of horseradish peroxidase into widely separate areas of the <BrainRegion>cerebellar cortex</BrainRegion>. Because of its embryogenesis and position, the <BrainRegion>pontobulbar body</BrainRegion>(PBu) is often considered part of the <BrainRegion>dorsolateral basilar pons</BrainRegion>. It appears from our material, however, that the organization of <BrainRegion>pontobulbar body</BrainRegion>(PBu) afferent and efferent connections is different from that of the adjacent <BrainRegion>basilar pons</BrainRegion>, and arguments for considering the <BrainRegion>pontobulbar body</BrainRegion>(PBu) a separate <BrainRegion>precerebellar nucleus</BrainRegion> are presented.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Organization and efferent connections of transplanted <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic nuclei</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The <BrainRegion>hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion> (SCh) is the principal brain structure involved in the generation of circadian rhythms. In the present study, we have employed immunohistochemical techniques to evaluate the development of the fetal <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion>(SCh) following its transplantation to the brain of adult host animals. Donor <BrainRegion>hypothalami</BrainRegion> were obtained from normal Long-Evans fetuses and transplanted to the <BrainRegion>lateral, third, or fourth ventricle</BrainRegion> of Brattleboro rats. Neuronal aggregations exhibiting the organotypic features of the <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion>(SCh) were present in over 90% of the grafts recovered at each transplantation site. Like the normal endogenous <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion>(SCh) , <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion>(SCh) -like cell groups identified within the transplants contained a prominent population of parvicellular (9-13 micron), neurophysin-containing neurons that were immunopositive for vasopressin (VP) but not oxytocin. These <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion>(SCh) -like cell groups also invariably contained similar small neurons that were immunoreactive for vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP). Typically, vasopressin(VP) and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide(VIP) immunoreactive perikarya were concentrated in contiguous, complementary parts of the grafted <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion>(SCh) , but fibers immunoreactive for either peptide were distributed throughout the extent of the nucleus. Because the brain of the Brattleboro rat is deficient in vasopressin, it was possible to evaluate the projection of the vasopressinergic component of the transplanted <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion>(SCh) to the host brain. Although <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion>(SCh) were identified in grafts recovered from each intraventricular transplantation site, an appreciable input to the host brain could be identified only when the fetal tissue was grafted to the <BrainRegion>third ventricle</BrainRegion>. Here, grafted <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion>(SCh) established efferent connections with <BrainRegion>periventricular diencephalic structures</BrainRegion> which ordinarily receive a projection from the in situ <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion>(SCh) . Specifically, vasopressin(VP) immunoreactive fibers originating from transplanted <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion>(SCh) were identified in the <BrainRegion>medial preoptic area</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>periventricular and dorsomedial hypothalamic nuclei</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>paraventricular nuclei of the thalamus and hypothalamus</BrainRegion>, and in the <BrainRegion>retrochiasmatic area</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>arcuate nucleus</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion> of the host brain. These results demonstrate that the fetal <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion>(SCh) not only survives transplantation but also retains its distinguishing cytological features and the capacity to form an appropriately restricted set of efferent connections with the brain of adult host animals.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Quantitative MRI of the <BrainRegion>temporal lobe</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>amygdala</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion> in normal human development: ages 4-18 years.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The volume of the <BrainRegion>temporal lobe</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>superior temporal gyrus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>amygdala</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion> was quantified from magnetic images of the brains of 99 healthy children and adolescents aged 4-18 years. Variability in volume was high for all structures examined. When adjusted for a 9% larger total cerebral volume in males, there were no significant volume differences between sexes. However, sex-specific maturational changes were noted in the volumes of <BrainRegion>medial temporal structures</BrainRegion>, with the <BrainRegion>left amygdala</BrainRegion> increasing significantly only in males and with the <BrainRegion>right hippocampus</BrainRegion> increasing significantly only in females. Right-greater-than-left laterality effects were found for <BrainRegion>temporal lobe</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>superior temporal gyrus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>amygdala</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>hippocampal</BrainRegion> volumes. These results are consistent with previous preclinical and human studies that have indicated hormonal responsivity of these structures and extend quantitative morphologic findings from the adult literature. In addition to highlighting the need for large samples and sex-matched controls in pediatric neuroimaging studies, the information from this understudied age group may be of use in evaluating developmental hypotheses of neuropsychiatric disorders.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>A Golgi analysis of the primate <BrainRegion>globus pallidus</BrainRegion>. III. Spatial organization of the <BrainRegion>striato-pallidal complex</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>An atlas of transverse sections of the <BrainRegion>globus pallidus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>striatum</BrainRegion> was established in macaque with reference to ventricular coordinates. The three-dimensional geometry of the <BrainRegion>striato-pallidal complex</BrainRegion> was investigated by means of sagittal and horizontal reconstructions. Both a personal case studied with autoradiography and data from literature were used to analyze the distribution of <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> axons into the <BrainRegion>striatum</BrainRegion>. One may distinguish two <BrainRegion>striatal</BrainRegion> territories: one, somatotopically arranged, sensorimotor territory extending over the major part of the <BrainRegion>putamen</BrainRegion>; and the other, an associative territory, comprising the <BrainRegion>caudate nucleus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>antero-medial and postero-inferior parts of the putamen</BrainRegion>. The striato-pallido-nigral bundle was studied using Golgi, Perls, and Fink-Heimer techniques. The bundle is described in four parts: <BrainRegion>prepallidal</BrainRegion> (subdivided into caudato-pallidal and putamino-pallidal subparts), <BrainRegion>transpallidal</BrainRegion>, pallido-nigral, and <BrainRegion>nigral</BrainRegion>. The tracing of the limit between the <BrainRegion>caudate</BrainRegion> (associative) and <BrainRegion>putaminal</BrainRegion> (essentially sensorimotor) territories shows that the two components are of roughly the same size in the <BrainRegion>pallidum</BrainRegion>. The data were compared with geometry and orientation of the dendritic arborizations of large <BrainRegion>pallidal</BrainRegion> neurons analyzed in Yelnik et al. (&apos;84). Each <BrainRegion>pallidal</BrainRegion> dendritic disc is able to receive axons from a wide region of the <BrainRegion>striatum</BrainRegion>. This leads to a convergence on <BrainRegion>pallidal</BrainRegion> neurons of <BrainRegion>striatal</BrainRegion> axons from different <BrainRegion>striatal</BrainRegion> somatotopic strips and from the sensorimotor and associative territories. This is an indication that the <BrainRegion>globus pallidus</BrainRegion> may have an integrative role.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Synaptic organisation of lumbar sympathetic ganglia of guinea pigs: serial section ultrastructural analysis of dye-filled sympathetic final motor neurons.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The authors serially sectioned seven dye-filled neuronal somata and more than 1.6 mm of their dendrites from the lumbar sympathetic ganglia of guinea pigs and examined them ultrastructurally to determine the distribution of preganglionic synaptic inputs to their dendrites and cell bodies. Most of the surface of the neurons was covered with Schwann cells. Apposing boutons were rare, with an average density of one axosomatic bouton per 125 microm2 of somatic membrane and one axodendritic bouton per 25 microm of dendrite. Many dendritic segments that were more than 50 microm long completely lacked any apposing boutons. Although the average density of apposing boutons was low, local densities could be high, so that clusters of up to four adjacent boutons occurred on cell bodies and dendrites alike. The spatial arrangement of the apposing boutons for each of the cells examined here was not significantly different from a random distribution. Consequently, the number of apposing boutons observed for any neuron was simply proportional to the amount of neuronal surface sampled in the serial section run. About 50% of boutons directly apposing the neurons lacked any detectable presynaptic specialisations. When they were present, the presynaptic densities had a mean length of about 220 nm, with no difference between boutons that made axosomatic or axodendritic appositions. By applying these data to complete reconstructions of the dendritic trees of dye-filled sympathetic neurons at the light microscopic level, the authors estimated that few neurons in the lumbar sympathetic chain of guinea pigs would receive more than 200 synapses or apposing boutons and that many of them would receive less than 100 synapses. Up to 50% of these boutons would be predicted to make axosomatic contacts. These new observations provide a strong morphological framework for a better understanding of how sympathetic final motor neurons process their preganglionic synaptic inputs.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Glutamate decarboxylase-immunoreactive terminals of Golgi-impregnated axoaxonic cells and of presumed basket cells in synaptic contact with pyramidal neurons of the cat&apos;s <BrainRegion>visual cortex</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Glutamate decarboxylase (GAD)-immunoreactive varicosities were found around cell bodies of nonimmunoreactive and immunoreactive neurons in the cat&apos;s <BrainRegion>visual cortex</BrainRegion>; they also occurred along apical dendrites and axon initial segments of pyramidal neurons. By examination in the electron microscope of structures first identified in the light microscope, it was established that the Glutamate decarboxylase(GAD) -immunoreactive varicosities were boutons in symmetrical synaptic contact with pyramidal cells in layers II-IV. More than 90% of 142 boutons surrounding the cell bodies of 20 pyramidal neurons were immunoreactive for Glutamate decarboxylase(GAD) . Since such a high proportion of the axosomatic boutons are Glutamate decarboxylase(GAD) -immunoreactive, it is likely that the terminals of basket cells are included in this population and so the basket cell probably uses gamma-aminobutyrate as a transmitter, as suggested by previous authors. Almost all the 68 boutons in symmetrical contact with the axon initial segments of six pyramidal neurons could be shown to be Glutamate decarboxylase(GAD) -immunoreactive, which makes it very likely that the boutons of axoaxonic cells contain Glutamate decarboxylase(GAD) -immunoreactivity. This was established unequivocally for an individual Golgi-impregnated axoaxonic cell by combining Golgi impregnation and immunocytochemistry in the same sections: A Golgi-impregnated axoaxonic cell whose cell body was in layer II gave rise to numerous terminal segments, some of which were examined in the electron microscope after gold-toning. These boutons were in synaptic contact with axon initial segments and not only contained the Golgi precipitate but were also immunoreactive for Glutamate decarboxylase(GAD) . It is concluded that the axoaxonic cell in the <BrainRegion>visual cortex</BrainRegion> uses gamma-aminobutyrate as a transmitter. An individual axoaxonic cell in layer II/III was filled with horseradish peroxidase by intracellular iontophoresis. The very extensive local axonal field was composed of 330 terminal bouton rows in layer II/III and a sparse descending collateral projection to infragranular layers. A computer-assisted reconstruction of the axonal field in three dimensions revealed the following: The main output of the cell is to pyramidal neurons that lie deeper than the soma; the axonal arborization occupies an area of 400 micron in the anteroposterior axis and extends 200 micron along the mediolateral axis; the terminal bouton rows in layer II/III form clusters about 50 micron wide running approximately at right angles to the border between areas 17 and 18, with an intercluster interval of about 100 micron. These findings suggest that the terminals of an individual axoaxonic cell could be contained within one ocular dominance column but that there may be inhomogeneities in the weighting of the axoaxonic input to pyramidal cells in the supragranular layers.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Association of ecto-5&apos;-nucleotidase with specific cell types in the adult and developing rat <BrainRegion>olfactory organ</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>A unique feature of the <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> epithelium is its ability to give rise to new sensory neurons throughout life and also following injury. Cells at the basal side of the epithelium serve as neurogenic progenitor cells. The enzyme ecto-5&apos;-nucleotidase is expressed at the surface of developing nerve cells and is regarded as a marker of neural development. To study the expression pattern of the enzyme, we analyzed its distribution in the adult and developing rat <BrainRegion>olfactory organ</BrainRegion>. Labeling is restricted to specific cell types and varies between the epithelia investigated. At the basal side of the <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> epithelium, activity of 5&apos;-nucleotidase is associated specifically with the dark/horizontal basal cells. Neither the light/globose basal cells, which are the immediate precursors of the sensory receptor cells, nor subsets of potentially immature <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> receptor cells are labeled. On the other hand, microvillar cells dispersed at the lumenal side of the epithelium contain 5&apos;-nucleotidase activity. The enzyme is also present at the inner lining of the <BrainRegion>ducts of Bowman&apos;s glands</BrainRegion> as they traverse the epithelium. Within the respiratory epithelium, activity of 5&apos;-nucleotidase is associated with basal cells as well as with the epithelial surface. During development, 5'-nucleotidase is initially limited to the respiratory epithelium, including its basal cells. Dark/horizontal basal cells of the <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> epithelium, which are positive for 5&apos;-nucleotidase, first appear at the border of the respiratory epithelium, suggesting that they might originate from immigrating basal cells of the respiratory epithelium. Within the <BrainRegion>vomeronasal organ</BrainRegion>, labeling is largely restricted to the receptor-free epithelium. Although the functional role of 5&apos;-nucleotidase in the olfactory system needs to be further defined, the distribution of the enzyme can be used successfully as a marker for defined cell types.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Distribution of neuropeptide Y, substance P, and choline acetyltransferase in the developing visual system of the pigeon and effects of unilateral <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> removal.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The distribution of three neuroactive substances, neuropeptide Y, substance P, and choline acetyltransferase, was studied by immunocytochemical methods in central visual regions of adult, developing, and ablated pigeon brains. In normal adult brains, neuropeptide Y-positive cells and processes were present in the <BrainRegion>nucleus pretectalis</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the basal optic root</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the marginal optic tract</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>visual Wulst</BrainRegion>. Substance P-positive cells and processes were found in the <BrainRegion>optic tectum</BrainRegion> and in the <BrainRegion>visual Wulst</BrainRegion>. Stained fibers and terminal-like processes, but no cells, were also observed in several <BrainRegion>visual thalamic nuclei</BrainRegion>. Choline acetyltransferase-positive cells and processes were located in the <BrainRegion>optic tectum</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>visual Wulst</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>nucleus isthmo opticus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>nucleus isthmi</BrainRegion> and certain <BrainRegion>visual thalamic nuclei</BrainRegion>. Cholinergic fibers and processes, but no cells, were present in the <BrainRegion>nucleus principalis precommissuralis</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>supraoptic decussation</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>nucleus lentiformis mesencephali</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>pars magnocellularis</BrainRegion>. In the course of development, the distribution of immunoreactivity for all three substances was found to vary. These changes often involved either progressive increases or decreases in the density of labeled cells, neuropil and/or terminal-like profiles. Experiments with <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> ablated pigeons clearly demonstrated that changes in the normal pattern of immunoreactivity distribution only occurred if the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> was removed immediately after hatching, i.e., before retinofugal connections have been established. The adult pattern of immunoreactivity for all three substances appears to be reached at about the same time that the anatomical and functional maturation of the pigeon visual system is completed. The present results suggest that this temporal correlation reflects the important role that <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> afferents play in the development of these putative peptidergic and cholinergic systems.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Cellular architecture and topographic organization of the <BrainRegion>inferior colliculus</BrainRegion> of the squirrel monkey.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The <BrainRegion>inferior colliculus</BrainRegion> of the squirrel monkey is made up of a large <BrainRegion>central nucleus</BrainRegion>, bordered by the smaller <BrainRegion>external and pericentral nuclei</BrainRegion>. The majority of cells in the <BrainRegion>central nucleus</BrainRegion> exhibit a pronounced laminar arrangement due to the orientation of their dendrites. In medial sections of the nucleus these laminae lie in a dorsorostral to ventrocaudal direction. More laterally the layers assume a horizontal orientation and at the far lateral edge of the <BrainRegion>central nucleus</BrainRegion> come to lie in a ventrorostral to dorsocaudal orientation. A single tonotopic representation of audible frequencies is present in the <BrainRegion>central nucleus</BrainRegion>. A regular progression of best frequencies from low to high is encountered as a microelectrode advances from dorsocaudal to ventrorostral in the sagittal plane. Penetrations in more medial regions of the <BrainRegion>central nucleus</BrainRegion> encounter neurons whose best frequencies represent a higher range of frequencies than those in the lateral parts. The orientation of the isofrequency laminae determined physiologically appears congruent with the orientation of the dendritic laminae. The relative volume of the <BrainRegion>central nucleus</BrainRegion> devoted to each octave from 250 Hz to 32 kHz was determined. Frequencies up to eight kHz command successively larger amounts of collicular tissue. The octave band from 8 to 16 kHz is represented by the greatest amount of collicular tissue. Disproportionate representation of frequency may be the consequence of innervation density along the basilar membrane.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Variation in form and axonal termination in the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the optic tract</BrainRegion> of the rat: the <BrainRegion>medial terminal nucleus</BrainRegion> input on neurons projecting to the <BrainRegion>inferior olive</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The <BrainRegion>nucleus of the optic tract</BrainRegion> (NOT) and the <BrainRegion>medial terminal nucleus</BrainRegion> (MTN) are two <BrainRegion>primary visual nuclei</BrainRegion> that take part in circuits sustaining the optokinetic reflex. The morphology of rat <BrainRegion>nucleus of the optic tract</BrainRegion>(NOT) cells projecting to the <BrainRegion>inferior olive</BrainRegion> ( <BrainRegion>nucleus of the optic tract</BrainRegion>(NOT) -IO neurons) and their terminal input, specifically terminals originating from the <BrainRegion>medial terminal nucleus</BrainRegion>(MTN) , have been studied in the rat at the light and electron microscopical level. This has been done by means of combined retrograde tracing from the <BrainRegion>inferior olive</BrainRegion> and anterograde tracing from the <BrainRegion>medial terminal nucleus</BrainRegion>(MTN) to the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the optic tract</BrainRegion>(NOT) . The area containing <BrainRegion>medial terminal nucleus</BrainRegion>(MTN) terminal fibers and the area occupied by <BrainRegion>nucleus of the optic tract</BrainRegion>(NOT) -IO neurons has been found to match. This matched distribution provides a more detailed description of the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the optic tract</BrainRegion>(NOT) , with possible functional implications. Identified <BrainRegion>nucleus of the optic tract</BrainRegion>(NOT) -IO neurons demonstrate considerable variability in their dendritic branching pattern and have been found to include all neuronal cell types described for the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the optic tract</BrainRegion>(NOT) . The dendritic branching pattern of <BrainRegion>nucleus of the optic tract</BrainRegion>(NOT) -IO cells could be related to the orientation and distribution of the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the optic tract</BrainRegion>(NOT) &apos;s major afferent fiber systems. <BrainRegion>nucleus of the optic tract</BrainRegion>(NOT) -IO neurons receive a variable <BrainRegion>medial terminal nucleus</BrainRegion>(MTN) and <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> input onto their somata, comparable to other cells in the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the optic tract</BrainRegion>(NOT) . With exception of the superficial part of the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the optic tract</BrainRegion>(NOT) , <BrainRegion>nucleus of the optic tract</BrainRegion>(NOT) -IO neurons with the most <BrainRegion>medial terminal nucleus</BrainRegion>(MTN) terminals were found dorsally in areas containing large numbers of <BrainRegion>medial terminal nucleus</BrainRegion>(MTN) terminals. In conclusion, although <BrainRegion>nucleus of the optic tract</BrainRegion>(NOT) -IO neurons are uniform with respect to their receptive field properties, they vary considerably with respect to the shape of the cell body, dendritic branching pattern, and terminal input. This means that morphological characteristics of <BrainRegion>nucleus of the optic tract</BrainRegion>(NOT) -IO neurons have no predictive value with regard to their receptive field properties.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>In situ hybridization detection of trkA mRNA in brain: distribution, colocalization with p75NGFR and up-regulation by nerve growth factor.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>In situ hybridization techniques were used to examine the distribution and the nerve growth factor (NGF) regulation of trkA mRNA in the adult rat brain in order to identify neurons in discrete regions of the brain that may be nerve growth factor(NGF) responsive. In agreement with previous studies, trkA mRNA was detected within cells located in the <BrainRegion>medial septum</BrainRegion> (MS), <BrainRegion>diagonal band of Broca</BrainRegion> (DBB), and <BrainRegion>caudate</BrainRegion>. trkA mRNA was also detected in many other regions of the brain, including the <BrainRegion>nucleus basalis of Meynert</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>substantia innominata</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>interpeduncular nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>prepositus hypoglossal nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>vestibular nuclei</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>raphe obscuris</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>cochlear nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>sensory trigeminal nuclei</BrainRegion>, and gigantocellular as well as perigigantocellular neurons in the <BrainRegion>medullary reticular formation</BrainRegion>. By combining in situ hybridization detection of trkA mRNA with immunocytochemical detection of p75 nerve growth factor(NGF) R, it was determined that the vast majority (&amp;gt; 90%) of the trkA mRNA-containing cells detected in the <BrainRegion>medial septum</BrainRegion>(MS) and <BrainRegion>diagonal band of Broca</BrainRegion>(DBB) also express p75 nerve growth factor(NGF) R. Likewise, the vast majority of p75 nerve growth factor(NGF) R-IR cells detected in the <BrainRegion>medial septum</BrainRegion>(MS) and <BrainRegion>diagonal band of Broca</BrainRegion>(DBB) expressed trkA mRNA. Intracerebroventricular infusions of nerve growth factor(NGF) into the <BrainRegion>third ventricle</BrainRegion> adjacent to the <BrainRegion>preoptic area</BrainRegion> resulted in a 58% increase in relative cellular levels of trkA mRNA in the horizontal limb of the diagonal band of Broca(DBB) . These data provide evidence that both p75 nerve growth factor(NGF) R and trkA are expressed by nerve growth factor(NGF) -responsive neurons in the <BrainRegion>medial septum</BrainRegion>(MS) and <BrainRegion>diagonal band of Broca</BrainRegion>(DBB) . In addition, we note that areas that contained trkA mRNA and that also have been reported to contain p75 nerve growth factor(NGF) R are areas where high-affinity nerve growth factor(NGF) binding sites have been observed autoradiographically, whereas areas that contain either trkA or p75 nerve growth factor(NGF) R alone are areas where no high-affinity nerve growth factor(NGF) binding has been reported. Together, these findings suggest that both trkA and p75 nerve growth factor(NGF) R play an important role in the formation of high-affinity nerve growth factor(NGF) receptors in brain and, furthermore, suggest that nerve growth factor(NGF) may have physiological effects within many regions of the brain outside of the <BrainRegion>basal forebrain</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Patchy intrinsic projections in <BrainRegion>visual cortex</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>area 18</BrainRegion>, of the cat: morphological and immunocytochemical evidence for an excitatory function.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Small injections of peroxidase-labeled wheat germ agglutinin into cat <BrainRegion>area 18</BrainRegion> gave rise to patches of labeled cells and axon terminals around the injection site. In EM sections it was found that the labeled cells had a pattern of synaptic inputs characteristic of spiny-dendrite neurons (pyramidal or spiny stellate cells). The labeled axon terminals formed type 1 (asymmetric) synapses, most of which were made onto dendritic spines. In other experiments injections of fluorescent beads were made into <BrainRegion>area 18</BrainRegion>, giving rise to a similar patchy distribution of labeled cells. The sections were then processed for immunocytochemical demonstration of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). The bead-labeled cells in the patches were gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) negative. The findings suggest that the patchy projections mediate mutual excitation between groups of spiny-dendrite neurons.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Prenatal development of the human <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The development of the human <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion> has been studied on Nissl- and silver-stained sections from 61 fetal human brains collected during normal autopsy procedure. The age of the fetuses, which ranged from 16 to 40 (newborn) weeks was determined by comparing crown-to-rump lengths and body weights to the values published by Streeter (&apos;20). The development of the human <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion> is remarkably similar to that described for the rhesus monkey (Rakic, &apos;77). As a result of the late growth of the <BrainRegion>pulvinar</BrainRegion>, the human <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion> is displaced and rotated such that, at around week 24, the nucleus had come to lie along the ventrolateral border of the <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion>. The cellular laminae that characterize the adult nucleus are formed over a 3-week period of time beginning around the 22nd week of gestation. More caudal parts of the nucleus laminate first. During this same period of time, the optic disc representation in laminae 4 and 6 is also formed. Throughout most of the development of the human <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>, individual rows of cells can be seen extending across the nucleus. Although such rows of cells are best seen before the nucleus laminates, in older laminated nuclei the rows of cells are oriented either perpendicular or oblique, but never parallel, to the plane of the laminae. Previous findings in both the monkey ( remarkably similar to that described for the rhesus monkey(Rakic) , &apos;77) and human (Hickey and Guillery, '79) suggest it is possible that these rows of cells can be used to define the lines of projection through the nucleus. Incoming optic tract fibers run along, rather than perpendicular to, these rows of cells.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Multidimensional chemotopic responses to n-aliphatic acid odorants in the rat <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>In an effort to understand the means by which similar chemical odorants are encoded in the mammalian brain, we exposed rats to a homologous series of n-aliphatic acids and mapped the response of the entire <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> glomerular layer by using a high-resolution [14C]-2-deoxyglucose uptake technique. We found that these similar odorants evoked spatially clustered but distinct responses in the <BrainRegion>bulb</BrainRegion> that changed systematically with carbon chain length. In addition to these chemotopic responses, different odorants within the series evoked systematic differences along two other dimensions: amount of deoxyglucose uptake and extent of the glomerular layer showing high activity. Increases along these two dimensions also were correlated with increasing carbon number. The focal glomerular responses were mirrored by responses in deeper bulb layers. Decreasing the odorant concentration decreased the deoxyglucose uptake within focal regions. The focal regions of activity occurred in pairs involving both medial and lateral representations in the <BrainRegion>bulb</BrainRegion>, perhaps reflecting the paired medial and lateral projections of <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> sensory neurons expressing specific types of odorant feature receptor proteins. The observed spatial pattern of response also may explain both the failure of some <BrainRegion>bulb</BrainRegion> lesions to interfere with behavioral <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> responses and the success of other lesions in blocking <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> responses. These data support a model of parallel, distributed processing of odorants along multiple dimensions. They also support the notion that analyses of the spatial relationships among odorant responses in the <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> can demonstrate aspects of the mechanism for odor chemical coding.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>A serial section electron microscope study of an identified Ia afferent collateral in the cat <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Serial section electron microscopy has been used to examine a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labelled group Ia afferent collateral from its entry point in the grey matter to its termination in <BrainRegion>Clarke&apos;s column</BrainRegion> of the cat <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>. A wide range of geometries and myelination patterns were identified along the collateral, including 1) nodes specialized to exhibit a single synaptic bouton, 2) nodes specialized to exhibit two or more synaptic boutons connected by fine, unmyelinated lengths of the collateral, 3) terminal heminodes, along which boutons were separated by unmyelinated branches, and 4) complex arrangements along which myelinated and unmyelinated branches gave rise to one or more boutons. Thirty-six synaptic boutons of varied shape and size were exhibited by this collateral. Previous studies have shown that the geometry, branching, and myelination pattern of an axon play an important role in determining the amplitude and duration of an action potential propagating along that axon. In turn, the amplitude and duration of a presynaptic action potential influence the efficacy of transmitter release. The varied axonal geometries and myelination patterns observed in the present study provide further evidence in support of our previous proposal that there may be considerable nonuniformity in the efficacy of synaptic transmission among release sites arising from the same primary afferent fiber.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<AbstractText>Efferent and afferent connections of the <BrainRegion>dorsal and ventral respiratory groups in the medulla</BrainRegion> of the cat were mapped by axonal transport of wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase.

Major neuron populations with efferent projections to the regions of the <BrainRegion>dorsal and ventral respiratory groups</BrainRegion> include the <BrainRegion>parabrachial nuclear complex</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>medial parabrachial, lateral parabrachial, and Kölliker-Fuse nuclei</BrainRegion>), <BrainRegion>subregions of the lateral paragigantocellular reticular nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>subregions of the lateral and magnocellular tegmental fields</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>inferior central and postpyramidal nuclei of the raphe</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>sensory trigeminal nuclei</BrainRegion>. A previously unidentified neuron population with extensive efferent projections to the <BrainRegion>dorsal and ventral respiratory groups</BrainRegion> was found near the <BrainRegion>ventral surface of the rostral medulla</BrainRegion>; we refer to this group as the <BrainRegion>retrotrapezoid nucleus</BrainRegion>. The results suggest that the <BrainRegion>dorsal and ventral respiratory groups</BrainRegion> form an extensively interconnected neuronal system receiving convergent inputs from the same <BrainRegion>brainstem nuclear groups</BrainRegion>, consistent with the hypothesis that the dorsal and ventral groups are primarily sites for integration of sensory and premotor respiratory drive inputs. Neuron populations in the <BrainRegion>rostral ventrolateral medulla</BrainRegion> with projections to both the <BrainRegion>dorsal and ventral respiratory groups</BrainRegion>, particularly the <BrainRegion>retrotrapezoid nucleus</BrainRegion> and neighboring <BrainRegion>subregions of the lateral paragigantocellular reticular nucleus</BrainRegion>, are candidate sites for participation in respiratory rhythmogenesis or other critical functions of the <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion> respiratory control system such as intracranial chemoreception.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Spatial arrangement of <BrainRegion>cerebro-pontine</BrainRegion> terminals.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Understanding the interaction of the <BrainRegion>cerebral cortex</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>cerebellum</BrainRegion> requires knowledge of the highly complex spatial characteristics of cerebro-cerebellar signal transfer. <BrainRegion>Cerebro-pontine</BrainRegion> fibers from one <BrainRegion>neocortical site</BrainRegion> terminate in several sharply demarcated patches across large parts of the <BrainRegion>pontine nuclei</BrainRegion> (PN), and fibers from different <BrainRegion>neocortical areas</BrainRegion> terminate in the same <BrainRegion>pontine region</BrainRegion>. To determine whether projections from segregated <BrainRegion>neocortical sites</BrainRegion> overlap in the <BrainRegion>pontine nuclei</BrainRegion>(PN) , we studied double anterograde tracing of <BrainRegion>cerebro-pontine</BrainRegion> terminals from large parts of rat <BrainRegion>neocortex</BrainRegion>. In none of these experiments, including double injection into two functionally related areas, were we able to demonstrate overlapping patches, although close spatial relationships were always detected. This non-overlapping distribution is consistent with a compartmentalized organization of the <BrainRegion>cerebro-pontine</BrainRegion> projection and may be the basis of the fractured type of maps found in the <BrainRegion>cerebellar</BrainRegion> granular layer. The critical distance between two sites on the <BrainRegion>neocortical surface</BrainRegion> that project to non-overlapping patches in the <BrainRegion>pontine nuclei</BrainRegion>(PN) was found to be 600 microm, by using double injection within the whisker representation of the <BrainRegion>primary somatosensory area</BrainRegion>. This matches the diameter of dendritic trees of layer 5 projection neurons, indicating that non-overlapping populations of <BrainRegion>neocortical</BrainRegion> projection neurons possess non-overlapping patches of <BrainRegion>pontine</BrainRegion> terminals. Estimations based on this critical distance and the <BrainRegion>pontine</BrainRegion> volume anterogradely labeled by one injection site indicate that the size of the <BrainRegion>pontine nuclei</BrainRegion>(PN) may be well suited to accommodate a complete set of non-overlapping <BrainRegion>pontine</BrainRegion> patches from all possible <BrainRegion>neocortical sites</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Postnatal development of the <BrainRegion>cerebellar cortex</BrainRegion> in the rat. V. Spatial organization of purkinje cell perikarya.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The development of the spatial organization of Purkinje cell perikarya was examined in the rat <BrainRegion>cerebellum</BrainRegion> from birth to adulthood. Dispersion of the perikarya following birth is made possible by the rapid expansion of the <BrainRegion>cortical surface</BrainRegion>. Their subsequent regular monocellular alignment is ensured by mechanical factors, the pressure exerted from below by the expanding granular layer and the barrier formed above by the pile of parallel fibers which prevent the penetration of the bulky perikarya into the molecular layer. The perikarya remain in this position even after the slender stem dendrite pierces the molecular layer along the descending axons of basket cells. The increase in interperikaryal distance between Purkinje cells is rapid up to day 12, then declines. This is temporally associated with the growth of the basket cell plexus and glial envelope around the perikaryon. The increase in perikaryal size continues up to day 30. This may be temporally associated with the growth of the Purkinje cell dendritic arbor as reflected by the expansion of the molecular layer up to day 30. The spatial arrangement of Purkinje cells within the monocellular sheet was graphically displayed with computer aid. In the adult <BrainRegion>cerebellum</BrainRegion> a hexagonal arrangement could be recognized in a proportion of &quot;near-neighborhoods," consisting of about six Purkinje cells and their neighbors. When the neighborhoods were extended with fixed orientation with respect to the axis of the folium, the hexagonal arrangement disappeared. When orientation was ignored, the superimposed near-neighborhoods could be rotated to produce a hexagonal pattern. In the infant <BrainRegion>cerebellum</BrainRegion> the hexagonal arrangement could not be demonstrated before the alignment of Purkinje cells in a monolayer. Thereafter there appeared to be an increase with age in the proportion of hexagonally arranged near-neighborhoods. It was concluded that in the monocellular ganglionic layer Purkinje cells are not aligned in regular rows with respect to the geometrically arranged elements of the supraganglionic layer. The formation of an imprecise hexagonal pattern, like the alignment of Purkinje cells in a monolayer, was attributed to mechanical factors.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Distribution of the vanilloid receptor (VR1) in the gastrointestinal tract.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The gastrointestinal (GI) tract responds to a variety of stimuli through local and centrally mediated pathways. Changes in the intestinal microenvironment are sensed by vagal, spinal, and intrinsic primary afferent fibers. Sensory nerve endings located close to the lumen of the gastrointestinal(GI) tract respond to pH, chemical composition of lumenal contents, or distortion of the mucosa. Afferents within the muscle layers are thought to be tension sensitive, whereas those located within the myenteric plexus are also thought to respond to changes in chemical composition and humoral substances. Subpopulations of these afferent fibers are activated by capsaicin. However, the exact location of these nerves is currently not known. The vanilloid receptor (VR1) is a nonselective cation channel that is activated by capsaicin, acid, and temperature. Antibodies to VR1 make it possible to determine the location of these afferents, their morphology, and their relationships with enteric nerves and other cell types in the gastrointestinal(GI) tract. VR1-like immunoreactivity was observed on nerves within myenteric ganglia and interganglionic fiber tracts throughout the gastrointestinal(GI) tract. VR1 nerves were also observed within the muscle layers and had an irregular profile, with varicose-like swellings along their lengths. Blood vessels within the gastrointestinal(GI) wall had VR1-immunoreactive nerve fibers associated with them. VR1-like nerves and other immunopositive cells were also observed within the mucosa. In summary, VR1-like immunoreactivity was found in several locations within the gastrointestinal(GI) tract and may provide sensory integration of chemical, physical, or inflammatory stimuli. VR1-like fibers appear to be predominantly spinal in origin, but a few vagal VR1-like fibers exist in the stomach.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Visual cortical</BrainRegion> projections and chemoarchitecture of macaque monkey pulvinar.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>We investigated the patterns of projections from the <BrainRegion>pulvinar</BrainRegion> to <BrainRegion>visual areas V1</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>V2</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>V4</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>MT</BrainRegion>, and their relationships to <BrainRegion>pulvinar subdivisions</BrainRegion> based on patterns of calbindin (CB) immunostaining and estimates of visual field maps (P(1), P(2) and P(3)). Multiple retrograde tracers were placed into <BrainRegion>V1</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>V2</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>V4</BrainRegion>, and/or <BrainRegion>MT</BrainRegion> in 11 adult macaque monkeys. The <BrainRegion>inferior pulvinar</BrainRegion> (PI) was subdivided into medial ( pulvinar(PI) (M)), posterior ( pulvinar(PI) (P)), central medial ( pulvinar(PI) (CM)), and central lateral ( pulvinar(PI) (CL)) regions, confirming earlier calbindin(CB) studies. The P(1) map includes <BrainRegion>pulvinar</BrainRegion>(PI) (CL) and the <BrainRegion>ventromedial portion of the lateral pulvinar</BrainRegion> (PL), P(2) is found in <BrainRegion>ventrolateral pulvinar</BrainRegion>(PL) , and P(3) includes pulvinar(PI) (P), pulvinar(PI) (M), and pulvinar(PI) (CM). Projections to areas <BrainRegion>V1</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>V2</BrainRegion> were found to be overlapping in P(1) and P(2), but those from P(2) to <BrainRegion>V2</BrainRegion> were denser than those to <BrainRegion>V1</BrainRegion>. <BrainRegion>V2</BrainRegion> also received light projections from <BrainRegion>pulvinar</BrainRegion>(PI) (CM) and, less reliably, from <BrainRegion>pulvinar</BrainRegion>(PI) (M). Neurons projecting to <BrainRegion>V4</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>MT</BrainRegion> were more abundant than those projecting to <BrainRegion>V1</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>V2</BrainRegion>. Those projecting to <BrainRegion>V4</BrainRegion> were observed in P(1), densely in P(2), and also in <BrainRegion>pulvinar</BrainRegion>(PI) (CM) and <BrainRegion>pulvinar</BrainRegion>(PI) (P) of P(3). Those projecting to <BrainRegion>MT</BrainRegion> were found in P(1)- P(3), with the heaviest projection from P(3). Projections from P(3) to <BrainRegion>MT</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>V4</BrainRegion> were mainly interdigitated, with the densest to <BrainRegion>MT</BrainRegion> arising from <BrainRegion>pulvinar</BrainRegion>(PI) (M) and the densest to <BrainRegion>V4</BrainRegion> arising from <BrainRegion>pulvinar</BrainRegion>(PI) (P) and <BrainRegion>pulvinar</BrainRegion>(PI) (CM). Because the calbindin-rich and -poor regions of P(3) corresponded to differential patterns of <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> connectivity, the results suggest that calbindin(CB) may further delineate functional subdivisions in the <BrainRegion>pulvinar</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Cytoarchitecture, neuronal morphology, and some efferent connections of the <BrainRegion>interstitial nucleus of Cajal</BrainRegion> (INC) in the cat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>This study describes the cytoarchitecture and neuronal morphology of the <BrainRegion>interstitial nucleus of Cajal</BrainRegion> (INC) in the cat. In addition, the efferent projections of this nucleus to the spinal cord and inferior olive were studied by retrograde labelling with horseradish peroxidase (HRP). The <BrainRegion>interstitial nucleus of Cajal</BrainRegion>(INC) was shown to extend rostrocaudally for slightly more than 2 mm. Caudally, the nucleus consists of a small number of loosely aggregated neurons lying lateral to the <BrainRegion>ventral periaqueductal gray matter</BrainRegion> at a rostrocaudal level corresponding to the rostral one-fifth of the somatic cell columns of the <BrainRegion>oculomotor nucleus</BrainRegion>. Rostrally, the <BrainRegion>interstitial nucleus of Cajal</BrainRegion>(INC) increases in size and reaches its maximum development in its rostral half, where it lies ventrolateral to the <BrainRegion>nucleus of Darkschewitsch</BrainRegion> (ND). Rostrally the <BrainRegion>interstitial nucleus of Cajal</BrainRegion>(INC) is bounded by the dorsoventrally aligned fibres of the fasciculus retroflexus. Two groups of neurons could be distinguished within the <BrainRegion>interstitial nucleus of Cajal</BrainRegion>(INC) in both normal and horseradish peroxidase(HRP) -injected material. One group consists of a relatively small number of large, oval, pyramidal, fusiform, or multipolar neurons with mean dimensions of 40 X 26 micrometers. The second group consists of numerous small to medium-sized neurons with mean dimensions of 20 X 14 micrometers. Large neurons and some cells of the second group contain substantial amounts of Nissl substance throughout their perikarya. Some medium-sized to small neurons exhibit indentations in their nuclei, and glial cells are often apposed to their cell membranes. Golgi-Kopsch preparations taken from kitten showed that <BrainRegion>interstitial nucleus of Cajal</BrainRegion>(INC) neurons possess sparsely branched, radiating dendritic trees with few spinous processes. The majority of <BrainRegion>interstitial nucleus of Cajal</BrainRegion>(INC) neurons retrogradely labelled with horseradish peroxidase(HRP) exhibited similar dendritic patterns. Injections of horseradish peroxidase(HRP) into lesions at <BrainRegion>cervical, thoracic, or lumbar levels of the spinal cord</BrainRegion> resulted in retrograde labelling of neurons of all sizes and shapes throughout the entire length of the <BrainRegion>interstitial nucleus of Cajal</BrainRegion>(INC) . However, the greatest number of horseradish peroxidase(HRP) -labelled cells in <BrainRegion>interstitial nucleus of Cajal</BrainRegion>(INC) were observed subsequent to injections of the enzyme into <BrainRegion>cervical levels of the cord</BrainRegion>. Following injections of horseradish peroxidase(HRP) into the <BrainRegion>inferior olive</BrainRegion> only small to medium-sized neurons were labelled in the nucleus, the majority of which are located in <BrainRegion>rostral levels of the interstitial nucleus of Cajal</BrainRegion>(INC) . A substantial <BrainRegion>olivary</BrainRegion> projection was observed to originate in the <BrainRegion>nucleus of Darkschewitsch</BrainRegion> ( <BrainRegion>nucleus of Darkschewitsch</BrainRegion>(ND) ) and the <BrainRegion>nucleus parafascicularis</BrainRegion> (NPF). The sizes of the projections from these two nuclei to the <BrainRegion>inferior olive</BrainRegion> appeared to be much larger than that from the <BrainRegion>interstitial nucleus of Cajal</BrainRegion>(INC) . Smaller numbers of neurons were also observed in the <BrainRegion>rostral parvocellular red nucleus</BrainRegion> (RN) and <BrainRegion>mesencephalic reticular formation</BrainRegion> (MRF).</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Projections of the <BrainRegion>retinorecipient pretectal nuclei</BrainRegion> in the pigeon (Columba livia).</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>We have used anterograde autoradiographic and retrograde HRP techniques to investigate the efferent connections of the <BrainRegion>retinorecipient pretectal nuclei</BrainRegion> in the pigeon. In the accompanying paper we identified these nuclei in the pigeon as the <BrainRegion>nucleus lentiformis mesencephali--pars lateralis and pars medialis</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>tectal gray</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>area pretectalis</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>pretectalis diffusus</BrainRegion>. Although there are reports of a few of the projections of these nuclei, they had not previously been the subject of a detailed study. We found that different cell types in the <BrainRegion>lentiformis mesencephali, pars medialis</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>lentiformis mesencephali</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>pars lateralis</BrainRegion> have descending projections to different targets. These targets include the <BrainRegion>inferior olive</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>cerebellum</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>lateral pontine nucleus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>nucleus papillioformis</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the basal optic root</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>nucleus mesencephalicus profundus</BrainRegion>, pars ventralis, the <BrainRegion>nucleus principalis precommissuralis</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>stratum cellulare externum</BrainRegion>. We found that a few cells in the <BrainRegion>lentiformis mesencephali</BrainRegion> project to the <BrainRegion>medial pontine nucleus</BrainRegion>, but that a much heavier projection arises from the <BrainRegion>nucleus laminaris precommissuralis</BrainRegion>, which is <BrainRegion>medial to the nucleus lentiformis mesencephali, pars medialis</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>tectal gray</BrainRegion> has predominantly ascending projections to the <BrainRegion>diencephalon</BrainRegion>. The nuclei that it projects to are the <BrainRegion>nucleus intercalatus thalami</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the ventral supraoptic decussation</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>nucleus posteroventralis</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>ventral lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>nucleus dorsolateralis medialis</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>nucleus dorsolateralis anterior</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>tectal gray</BrainRegion> also projects topographically to layers 4 and 8-13 of the <BrainRegion>optic tectum</BrainRegion>. <BrainRegion>Area pretectalis</BrainRegion> has both ascending and descending projections. It has ipsilateral ascending projections to the <BrainRegion>nucleus dorsolateralis anterior</BrainRegion>, pars magnocellularis, the <BrainRegion>nucleus lateralis anterior</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>nucleus ventrolateralis thalami</BrainRegion>. It has ipsilateral descending projections to the <BrainRegion>central gray</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the basal optic root</BrainRegion>, pars dorsalis, the <BrainRegion>lateral pontine nucleus</BrainRegion>, and the deep layers of the <BrainRegion>optic tectum</BrainRegion>. It has contralateral projections to the <BrainRegion>area pretectalis</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>nucleus Campi Foreli</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>interstitial nucleus of Cajal</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>nucleus of Darkschewitsch</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>cerebellum</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>Edinger-Westphal nucleus</BrainRegion>. The efferent projections of <BrainRegion>pretectalis diffusus</BrainRegion> are limited. It projects contralaterally to the <BrainRegion>pretectalis diffusus</BrainRegion>, and ipsilaterally to the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the ventral supraoptic decussation</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>lateral pons</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>cerebellum</BrainRegion>.4</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Functional organization of mustached bat <BrainRegion>inferior colliculus</BrainRegion>: I. Representation of FM frequency bands important for target ranging revealed by 14C-2-deoxyglucose autoradiography and single unit mapping.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The representation in the <BrainRegion>inferior colliculus</BrainRegion> of the frequency modulated (FM) components of the first (25-30 kHz) and second (50-60 kHz) harmonic of the sonar signal of the mustached bat, which may be important for target range processing, was investigated by using the 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) technique and single-unit mapping. In the 2-deoxyglucose(2-DG) experiments, bats presented with second harmonic frequency modulated(FM) stimuli alone showed uptake of label in specific regions of the <BrainRegion>central nucleus and dorsal cortex of the inferior colliculus</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the brachium</BrainRegion>. In the <BrainRegion>central nucleus</BrainRegion>, a dorsoventrally and mediolaterally elongated slab at the caudal border of the anterolateral division was observed. Labeling in the <BrainRegion>dorsal cortex</BrainRegion> was contiguous with this band. Bats stimulated with pairs of first and second harmonic frequency modulated(FM) stimuli separated by short time delays showed similar patterns of labeling, with the addition of another dorsoventrally elongated region of uptake in the more rostral part of the anterolateral division, associated with label in the <BrainRegion>dorsal cortex</BrainRegion>. By comparison to control cases exposed to delayed pairs of first and third harmonic signals, or to a second harmonic constant-frequency tone burst at the bat&apos;s reference frequency (ca. 60 kHz), we deduced that this additional region of uptake was attributable to the first harmonic frequency modulated(FM) component. To elucidate further the details of the tonotopic organization and to correlate the frequency representation with anatomical features of the IC, fine-grained maps of single-unit best frequencies were obtained in the <BrainRegion>central nucleus</BrainRegion>. Isofrequency contours were reconstructed by computer from five bats after focal, iontophoretic injection of horseradish peroxidase to locate the penetrations and trace connections of the frequency modulated(FM) 2 area. We found that the tissue volume representing frequency modulated(FM) 2 frequencies (50-60 kHz) showed approximately a sixfold overrepresentation for this frequency band. This region occupied most of the caudal portion of the <BrainRegion>anterolateral division of the central nucleus</BrainRegion>. Only a single tonotopic representation was found in the <BrainRegion>central nucleus</BrainRegion>, consistent with the pattern seen in other mammals. However, isofrequency contours in the anterolateral division were oriented dorsoventrally, approximately parallel to the coronal plane. The small band of frequencies (ca. 60-62 kHz) associated with the dominant constant-frequency component of the biosonar signal was even more dramatically overrepresented (40x) and was confined to the dorsoposterior division, as previously reported by Zook et al. (1985, 530-456).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Localization of tyrosine hydroxylase in neuronal targets and efferents of the <BrainRegion>area postrema in the nucleus tractus solitarii</BrainRegion> of the rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Catecholamines in the <BrainRegion>nucleus tractus solitarii</BrainRegion> (NTS) have been implicated in autonomic responses to circulating hormones that act on neurons in the <BrainRegion>area postrema</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>most caudal circumventricular organ</BrainRegion> in brain. We combined immunoperoxidase labeling of the anterograde tracer, Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PHAL) with immunogold-silver labeling of tyrosine hydroxylase to determine whether this enzymatic marker for catecholamines was present in efferents from the <BrainRegion>area postrema</BrainRegion> or their targets in the rat <BrainRegion>nucleus tractus solitarii</BrainRegion>(NTS) . At survival periods of 10-12 days after Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin(PHAL) injections into the <BrainRegion>area postrema</BrainRegion>, light microscopy revealed numerous varicose processes containing peroxidase reaction product for Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin(PHAL) in the <BrainRegion>dorsomedial, medial, and commissural nucleus tractus solitarii</BrainRegion>(NTS) . Some of these labeled processes were located near neuronal perikarya and processes containing immunogold-silver intensified reaction product for tyrosine hydroxylase. Electron microscopy of the <BrainRegion>commissural and dorsomedial nucleus tractus solitarii</BrainRegion>(NTS) established that the majority of the labeling for Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin(PHAL) was in axon terminals, whereas immunogold labeling for tyrosine hydroxylase was mainly in soma and dendrites. Only 3 out of 579 Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin(PHAL) -labeled terminals also contained detectable tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity. Fifty-eight percent (335/579) of the Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin(PHAL) -labeled terminals formed synapses with recognized symmetric junctions, whereas the remainder lacked synaptic specializations within the examined series of serial sections. Of those Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin(PHAL) terminals forming recognized symmetric junctions, 22% were on tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive dendrites, 74% on unlabeled dendrites and 4% on unlabeled axon terminals. From a total of 1,250 observed contacts on tyrosine hydroxylase labeled dendrites, 88 (7%) contained Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin(PHAL) , 9 (&amp;lt; 1%) contained TH, and 1,180 (93%) lacked detectable immunoreactivity and formed primarily symmetric synapses. We conclude that a few catecholamine, but mainly noncatecholamine efferents from the <BrainRegion>area postrema</BrainRegion> provide a monosynaptic, and most likely inhibitory input to target neurons both with and without tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity in the <BrainRegion>dorsomedial and commissural nucleus tractus solitarii</BrainRegion>(NTS) . Synapses between the efferent terminals from the <BrainRegion>area postrema</BrainRegion> and tyrosine hydroxylase labeled and unlabeled dendrites as well as unlabeled axons in these specific <BrainRegion>subnuclei of the nucleus tractus solitarii</BrainRegion>(NTS) suggest multiple sites for modulation of gastric and cardiovascular reflexes in response to circulating peptides.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Two modes of cutaneous reinnervation following peripheral nerve injury.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The return of sensation to the foot following sciatic nerve crush injury was analyzed behaviorally and electrophysiologically in the rat. Functional recovery begins within four days. Its early phase is accounted for by expansion of the functional distribution of intact neighboring fibers of the saphenous n. It occurs even if the sciatic n. is ligated, and it disappears with section of the saphenous n. Accompanying this functional expansion we began to encounter in electrophysiological recordings from the saphenous n., fibers with unusually large receptive fields (RF&apos;s) extending onto the plantar surface of the foot, well beyond their limits in intact rats. All of the expanded RF's were high threshold mechanoreceptors. On about the twentieth day after crushing, the regenerating sciatic n. began to make a functional contribution. This was seen by return of sensation to zones not invaded by the saphenous n. and by the onset of sensation in rats in which the saphenous n. had previously been ligated. With return of the sciatic n. the expanded distribution of the saphenous n. went back to its original boundaries. Correspondingly, we could no longer find expanded saphenous n. RF's. We conclude that cutaneous reinnervation begins with the collateral expansion of high threshold afferents from intact neighboring nerves. This alien innervation is later replaced upon regeneration of the original nerve.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Laminar distribution of synaptopodin in normal and reeler mouse brain depends on the position of spine-bearing neurons.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Synaptopodin is the first member of a novel class of proline-rich actin-associated proteins. In brain, it is present in the neck of a subset of mature <BrainRegion>telencephalic</BrainRegion> spines and is associated closely with the spine apparatus, a Ca(2+) storing organelle within the spine compartment. The characteristic region- and lamina-specific distribution of synaptopodin in rat brain suggested that the distribution pattern of synaptopodin depends on the cytoarchitectonic arrangement of spine-bearing neurons. To test this hypothesis, synaptopodin was studied in the <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>striatum</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion> of normal and reeler mice, in which developmental cell migration defects have disrupted the normal array of cells. In situ hybridization histochemistry as well as light- and electron microscopic immunocytochemistry were used. In brain of normal mice, the pattern of synaptopodin mRNA-expressing cells corresponds to that of spine-bearing neurons and synaptopodin protein is found in a region- and lamina-specific distribution pattern. It is specifically sorted to the spine neck where it is associated closely with the spine apparatus. In brain of reeler mice, the pattern of synaptopodin mRNA-expressing cells corresponds to that of the abnormally positioned spine-bearing neurons and the region- and lamina-specific distribution pattern is absent or altered. Nevertheless, synaptopodin was specifically sorted to the spine neck, as in controls. These data demonstrate that the light microscopic distribution pattern of synaptopodin protein depends on the position and orientation of the spine-bearing neurons. The intracellular sorting process, however, is independent of positional cues.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Hippocampal</BrainRegion> mossy fibers induce assembly and clustering of PSD95-containing <BrainRegion>postsynaptic densities</BrainRegion> independent of glutamate receptor activation.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Factors that regulate the formation, spatial patterning, and maturation of CNS synapses are poorly understood. We used organotypic <BrainRegion>hippocampal</BrainRegion> slice cultures derived from developing (P5-P7) rat to test whether synaptic activity regulates the development and organization of postsynaptic structures at mossy fiber (MF) giant synapses. Antibodies to a prominent postsynaptic density (PSD) scaffold protein, postsynaptic density(PSD) 95, identified large (&amp;gt;1 microm) and irregularly shaped postsynaptic density(PSD) assemblies that codistributed with synapsin-I or metabotropic glutamate receptor 7b (mGluR7b) -immunolabeled mossy fiber(MF) terminals in area <BrainRegion>CA3</BrainRegion>. To investigate the spatial organization of synaptic postsynaptic density(PSD) s on individual pyramidal cells, neurons in slice cultures were transfected with a vector encoding a GFP- postsynaptic density(PSD) 95 fusion protein. Confocal three-dimensional reconstructions revealed clusters of postsynaptic density(PSD) s along proximal dendrites of transfected pyramidal neurons in <BrainRegion>area CA3</BrainRegion>, but not in <BrainRegion>CA1</BrainRegion>. Clusters averaged 7.6 microm in length (range, 2.2-29 microm) and contained up to 35 individual postsynaptic density(PSD) s (mean, 8.3). postsynaptic density(PSD) clusters failed to form when slices were cultured without mossy fiber(MF) s, indicating that mossy fiber(MF) s induce cluster assembly. Chronic blockade of N-methyl-D-apartate- and AMPA/kainate-type glutamate receptors did not disrupt mossy fiber(MF) targeting or de novo formation of postsynaptic density(PSD) clusters with a normal distribution on target cells. Additionally, glutamate receptor blockers did not alter the ultrastructural development of mossy fiber(MF) giant synapses containing multiple puncta adherens-like junctions and asymmetric synaptic junctions at dendritic shaft and spine domains, respectively. The results indicate that mossy fiber(MF) axons can induce the assembly and clustering of postsynaptic density(PSD) 95-containing postsynaptic complexes, displaying a normal subcellular and tissue distribution, by mechanisms that are independent of ionotropic glutamate receptor activation.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Juxtacapsular nucleus of the stria terminalis</BrainRegion> of the adult rat: extrinsic inputs, cell types, and neuronal modules: a combined Golgi and electron microscopic study.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>This study unravels the microscopic organization of the <BrainRegion>juxtacapsular nucleus of the bed nuclei of the stria terminalis</BrainRegion> (Ju) by using silver impregnation and electron microscopic techniques. Examination of Golgi-impregnated specimens demonstrates that the <BrainRegion>Ju</BrainRegion> has precise boundaries primarily determined by a conical condensation of fibers of the <BrainRegion>stria terminalis</BrainRegion> (StT) around the nucleus. The <BrainRegion>internal capsule</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>ansa peduncularis</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>medial forebrain</BrainRegion> bundle together with the <BrainRegion>stria terminalis</BrainRegion>(StT) provide extrinsic afferents to the neuropil of the <BrainRegion>Ju</BrainRegion>. Two main neuron types are found in the <BrainRegion>Ju</BrainRegion>: interneurons (including basket and neurogliaform cells) and projection neurons (bipolar and small pyramidal cells). The bipolar cell type accounts for about 80% of the sampled neurons. Short-axon neurons located within the <BrainRegion>dorsal part of the Ju</BrainRegion> send descending fibers that appear to terminate on the bipolar neurons, suggesting the existence of vertically oriented functional units within the nucleus. With the electron microscope, <BrainRegion>Ju</BrainRegion> neurons are seen in clusters of two or three neurons coupled by gap junctions. The neuropil contains numerous dendrites, axons, myelinated axons, and several types of synaptic interactions, including axospinous, axoshaft, and axosomatic. Within the neuropil, <BrainRegion>Ju</BrainRegion> neurons appear to be presynaptically modulated by axoaxonal interactions. The present findings suggest a model wherein bipolar neurons represent the output system of the <BrainRegion>Ju</BrainRegion> controlled by the interneurons, which would, in turn, be modulated by collaterals arising from the tributary fiber tracts. Additional neural interaction between <BrainRegion>Ju</BrainRegion> neurons utilizes gap junction-mediated electrotonic coupling.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Androgen receptor immunoreactivity in skeletal muscle: enrichment at the neuromuscular junction.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Potential cellular targets of androgen action within skeletal muscle of the rat were determined by comparing the cellular distribution of androgen receptor (AR)-positive nuclei in the highly androgen-responsive levator ani (LA) muscle with that of the relatively androgen-unresponsive extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle. We found that androgen responsiveness correlates with androgen receptor(AR) expression in muscle fibers and not in fibroblasts. Results indicate that a much higher percentage of myonuclei in the levator ani(LA) are androgen receptor(AR) (+) than in the extensor digitorum longus(EDL) (74% vs. 7%), correlating with differences in androgen responsiveness. Both muscles contain an equivalent proportion of androgen receptor(AR) (+) fibroblasts (approximately 62%). androgen receptor(AR) (+) nuclei were not observed in terminal Schwann cells in either muscle. These results suggest that androgen receptor(AR) s within levator ani(LA) muscle fibers mediate the androgen-dependent survival and growth of the levator ani(LA) muscle and its motoneurons. We also observed an unexpected enrichment of androgen receptor(AR) (+) myonuclei and fibroblasts proximate to neuromuscular junctions, suggesting that androgen receptor(AR) s at muscle synapses may selectively regulate synapse-specific genes important for the survival and growth of motoneurons. Although castration reduced the proportion of androgen receptor(AR) (+) fibroblasts in both muscles, the proportion of androgen receptor(AR) (+) myonuclei was reduced only in the levator ani(LA) . As expected, testosterone treatment prevented these effects of castration but, unexpectedly, increased the proportion of androgen receptor(AR) (+) myonuclei in the extensor digitorum longus(EDL) to above normal. These results suggest that how androgen receptor(AR) expression in skeletal muscle is influenced by androgens depends not only on the particular muscle but on the particular cell type within that muscle.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Development of the pyramidal tract in the hamster. II. An electron microscopic study.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>We undertook a qualitative and quantitative electron microscopic study of the growth and development of the pyramidal tract in the hamster to investigate the mode of growth of the axons, the possibility of fiber degeneration during development, and the process of myelination. By calculating the total fiber number as the product of axon density and tract area for several postnatal ages, we found that the pyramidal tract grows through the <BrainRegion>medulla</BrainRegion> as a compact bundle containing nearly twice the number of fibers as the mature tract. During the second postnatal week there is a substantial loss of axons followed in the third and fourth weeks by a more gradual loss such that by 34 days after birth the total number of axons reaches the adult value. Myelination in the hamster pyramidal tract begins at 7 days and continues at a very slow rate until the third postnatal week, when a dramatic increase in myelin formation occurs. By 34 days after birth the number of myelinated axons is approximately 80% that of the adult. as has been reported for other CNS tracts, there does not seem to be a &quot;critical diameter" of an axon that absolutely determines the presence or absence of myelin on a fiber. However, all axons above 0.5 micron in diameter are myelinated at approximately the same rate, while those under this diameter are myelinated much more slowly and even in the adult make up only a small percentage of the total myelinated fibers.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Intrinsic connections of the <BrainRegion>retrohippocampal region</BrainRegion> in the rat brain. II. The <BrainRegion>medial entorhinal area</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The present study describes the efferent projections and terminal distributions within the <BrainRegion>retrohippocampal region</BrainRegion> of individual layers of the rat <BrainRegion>medial entorhinal area</BrainRegion> (MEA) as studied by the methods of anterograde transport of the lectin Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) and retrograde transport of the fluorescent dye Fast Blue (FB). Analysis of the Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin(PHA-L) injections that were relatively well restricted to single layers of the <BrainRegion>medial entorhinal area</BrainRegion>(MEA) reveals very sparse projections to the <BrainRegion>parasubiculum</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>presubiculum</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>subiculum</BrainRegion>, while numerous projections within the <BrainRegion>medial entorhinal area</BrainRegion>(MEA) are found. The course and the termination of the intra-<BrainRegion>entorhinal</BrainRegion> projections differ depending upon the particular layer under study, and marked differences are found between the deep and the superficial layers in terms of the divergence of their respective projections. However, the general intra-<BrainRegion>entorhinal</BrainRegion> orientation of these projections is essentially the same for all layers: longitudinal with a slightly oblique course, such that at ventral levels the center of a particular terminal field is always located lateral to the center of the respective Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin(PHA-L) injection. Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin(PHA-L) injections into layer II label axons running horizontally within this layer as well as within the deep part of layer I, and Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin(PHA-L) injections into the medial sector of layer II reveal horizontal projections that innervate most of the second layer. The horizontal projections of layer III are more restricted than those of layer II but both layer II and III have prominent longitudinal projections directed ventrally. From layers II and III, numerous axons project to the deep layers (IV-VI) probably en route to <BrainRegion>extra-entorhinal structures</BrainRegion>, since no major terminal fields were detected in the deep layers. The Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin(PHA-L) and the Fast Blue(FB) experiments show that the deep layers (in particular IV and VI) have far more divergent intra-<BrainRegion>entorhinal</BrainRegion> projections than have layers II and III. Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin(PHA-L) injections into layers IV, V, and VI reveal widespread efferent projections to all of the more superficially located layers of the <BrainRegion>medial entorhinal area</BrainRegion>(MEA) in addition to projections to the <BrainRegion>lateral EA</BrainRegion>. The retrograde transport studies show that layers IV and VI are the major sources of these divergent projections and that cells situated throughout the entire medial to lateral width of these layers project to every sector of the <BrainRegion>retrohippocampal region</BrainRegion>. Taken together, the findings of the present experiments suggest that (1) all layers of the <BrainRegion>medial entorhinal area</BrainRegion>(MEA) have longitudinal projections directed primarily toward the ventral (or temporal) part of this <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion>, (2) the projections of layers II and III are relatively restricted compared of the deeper layers.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Cell cycle kinetics in the embryonic mouse <BrainRegion>corpus striatum</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Cells of the <BrainRegion>corpus striatum</BrainRegion> arise from the lateral ganglionic eminence of the <BrainRegion>telencephalic</BrainRegion> neuroepithelium. In mice, the length of the cell cycle and that of its component phases were estimated, and the interkinetic nuclear migratory pattern was characterized for lateral ganglionic progenitors on embryonic day 11 and 12 to gain insights into <BrainRegion>striatal</BrainRegion> cytogenetic process. An S-phase labeling paradigm using bromodeoxyuridine was employed. To assess regional variation in proliferative patterns, rostral, middle and caudal levels of the ganglionic neuroepithelium were examined separately. The pattern of interkinetic nuclear migration and the duration of G1-, G2-, and M-phases at the rostral and middle levels differed from those at the caudal level. The length of the cell cycle and that of the G1-phase increased during the interval embryonic day 11 to 12, especially at the rostral and middle levels. During the same interval, a sizable secondary proliferative population emerged at all three levels. Two principal conclusions are drawn: Progenitors at the different rostrocaudal levels are heterogeneous with regard to the pattern of cellular proliferation, and ganglionic progenitors are in advance of the <BrainRegion>cerebral</BrainRegion> <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> progenitors based on the relative size of the secondary proliferative population and the magnitude of cytokinetic parameters. Thus, proliferative behavior distinguishes progenitor populations at different rostrocaudal levels within the lateral ganglionic neuroepithelium and across the ganglionic and <BrainRegion>cerebral</BrainRegion> <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> domains of the <BrainRegion>telencephalic</BrainRegion> neuroepithelium.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Ultrastructural features of the acetylcholine innervation in the developing <BrainRegion>parietal cortex</BrainRegion> of rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>To follow on a recent quantitative study of the developing cholinergic (ACh) innervation in rat <BrainRegion>neocortex</BrainRegion>, axon varicosities identified by electron microscopic immunocytochemistry with a highly sensitive antibody against choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) were examined in the <BrainRegion>primary somatosensory area</BrainRegion> (Par1) of rats at postnatal ages (days) P8, P16, and P32. As visualized and measured in single thin sections, and compared with those of unlabeled varicosities selected at random in the same photomicrographs, the choline acetyltransferase(ChAT) -immunostained profiles displayed intrinsic and relational features very similar to those previously described in the same <BrainRegion>cortical area</BrainRegion> of adult rat (Umbriaco et al. [1994] J. Comp. Neurol. 348:351-373). At the three postnatal ages, the immunoreactive profiles were comparable in shape, size, and vesicular content in all <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> layers, but showed an increasing frequency of mitochondria with age, reaching 44% at P32. Synaptic junctions were observed on 6.3 to 8.7% of these sectional profiles, indicating an average synaptic incidence of 17% for whole varicosities, again comparable to that in the adult (14%). As in adult, the junctions made by the rare synaptic choline acetyltransferase(ChAT) -immunostained varicosities were always single, usually symmetrical, and more frequently found on dendritic branches than spines. Thus, cortical ACh varicosities displayed intrinsic and relational features similar to adult ones as soon as this innervation was installed, suggesting that a diffuse mode of transmission and ambient level of ACh could play a major role in the diverse effects of this neuromodulator during <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> development.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Some afferent and efferent connections of the <BrainRegion>vestibular nuclear complex</BrainRegion> in the red-eared turtle Pseudemys scripta elegans.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>In the present study some afferent, <BrainRegion>commissural</BrainRegion>, and efferent connections of the <BrainRegion>vestibular nuclear complex</BrainRegion> in the turtle Pseudemys scripta elegans were demonstrated with the HRP tracing technique. Afferent projections to the <BrainRegion>vestibular nuclei</BrainRegion> were found to arise in the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the basal optic root</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>interstitial nucleus of the fasciculus longitudinalis medialis</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>medial and lateral cerebellar nuclei</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>perihypoglossal nuclear complex</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>reticular formation</BrainRegion>. Distinct <BrainRegion>commissural</BrainRegion> projections appeared to arise in the <BrainRegion>dorsolateral, ventromedial, and descending vestibular nuclei</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>commissural</BrainRegion> projection arising in the <BrainRegion>ventrolateral vestibular nucleus</BrainRegion> appeared to be only sparsely developed. Both ascending and descending efferent projections were demonstrated to arise from the <BrainRegion>vestibular nuclear complex</BrainRegion>. The ascending vestibulo-oculomotor projection was found to be organized in an ipsilateral pathway arising in the <BrainRegion>dorsolateral vestibular nucleus</BrainRegion> and in a contralateral pathway, arising mainly in the <BrainRegion>medial vestibular nucleus</BrainRegion>. These projections appeared to be directed to the <BrainRegion>interstitial nucleus of the fasciculus longitudinalis medialis</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>oculomotor</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>trochlear</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>abducens nuclei</BrainRegion>. Also the <BrainRegion>perihypoglossal nuclear complex</BrainRegion> appeared to be an important target of vestibular efferents. The origin and course in the <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion> of the descending vestibular projections, i.e., the lateral and medial vestibulospinal tracts, as demonstrated in previous anatomical and experimental studies in reptiles, were confirmed. However, in addition a direct projection of the vestibulospinal tracts to presumably neck motoneurons was found. THe organization of the vestibular connections observed in the turtle Pseudemys scripta elegans appeared to be basically comparable to the organization of the vestibular connections in birds and mammals.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Descending projections from the <BrainRegion>nucleus raphe obscurus</BrainRegion> to pudendal motoneurons in the male rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Previous physiological and behavioral studies have shown that the <BrainRegion>nucleus raphe obscurus</BrainRegion> (nRO) modulates pelvic floor reflex function (Yamanouchi and Kakeyama [1992] Physiol. Behav. 51:575-579; Beattie et al. [1996] Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 22:722.4; Holmes et al. [1997] Brain Res. 759:197-204). In the present study, small injections of fluorescent tracers were used to investigate direct descending projections from the <BrainRegion>rostral and caudal portions of the brainstem nucleus raphe obscurus</BrainRegion>(nRO) to retrogradely labeled pudendal motoneurons (MN) in the male rat. The <BrainRegion>caudal nucleus raphe obscurus</BrainRegion>(nRO) projects into the <BrainRegion>ventral and lateral funiculi of the spinal cord</BrainRegion>, with arborizations in the <BrainRegion>thoracic intermediolateral cell column</BrainRegion>; in laminae VII, IX, and X of the <BrainRegion>lumbosacral cord</BrainRegion>; and in the <BrainRegion>sacral parasympathetic nucleus</BrainRegion> (SPN). Many identified external anal sphincter and ischiocavernosus motoneurons(MN) s appeared to be in direct apposition with fibers originating from the <BrainRegion>caudal nucleus raphe obscurus</BrainRegion>(nRO) ; and more than half of the bulbospongiosus motoneurons(MN) s that were identified appeared to receive such descending input. In addition to the <BrainRegion>nucleus raphe obscurus</BrainRegion>(nRO) <BrainRegion>spinal</BrainRegion> autonomic and pudendal motoneuronal targets, projections were observed to regions of the <BrainRegion>intermediate gray</BrainRegion> that contain interneurons organizing the pelvic floor reflexes and to motoneurons(MN) pools that are involved in functionally related somatic activities. Finally, several neurons in the lumbar enlargement were labeled retrogradely with FluoroRuby after injections into the <BrainRegion>nucleus raphe obscurus</BrainRegion>(nRO) and the immediately adjacent <BrainRegion>reticular formation</BrainRegion>. Thus, the <BrainRegion>nucleus raphe obscurus</BrainRegion>(nRO) may be in a position to modulate the coordinated actions of autonomic preganglionic and functionally related skeletal motoneurons(MN) activity involved in sexual and eliminative reflex functions.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Interaction between cholinergic neurons and substance P or calcitonin gene-related peptide terminals of the rat <BrainRegion>sacral intermediolateral nucleus</BrainRegion>: double immunostaining at the light and electron microscopic levels.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The relationships both between cholinergic neurons and substance P (SP) and between cholinergic neurons and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) terminals were examined in the rat <BrainRegion>sacral intermediolateral nucleus</BrainRegion> at the light and electron microscopic levels by means of double-immunostaining methods. Cholinergic neurons were labeled by a monoclonal antibody to choline acetyltransferase (CAT) with the avidin-biotin technique and stained bluish-green by indolyl-beta-galactoside reaction products with beta-galactosidase as a marker. On the same sections, substance P(SP) or calcitonin gene-related peptide(CGRP) fibers were labeled by polyclonal antisera to substance P(SP) or calcitonin gene-related peptide(CGRP) after application of the peroxidase-antiperoxidase (PAP) method and stained brown by the p-dimethylaminoazobenzene (DAB) reaction. After embedding in Epon, light and electron microscopic sections were examined. At the light microscopic level, calcitonin gene-related peptide(CGRP) -like immunoreactive ( calcitonin gene-related peptide(CGRP) -I) fibers and substance P(SP) -like immunoreactive ( substance P(SP) -I) fibers were found to pass through the lateral edge of the <BrainRegion>dorsal horn</BrainRegion> and then into the <BrainRegion>dorsal region of the sacral intermediolateral nucleus</BrainRegion>. In addition, substance P(SP) -I fibers also extend from the <BrainRegion>dorsolateral funiculus</BrainRegion> into the entire <BrainRegion>sacral intermediolateral region</BrainRegion>. At the electron microscopic level, many axosomatic and axodendritic synapses were found between choline acetyltransferase(CAT) -I structures and substance P(SP) -I terminals in the <BrainRegion>intermediolateral nucleus</BrainRegion>, whereas most of the calcitonin gene-related peptide(CGRP) -I terminals in this area made axodendritic synapses with choline acetyltransferase(CAT) -I dendrites. These results indicate that cholinergic neurons in the <BrainRegion>sacral intermediolateral nucleus</BrainRegion> receive direct synaptic input from substance P(SP) -I and calcitonin gene-related peptide(CGRP) -I terminals.(ABSTRACT TRUN choline acetyltransferase(CAT) ED AT 250 WORDS)</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Intercellular junctions in the developing <BrainRegion>arachnoid membrane</BrainRegion> in the chick.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The <BrainRegion>arachnoid membrane</BrainRegion> of chick embryos was prepared for electron microscopic study by means of thin sections and freeze-fracture replicas. Particular attention was given to the relationships among junctional complexes during <BrainRegion>arachnoid</BrainRegion> maturation. By 14 days of incubation, the <BrainRegion>arachnoid</BrainRegion> had differentiated into morphologically distinct inner and outer zones. Both desmosomes and gap junctions were present among the cells of both layers at this time. Desmosomes were most numerous in the inner arachnoid layer and their structure remained constant. Gap junctions showed a great variation in structure. The large gap junctions contained a particle packing pattern in which rows of intramembranous particles were separated by particle-free zones. Arched gap junctions were also present. Smaller arrays of gap junctions exhibited a variety of configurations on the membrane P-face. The first tight-junctional stands clearly identifiable in freeze-fractured preparations appeared at 15-17 days. These were closely associated with the particles of gap junctions and consisted of single stands on the P-face. By hatching age (21 days) a &quot;mature" pattern of tight-junctional strands was interwoven in several layers. In the interim, more complex arrangements of tight-junctional strands were in intimate relation with gap junctions.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Seven protein tyrosine phosphatases are differentially expressed in the developing rat brain.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Regulation of protein function through tyrosine phosphorylation is critical in the control of many developmental processes, such as cellular proliferation and differentiation. Growing evidence suggests that tyrosine phosphorylation also regulates key events in neural development. Although a large body of data has demonstrated that protein tyrosine kinases play an important role in neural development, much less is known about their counterparts, protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases). Using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with degenerate primers and a neonatal rat <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion> cDNA library, we have identified seven protein tyrosine phosphatases(PTPases) expressed in the developing rat brain. Four of these are transmembrane protein tyrosine phosphatases(PTPases) : LAR, LRP, RPTP gamma, and CPTP1. Three are nonreceptor protein tyrosine phosphatases(PTPases) : PTP-1, P19-PTP, and SHP. Northern hybridization analysis demonstrates that only CPTP1 is preferentially expressed in neural tissues, whereas the others are found abundantly in nonneural tissues as well as in the brain. Within the embryonic and early postnatal brain, the seven protein tyrosine phosphatases(PTPases) have overlapping, yet unique, distributions. For example, LAR mRNA is highly expressed by both proliferating and postmitotic cells in the <BrainRegion>cerebral cortex</BrainRegion> at embryonic day 17 and in all layers of the <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion> at postnatal day 4. In contrast, RPTP gamma mRNA is expressed by postmitotic neurons in the embryo and predominantly by neurons in the superficial layers of the postnatal <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion>. Several of the protein tyrosine phosphatases(PTPases) examined here are expressed at very high levels in the embryonic <BrainRegion>cortical plate</BrainRegion> and postnatal <BrainRegion>neocortex</BrainRegion>, including the <BrainRegion>subplate and subventricular zone</BrainRegion>. The spatial and temporal regulation of PTPase gene expression suggests that these protein tyrosine phosphatases(PTPases) have important roles in signal transduction during early neuronal differentiation and neural development.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Thalamic</BrainRegion> input to <BrainRegion>inferior area 6</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>area 4</BrainRegion> in the macaque monkey.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Recent cytoarchitectonic, histochemical, and hodological studies in primates have shown that <BrainRegion>area 6</BrainRegion> is formed by three main sectors: the <BrainRegion>supplementary motor area</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>superior area 6</BrainRegion>, which lies medial to the <BrainRegion>spur of the arcuate sulcus</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>inferior area 6</BrainRegion>, which is located lateral to it. <BrainRegion>Inferior area 6</BrainRegion> has been further subdivided into two histochemical areas: <BrainRegion>area F5</BrainRegion>, located along the <BrainRegion>inferior limb of the arcuate sulcus</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>area F4</BrainRegion>, located between <BrainRegion>area F5</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>area 4</BrainRegion> <BrainRegion>(area F1</BrainRegion>). The present study traced the thalamocortical projections of <BrainRegion>inferior area 6</BrainRegion> and the adjacent part of <BrainRegion>area 4</BrainRegion> by injecting small amounts of WGA-HRP in specific sectors of the <BrainRegion>agranular frontal cortex</BrainRegion>. Our data showed that each histochemical area receives a large projection from one nucleus of the <BrainRegion>ventrolateral thalamus</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>motor thalamus</BrainRegion>) and additional projections from other nuclei of this <BrainRegion>thalamic sector</BrainRegion>. <BrainRegion>Area F5</BrainRegion> receives a large projection from <BrainRegion>area X of Olszewski</BrainRegion> (&apos;52) and additional projections from the <BrainRegion>caudal part of the nucleus ventralis posterior lateralis, pars oralis</BrainRegion> (VPLo), and the <BrainRegion>nucleus ventralis lateralis, pars caudalis</BrainRegion> (VLc) (VPLo-VLc complex). <BrainRegion>Area F4</BrainRegion> receives a large projection from the <BrainRegion>nucleus ventralis lateralis, pars oralis</BrainRegion> (VLo), and additional projections from <BrainRegion>area X</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>VPLo-VLc complex</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>rostral part of area F1</BrainRegion> is innervated chiefly by <BrainRegion>VLo</BrainRegion>, plus smaller contributions from <BrainRegion>rostral VPLo</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>VPLo-VLc complex</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>caudal part of F1</BrainRegion> receives its greatest input from <BrainRegion>VPLo</BrainRegion>, with a small contribution from <BrainRegion>VLo</BrainRegion>. In addition, each histochemical area receives projections originating from the <BrainRegion>intralaminar thalamic nuclei</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>posterior thalamus</BrainRegion>, and--for <BrainRegion>area F4</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>area F5</BrainRegion>--also from the <BrainRegion>nucleus medialis dorsalis</BrainRegion> (MD). Analysis of the physiological properties of the various histochemical areas in relation to their main <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> input showed that those <BrainRegion>cortical fields</BrainRegion> in which distal movements are predominant (<BrainRegion>area F5</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>caudal part of area F1</BrainRegion>) are innervated chiefly by <BrainRegion>area X</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>VPLo</BrainRegion>, whereas those <BrainRegion>cortical fields</BrainRegion> in which proximal movements are predominant receive their main input from <BrainRegion>VLo</BrainRegion>. Because <BrainRegion>VPLo</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>area X</BrainRegion> are targets of cerebellothalamic pathways, whereas <BrainRegion>VLo</BrainRegion> receives a <BrainRegion>pallidal</BrainRegion> input, we propose that the <BrainRegion>cortical fields</BrainRegion> in which distal movements are most heavily represented are mainly under the influence of the <BrainRegion>cerebellum</BrainRegion>, whereas the <BrainRegion>cortical fields</BrainRegion> in which proximal movements are most heavily represented are mainly under the influence of the <BrainRegion>basal ganglia</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Derivation of <BrainRegion>cerebellar</BrainRegion> Golgi neurons from the external granular layer: evidence from explantation of external granule cells in vivo.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The present report provides evidence to challenge the traditional view that <BrainRegion>cerebellar</BrainRegion> Golgi cells are derived from the ventricular neuroepithelium, postulating instead that they originate from external granule cells. Supporting evidence for this assertion comes from three sources: 1) Typical Golgi cells are found in ectopic granule cell colonies, both outside the <BrainRegion>cerebellum</BrainRegion> (in the <BrainRegion>subarachnoid space</BrainRegion>) and also within the <BrainRegion>cerebellar cortex</BrainRegion> between fused folia. Because ectopic granule cell colonies are derived from external granule cells, which become displaced after treatment with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), it was assumed that the ectopic Golgi cells also stem from such displaced external granule cells. 2) In order to demonstrate that Golgi cell precursors migrate from the external granular layer into the Purkinje cell plate, the development of the <BrainRegion>cerebellar cortex</BrainRegion> was studied over the period of Golgi cell genesis. On E19 the external granular layer in the rat is subdivided into an outer proliferative and an inner subproliferative zone. At the inner margin of the external granular layer, and in the marginal zone, radially oriented, darkly staining cells are present that exhibit all the characteristics of migrating neurons possessing a leading process oriented toward the Purkinje cell plate, a somatic cilium, and a close association with radial glia fibers. In later stages, these cells are also found deep to the Purkinje cell plate. Because Golgi cells arise during the period between E19 and postnatal day 2 in the rat (Altman and Bayer, &apos;77, '78) and as the basket cells, the first neurons of proven origin from the external granular layer, are not produced before the second postnatal day (Altman, '72), the earlier migrating neurons are presumed to be Golgi cells. 3) Available data from cell kinetic 3H-thymidine studies show that there is no unequivocal evidence for Golgi cell genesis from the ventricular neuroepithelium, because, at the time of Golgi cell birth, ventricular and external granular stem cell populations are proliferating, and with the present methods it is not possible to decide which of these are the precursors of Golgi cells. Thus, taken together, the findings of this study show that Golgi cells are more likely to arise from the external granular layer than from the ventricular neuroepithelium. This concept would unify cerebellar histogenesis by proposing that projection neurons arise from the ventricular neuroepithelium, whereas all interneurons of the <BrainRegion>cerebellar cortex</BrainRegion> are descendants of the external granular layer.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Transneuronal labeling from the rat distal colon: anatomic evidence for regulation of distal colon function by a pontine corticotropin-releasing factor system.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Neural circuits that are positioned to regulate rat distal colon function were identified by immunohistochemical detection of pseudorabies virus (PRV) and corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF). The distribution of pseudorabies virus(PRV) -immunoreactive neurons was examined in <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> and brain at increasing times (72-118 hours) after distal colon injection. At 72-80 hours, pseudorabies virus(PRV) -labeling was confined to the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>, in the <BrainRegion>parasympathetic preganglionic column in the lumbosacral spinal cord</BrainRegion> and in the <BrainRegion>intermediolateral column of the thoracic spinal cord</BrainRegion>. At longer survival times (88 hours), pseudorabies virus(PRV) -immunolabeled neurons in the <BrainRegion>lumbosacral spinal cord</BrainRegion> were also distributed in superficial layers of the <BrainRegion>dorsal horn</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>dorsal commissure</BrainRegion>, and around the <BrainRegion>central canal</BrainRegion>. Trans-synaptic labeling was identified in the <BrainRegion>medullary raphe nuclei</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>parapyramidal region</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>A5</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>Barrington&apos;s nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>A7</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>dorsal cap of the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus</BrainRegion> after longer survival times (88-91 hours). Substantial labeling of the <BrainRegion>locus coeruleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>forebrain regions</BrainRegion> occurred at later survival times (&amp;gt; or = 96 hours). In dual-labeled sections, corticotropin-releasing factor(CRF) terminal labeling surrounded pseudorabies virus(PRV) -labeled neurons in the <BrainRegion>parasympathetic preganglionic column of the lumbosacral spinal cord</BrainRegion>. Additionally, many neurons in <BrainRegion>Barrington&apos;s nucleus</BrainRegion>, but not other corticotropin-releasing factor(CRF) -containing nuclei, were double labeled for corticotropin-releasing factor(CRF) and pseudorabies virus(PRV) . These results, taken with previous studies, support a convergence in transneuronal labeling from different pelvic viscera that may be related to coordination of overall pelvic visceral functions. Importantly, they provide an anatomic substrate for an impact of corticotropin-releasing factor(CRF) from Barrington&apos;s nucleus in normal and pathophysiological functions of the distal colon.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Expression of SCG10 and stathmin proteins in the rat olfactory system during development and axonal regeneration.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The membrane-associated protein SCG10 is expressed specifically by neuronal cells. Recent experiments have suggested that it promotes neurite outgrowth by increasing microtubule dynamics in growth cones. SCG10 is related to the ubiquitous but neuron-enriched cytosolic protein stathmin. To better understand the role played by SCG10 and stathmin in vivo, we have analyzed the expression and localization of these proteins in both the <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> epithelium and the <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> in developing and adult rats, as well as in adult bulbectomized rats. The <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> epithelium is exceptional in that <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> receptor neurons constantly regenerate and reinnervate the <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> throughout animal life-span. SCG10 and stathmin expression in the olfactory receptor neurons was found to be regulated during embryonic and postnatal development and to correlate with neuronal maturation. Whereas SCG10 expression was restricted to immature olfactory receptor neurons (GAP-43-positive, olfactory marker protein-negative), stathmin was also expressed by the basal cells. In the <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> of postnatal and adult rats, a moderate to strong SCG10 immunoreactivity was present in the <BrainRegion>olfactory nerve</BrainRegion> layer, whereas no labeling was detected in the glomerular layer. <BrainRegion>Olfactory</BrainRegion> glomeruli also showed no apparent immunoreactivity for several cytoskeletal proteins such as tubulin and microtubule-associated proteins. In unilaterally bulbectomized rats, SCG10 and stathmin were seen to be up-regulated in the regenerating <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> epithelium at postsurgery stages corresponding to <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> axon regeneration. Our data strongly suggest that, in vivo, both SCG10 and stathmin may play a role in axonal outgrowth during ontogenesis as well as during axonal regeneration.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Spatial relationship between synapse loss and beta-amyloid deposition in Tg2576 mice.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Although there is evidence that beta-amyloid impairs synaptic function, the relationship between beta-amyloid and synapse loss is not well understood. In this study we assessed synapse density within the <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>entorhinal cortex</BrainRegion> of Tg2576 mice at 6-18 months of age using stereological methods at both the light and electron microscope levels. Under light microscopy we failed to find overall decreases in the density of synaptophysin-positive boutons in any brain areas selected, but bouton density was significantly decreased within 200 mum of compact beta-amyloid plaques in the outer molecular layer of the <BrainRegion>dentate gyrus</BrainRegion> and Layers II and III of the <BrainRegion>entorhinal cortex</BrainRegion> at 15-18 months of age in Tg 2576 mice. Under electron microscopy, we found overall decreases in synapse density in the outer molecular layer of the <BrainRegion>dentate gyrus</BrainRegion> at both 6-9 and 15-18 months of age, and in Layers II and III of the <BrainRegion>entorhinal cortex</BrainRegion> at 15-18 months of age in Tg 2576 mice. However, we did not find overall changes in synapse density in the <BrainRegion>stratum radiatum of the CA1 subfield</BrainRegion>. Furthermore, in the two former brain areas we found a correlation between lower synapse density and greater proximity to beta-amyloid plaques. These results provide the first quantitative morphological evidence at the ultrastructure level of a spatial relationship between beta-amyloid plaques and synapse loss within the <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>entorhinal cortex</BrainRegion> of Tg2576 mice.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Morphology of inspiratory neurons located in the <BrainRegion>ventrolateral nucleus of the tractus solitarius</BrainRegion> of the cat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The morphology of 11 <BrainRegion>dorsal respiratory group</BrainRegion> (DRG) inspiratory neurons located in the <BrainRegion>ventrolateral nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion> (vl-NTS) was studied using the technique of intracellular labeling with the enzyme horseradish peroxidase (HRP). Six of these cells were cut in the transverse plane and had a mean somal diameter of 30.4 micron, while five others sectioned in the horizontal plane had a mean of 38.2 micron. These neurons produced an average of 6.2 primary dendrites (range: 4-10), many of which projected rostrally or caudally up to 1.0 mm from the cell bodies. These dendrites were oriented along the longitudinal axis; they ran parallel and ventral to the tractus solitarius. In general, all dendrites possessed numerous spines and appendages. Many axons could be traced for considerable distances within the <BrainRegion>medulla</BrainRegion> (in one instance, up to 8 mm). These axons were last discerned in the <BrainRegion>contralateral ventral medulla</BrainRegion> rostral to the level of their cell bodies. The axons of three neurons bifurcated in the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral medulla</BrainRegion>; one branch remained ipsilateral and projected caudally, while the other crossed the midline. A small number of counterstained cells of size similar to or larger than the horseradish peroxidase(HRP) -stained neurons formed a column that constituted the <BrainRegion>ventrolateral nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion>(vl-NTS) . Based upon our observations of stained and counterstained cells, we conclude that the inspiratory neurons of the <BrainRegion>ventrolateral nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion>(vl-NTS) are few in number and represent a morphologically homogeneous population. The primary orientation of the dendritic arbors of <BrainRegion>ventrolateral nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion>(vl-NTS) inspiratory neurons appears to optimize the surface area available to receive synaptic contacts from sensory afferents emerging from the tractus solitarius.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>NCAM expression by subsets of taste cells is dependent upon innervation.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The expression of the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) and distinct carbohydrate groups by cells of the taste buds of the rat vallate papilla was investigated by immunohistochemical and biochemical techniques. We employed antibodies against 1) the extracellular (mAb 3F4) and cytoplasmic (mAb 5B8) portions of the neural cell adhesion molecule(NCAM) polypeptide, 2) the highly sialylated form of neural cell adhesion molecule(NCAM) (mAb 5A5), 3) carbohydrate epitopes associated with glycosylated neural cell adhesion molecule(NCAM) forms in the rat (mAb 2B8) or frog (mAb 9-OE) olfactory system, and also 4) the Lewisb blood group carbohydrate epitope (mAb CO431). neural cell adhesion molecule(NCAM) mRNA was demonstrated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in samples of the vallate papilla, suggesting the presence of neural cell adhesion molecule(NCAM) in cells of the taste buds. Antibodies against neural cell adhesion molecule(NCAM) (mAbs 3F4 and 5B8) recognized a subset (about 20%) of cells within the vallate taste buds; fibers of the <BrainRegion>glossopharyngeal nerve</BrainRegion>, including those innervating the gustatory epithelium, were neural cell adhesion molecule(NCAM) immunoreactive. Taste bud cells did not express polysialic acid (mAb 5A5), but mAb 5A5 immunoreactivity was observed on fibers of the <BrainRegion>IXth nerve</BrainRegion>, including a few that entered the taste buds. All or nearly all of the cells within the vallate taste buds were immunoreactive to mAb 2B8, whereas mAbs 9-OE and CO431 reacted with subsets of cells. The carbohydrates recognized by mAbs 2B8 and 9-OE were also abundantly expressed in the ducts and acini of the lingual salivary glands. Bilateral crush of the <BrainRegion>IXth nerve</BrainRegion> resulted in the loss of expression of all of these molecules from the gustatory epithelium. If cells of the taste bud express neural cell adhesion molecule(NCAM) during their final stage(s) of differentiation, then neural cell adhesion molecule(NCAM) could play a role(s) in the growth of gustatory axons toward their target epithelial cells and in the recognition between the nerve fibers and mature taste receptor cells, or among the taste bud cells themselves.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Induction of aberrant functional afferents to the chick <BrainRegion>cochlear nucleus</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Surgical extirpation of the otocyst on embryonic day (E) 3 in chick embryos prevents formation of the <BrainRegion>cochlear nerve</BrainRegion> and results in development of an aberrant axonal projection from the <BrainRegion>contralateral cochlear nucleus</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>nucleus magnocellularis</BrainRegion>, NM) to the deafferented <BrainRegion>NM</BrainRegion>. We have studied the morphology of this projection using horseradish peroxidase injections in <BrainRegion>NM</BrainRegion> axons and light and electron microscopy. The ability of the projection to activate its target neurons synaptically was assessed by means of extracellular microelectrode recording from in vitro preparations of the chick <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion>. The aberrant projection arises as a vertically directed branch from the contralaterally traveling <BrainRegion>NM</BrainRegion> axon at the <BrainRegion>medial border of nucleus laminaris</BrainRegion> (NL). This axonal branch forms boutonal endings that may terminate anywhere in <BrainRegion>NM</BrainRegion> but are most common in its ventral and medial regions. In our experiments, this projection is not seen on the unoperated side of experimental animals or in normal controls from E11 onward but is found on the operated sides of all experimental animals, including those with bilateral removal of the otocysts. The aberrant projection persists at least from E11 through hatching and has essentially identical features in unilaterally and bilaterally lesioned animals. The endings of the aberrant projection are boutonal in form and, in the electron microscope, exhibit all of the elements associated with normal synapses. Electrophysiological studies confirm that stimulation of the aberrant axons can elicit postsynaptic responses in <BrainRegion>NM</BrainRegion> and suggest that these synapses use an excitatory amino acid neurotransmitter.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Areal differences in the laminar distribution of <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> afferents in <BrainRegion>cortical fields of the insular, parietal and temporal regions</BrainRegion> of primates.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>A cytoarchitectonic parcellation has been made of the <BrainRegion>cortex of the insula</BrainRegion> and of the adjoining parts of the <BrainRegion>temporal and parietal lobes</BrainRegion> in rhesus and squirrel monkeys. In conjunction with this, the intracortical distribution of the thalamo-cortical fibers has been studied by the autoradiographic tracing technique. There is a systematic change in the density, laminar distribution and general character of the intracortical <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> afferent plexus which seems to follow, in particular, the progressive differentiation of <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> layering that occurs in moving from <BrainRegion>insular</BrainRegion> through granular to homotypical <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion>. In the <BrainRegion>dysgranular and granular insular areas</BrainRegion> in which <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> lamination is indistinct, the <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> plexus as demonstrated autoradiographically is sparse and extends through much of layers III and IV. In the <BrainRegion>granular cortex</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>areas 3b</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>AI</BrainRegion>), the <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> plexus is densest and coarsest; it fills all of layers IV and IIIB and extends into layer IIIA. In the &quot;second" and "third" sensory areas, such as the <BrainRegion>second somatic sensory</BrainRegion> and many of the <BrainRegion>auditory fields</BrainRegion>, the density of the plexus and its coarseness diminish slightly and the deeper half of layer IV becomes free of terminals. In the homotypical <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion>, the plexus becomes sparser, finer and strictly confined to layer IIIB. In many areas there are additional indications of <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> terminations in deeper layers. Where layers V and VI are not divided into sublaminae (e.g.,in <BrainRegion>areas 3b</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>AI</BrainRegion>) there is labeling of the superficial half of layer VI. Where layers V and VI become subdivided in the homotypical <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion>, the auditory and adjacent fields were only observed in cases in which the <BrainRegion>magnocellular nucleus of the medial geniculate body</BrainRegion> was involved by the injection of isotope. The boundaries of the <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> projection fields of individual <BrainRegion>thalamic nuclei</BrainRegion>, as determined autoradiographically, are remarkably sharp and invariably coincide with a sharp architectonic boundary or with a zone of maximal cytoarchitectonic change. Zones of apparent architectonic transition never showed overlap of <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> afferents emanating from more than one nucleus. These results raise for discussion the significance of architectonic structure in relation to <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> connectivity and have a bearing upon those studies that have attempted to relate the terminals of <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> afferents to particular classes of <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> neuron.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Ontogeny of NADPH diaphorase/nitric oxide synthase reactivity in the brain of Xenopus laevis.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The development of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) expression in the brain of Xenopus laevis tadpoles was studied by means of immunohistochemistry using specific antibodies against nitric oxide synthase(NOS) and enzyme histochemistry for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-diaphorase. Both techniques yielded identical results and were equally suitable for demonstrating the nitrergic system in the brain. The only mismatches were observed in the <BrainRegion>olfactory nerve</BrainRegion> and glomeruli and in the terminal nerve; they were intensely labeled with the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate(NADPH) -diaphorase technique but failed to stain with nitric oxide synthase(NOS) immunohistochemistry. As early as stage 33, nitrergic cells were observed in the <BrainRegion>caudal rhombencephalon</BrainRegion> within the developing <BrainRegion>inferior reticular nucleus</BrainRegion>. At later embryonic stages, different sets of <BrainRegion>reticular</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>tegmental</BrainRegion> neurons were labeled in the <BrainRegion>middle reticular nucleus</BrainRegion> and, more conspicuously, in the <BrainRegion>laterodorsal and pedunculopontine tegmental nuclei</BrainRegion>. As development proceeded, new nitrergic cell groups gradually appeared in the <BrainRegion>mesencephalon</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>diencephalon</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>telencephalon</BrainRegion>. A general caudorostral temporal sequence was observed, both in the whole brain and within each main brain subdivision. The premetamorphic period was mainly characterized by the maturation of the cell populations developed in the embryonic period. During prometamorphosis, the nitrergic system reached an enormous development, and many new cell groups were observed for the first time, in particular in the <BrainRegion>telencephalon</BrainRegion>. By the climax of metamorphosis, the pattern of organization of nitrergic cells and fibers observed in the brain was similar to that present in the adult brain. Transient expression of nitric oxide synthase(NOS) was not detected in any brain region. Our data suggest that nitric oxide plays an important role during brain development of Xenopus. Comparison with the developmental pattern of nitrergic systems in other vertebrates shows that amphibians possess more common features with amniotes than with anamniotes.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Transplantation of <BrainRegion>tectal tissue</BrainRegion> in rats. II. Distribution of host neurons which project to transplants.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText><BrainRegion>Tectal tissue</BrainRegion> was dissected from fetal rats and transplanted adjacent to the <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion> of newborn rats. The recipient animals were then allowed to survive for 6 or more weeks. Subsequent examination revealed that the transplants generally lay over the host <BrainRegion>inferior colliculus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>rostral part of the cerebellum</BrainRegion> and had substantial fiber connections with the host <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion>. To determine which host areas projected to the transplants, horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was injected into the transplants, and the host brain was examined for the presence of retrogradely filled neurons. Labeled cells were found in nearly 50 host areas. Most of these areas are known to project to normal <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion>. There was a consistency between one animal and another in the frequency and density of cell label in the various areas. The projection from host <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion> (particularly from <BrainRegion>visual cortical areas</BrainRegion>) was the densest and most consistent projection. Other areas which commonly projected into the transplants included <BrainRegion>pretectum</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>parabigeminal nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>brachial region of the inferior colliculus</BrainRegion>. Sparse and infrequent projections were found from <BrainRegion>ventral lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>substantia nigra</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>zona incerta</BrainRegion>, and catecholaminergic nuclei. No unequivocally labeled <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> ganglion cells were found. The results indicate that the host projection into the transplants is limited to those areas with axons in the vicinity of the host/transplant interconnection. However, the data also suggest that (1) the relative maturity of particular host pathways at the time of transplantation and (2) some form of preferential or absolute affinity expressed between host axons and transplant cells are also factors which influence the pattern of connections formed between host and transplant.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>&quot;Dormant basket cell" hypothesis revisited: relative vulnerabilities of <BrainRegion>dentate gyrus</BrainRegion> mossy cells and inhibitory interneurons after <BrainRegion>hippocampal</BrainRegion> status epilepticus in the rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The &quot;dormant basket cell" hypothesis suggests that postinjury <BrainRegion>hippocampal</BrainRegion> network hyperexcitability results from the loss of vulnerable neurons that normally excite insult-resistant inhibitory basket cells. We have reexamined the experimental basis of this hypothesis in light of reports that excitatory hilar mossy cells are not consistently vulnerable and inhibitory basket cells are not consistently seizure resistant. Prolonged afferent stimulation that reliably evoked granule cell discharges always produced extensive hilar neuron degeneration and immediate granule cell disinhibition. Conversely, kainic acid-induced status epilepticus in chronically implanted animals produced similarly extensive hilar cell loss and immediate granule cell disinhibition, but only when granule cells discharged continuously during status epilepticus. In both preparations, electron microscopy revealed degeneration of presynaptic terminals forming asymmetrical synapses in the mossy cell target zone, including some terminating on gamma-aminobutyric acid-immunoreactive elements, but no evidence of axosomatic or axoaxonic degeneration in the adjacent granule cell layer. Although parvalbumin immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization revealed decreased staining, this apparently was due to altered parvalbumin expression rather than basket cell death, because substance P receptor-positive interneurons, some of which contained residual parvalbumin immunoreactivity, survived. These results confirm the inherent vulnerability of dendritically projecting hilar mossy cells and interneurons and the relative resistance of <BrainRegion>dentate</BrainRegion> inhibitory basket and chandelier cells that target granule cell somata. The variability of <BrainRegion>hippocampal</BrainRegion> cell loss after status epilepticus suggests that altered <BrainRegion>hippocampal structure</BrainRegion> and function cannot be assumed to cause the spontaneous seizures that develop in these animals and highlights the importance of confirming <BrainRegion>hippocampal</BrainRegion> pathology and pathophysiology in vivo in each case.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<AbstractText>The <BrainRegion>frontal lobe</BrainRegion> connections of different architectonic areas of the <BrainRegion>superior temporal sulcus</BrainRegion> (STS) in the rhesus monkey were investigated with the aid of both anterograde and retrograde tracing techniques. The <BrainRegion>proisocortical area in the rostralmost superior temporal sulcus</BrainRegion>(STS) connects with <BrainRegion>proisocortical regions on the ventral and medial surfaces of the frontal lobe</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>frontal lobe</BrainRegion> projections of <BrainRegion>polymodal cortex</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>area TPO</BrainRegion>) in the upper bank of the <BrainRegion>superior temporal sulcus</BrainRegion>(STS) are organized according to the rostral-to-caudal topography of the sulcus. <BrainRegion>Rostral TPO</BrainRegion> interconnects with ventral (<BrainRegion>areas 13, 12, 11, and 14</BrainRegion>), medial (<BrainRegion>areas 24, 32, 14, and 9</BrainRegion>), and lateral (<BrainRegion>areas 10, 12, and 46</BrainRegion>) sectors of the <BrainRegion>frontal lobe</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>mid-portion of polymodal cortex</BrainRegion> projects to, and receives fibers from, <BrainRegion>rostral subdivisions of lateral prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion>, viz. <BrainRegion>dorsal area 46</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>areas 9 and 10</BrainRegion>, whereas the <BrainRegion>caudal segment of TPO</BrainRegion> has reciprocal connections with caudal subdivisions (<BrainRegion>areas 46, 8, and 6</BrainRegion>) of the <BrainRegion>lateral frontal lobe</BrainRegion>. Visual-related zones (<BrainRegion>areas TEa and TEm</BrainRegion>) in the rostral lower bank of the <BrainRegion>superior temporal sulcus</BrainRegion>(STS) have connectional relationships with <BrainRegion>orbitofrontal areas 11 and 12</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>lateral frontal areas 46 and 8</BrainRegion>.

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Retinogeniculate</BrainRegion> projection fibers in the monkey <BrainRegion>optic nerve</BrainRegion>: a demonstration of the fiber pathways by retrograde axonal transport of WGA-HRP.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Seven Japanese monkeys (Macaca fuscata) were used to investigate the fiber pathways of the <BrainRegion>optic nerve</BrainRegion>. <BrainRegion>Optic nerve</BrainRegion> fibers and <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> ganglion cells were retrogradely labeled by iontophoretic injections of wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) into electrophysiologically defined positions of the <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion> (LGN). By gross anatomical observation, the <BrainRegion>optic nerve</BrainRegion> usually had one distinct bend, which flexed dorsally 3-4 mm from the eyeball, and occasionally another ventrally directed bend was found just behind the eyeball. In the <BrainRegion>optic nerve</BrainRegion> head, fibers from the various <BrainRegion>retinal areas</BrainRegion> were arranged in a wedge according to the fiber trajectory on the <BrainRegion>retinal surface</BrainRegion>. For about a 3 mm distance from the disc, fibers rapidly spread out radially. Subsequently, rather than scattering dorsoventrally, they progressed to the <BrainRegion>chiasm</BrainRegion> with a gradual increase in the degree of mediolateral (nasotemporal) scatter. The degree of the scatter was different depending on the <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> site from which the axons originated. Fibers from the <BrainRegion>peripheral retina</BrainRegion> spread out widely for a few millimeters behind the eyeball. Thereafter the scatter was rather limited until the <BrainRegion>chiasm</BrainRegion>. On the other hand, the scatter of fibers from the <BrainRegion>foveal</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>parafoveal areas</BrainRegion> progressed gradually through the nerve. The present study also suggests that the difference in scatter depends on the types of cells of origin. Fibers from large ganglion cells displayed more extensive scatter than fibers from medium-sized cells. In spite of the extensive scatter of fibers, two clear segregations were found; one was a dorsoventral segregation, which was displayed by both <BrainRegion>central and peripheral retinal</BrainRegion> fibers, and the other was a center-peripheral segregation in which the fibers from the <BrainRegion>nasal central (papillomacular) retina</BrainRegion> were located almost exclusively in the <BrainRegion>central part of the optic nerve</BrainRegion> surrounded by <BrainRegion>peripheral retinal</BrainRegion> fibers. However, the <BrainRegion>temporal central retinal</BrainRegion> fibers were located in the lateral periphery of the nerve, and they overlapped significantly with fibers from the <BrainRegion>temporal peripheral retina</BrainRegion>. Furthermore, a broad intermingling was found between <BrainRegion>nasal and temporal peripheral retinal</BrainRegion> fibers owing to their mediolateral scatter. Thus, the present findings based on more precise anatomical techniques indicate that the classical notion of the <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> quadrant topography in the monkey <BrainRegion>optic nerve</BrainRegion> probably is suspect. In addition, the &quot;rotation" of the fiber arrangement was not demonstrated.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Diffuse distribution of sulforhodamine-labeled neurons during serotonin-evoked locomotion in the neonatal rat <BrainRegion>thoracolumbar spinal cord</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The fluorescent dye sulforhodamine-101 undergoes synaptic activity-dependent endocytotic uptake and consequent retrograde transport in presynaptic neurons. We used sulforhodamine to identify <BrainRegion>thoracolumbar spinal</BrainRegion> premotor neurons (T11-L6) activated during serotonin (5-HT) -induced hindlimb locomotor-like activity in the in vitro neonatal rat spinal cord preparation. Sulforhodamine labeling required locomotor-like activity because few neurons were labeled unless bath applied 5-HT recruited the locomotor rhythm. In contrast, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA; 5 microM) profoundly increased spinal neuronal labeling irrespective of locomotor activity. The contribution of false-positive activity labeling during locomotion induced by application of N-methyl-D-aspartate(NMDA) with 5-HT (Kjaerulff et al. [1994] J Physiol (Lond). 478:265-273) necessitated the present re-mapping of sulforhodamine-labeled neurons. During 5-HT-evoked locomotion, the sulforhodamine-labeled neurons were diffusely scattered within the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> with predominant labeling in lamina VII. Motor nuclei (lamina IX) and superficial laminae (I-II) were typically devoid of labeled cells in the isolated <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>. However, unilateral labeling of motoneurons was achieved when the ipsilateral hindlimb remained attached, suggesting that uptake in motoneurons requires an intact neuromuscular junction. The rostrocaudal incidence and distribution of labeled neurons was uniform in <BrainRegion>spinal segments</BrainRegion> L1-L5, with reduced numbers observed in thoracic and L6 <BrainRegion>spinal segments</BrainRegion>. Mean total cell labeling was less than 400 per <BrainRegion>spinal segment</BrainRegion>, suggesting recruitment from a very small fraction of the neurons contained within the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> (calculated at &amp;lt; 0.1%). These results are consistent with the limited transfer of locomotor-related synaptic activity (Raastad et al. [1996] Neuron 17:729-738) and severe synaptic fatigue (Lev-Tov and Pinco [1992] J Physiol. 447:149-169; Pinco and Lev-Tov [1993] J Neurophysiol. 70:1151-1158; Fleoter and Lev-Tov [1993] J Neurophysiol. 70:2241-2250) observed in the neonatal rat spinal cord.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Presynaptic metabotropic glutamate receptors in adult and developing neurons: autoexcitation in the <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The mitral cell of the <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> is the primary relay neuron that transmits information from the <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> receptors to the rest of the brain. This excitatory neuron releases glutamate from presynaptic dendrites and axon terminals. All rat mitral cells studied showed strong, selective, and widespread metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR1 alpha immunoreactivity on the presynaptic membrane of dendrites, often at the synaptic vesicle release site, when examined with light and electron microscopy. The finding of glutamate receptors on mitral cell secondary dendrites supports the conclusion that not all dendritic membrane with glutamate receptors necessarily have gray type I asymmetrical synaptic specializations. In contrast, the metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR5 was not found in mitral cells but was expressed by granule cells and astrocytes around mitral dendrites. Both mGluR1 alpha and mGluR5 were expressed early in development, with strong immunostaining present by postnatal day 1. MGluR1 alpha staining at birth mirrored the adult staining pattern. MGluR5 staining at birth showed different patterns of immunostaining than that found in the adult, particularly in the external plexiform layer. In vitro <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> neurons and their dendrites from embryonic day (E) 18 <BrainRegion>olfactory bulbs</BrainRegion> responded to t-ACPD and quisqualate, selective and nonselective metabotropic glutamate receptor agonists, and to several ionotropic glutamate agonists with increases in intracellular Ca2+ as studied with fura-2 digital imaging. These data indicate that the receptors were functionally active at an early stage of development. Application of the glutamate receptor blockers d-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (AP5) and 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline (CNQX) to E17 <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> neurons after only 4 days in vitro resulted in a dramatic decrease in Ca2+ levels in 70% of 128 cells tested, suggesting that embryonic neurons after a short time in vitro can actively secrete glutamate. The presence of glutamate receptors on the long mitral cell dendrite suggests that it would be able to respond to release of its own excitatory transmitter, probably at an early stage of development. In the probable absence of other excitatory input to the secondary mitral dendrites, it would be the only excitatory &quot;input." This autoexcitatory response would be modulated by release of GABA from olfactory interneurons occurring milliseconds after glutamate release induced by olfactory nerve activation. This novel type of neuronal microcircuitry would potentially amplify signal transmission and current spread along the long mitral dendrites and could play an important role in lateral inhibition of <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> neurons.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Comparative study of the spatial relationship between nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-diaphorase activity, serotonin immunoreactivity, and GYIRFamide immunoreactivity and the musculature of the adult liver fluke, Fasciola hepatica (Digenea, fasciolidae).</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>This is the first detailed description of the nitrergic nervous system in a fluke. In this study, the authors analysed the distribution of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-diaphorase (NADPH-d) reactivity in neuronal and nonneuronal tissues of the adult fluke Fasciola hepatica and compared this with the distribution of the musculature using tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-phalloidin. To assess the correlation between the number of muscle cells in different parts of the fluke and the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-diaphorase(NADPH-d) -stained cells, the nuclei were stained with Hoechst 333 42, which is specific for chromatin. The spatial relation between the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-diaphorase(NADPH-d) -positive nerves and the 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin; 5-HT)-immunoreactive (-IR) and GYIRFamide-IR nervous elements was also examined. The methods complement each other. nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-diaphorase(NADPH-d) -positive staining occurs in both in neuronal tissue and nonneuronal tissue. Large, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-diaphorase(NADPH-d) -stained neurones were localised in the nervous system. The oral and ventral suckers are innervated with many large nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-diaphorase(NADPH-d) -stained neurones. In addition, the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-diaphorase(NADPH-d) staining reaction follows closely the muscle fibres in both the suckers, in the body, and in the ducts of the reproductive organs. The presence of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-diaphorase(NADPH-d) activity along muscle fibres in F. hepatica and in other flatworms supports a possible myoinhibitory role for nitric oxide. Neuronal nitric oxide synthase in flatworms may form a novel drug target, which would facilitate the development of a novel anthelminthic.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Developmental study of the gene expression for alpha and gamma subunits of enolase in the rat brain by in situ hybridization histochemistry.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The gene expression for alpha and gamma subunits of enolase, a dimeric enzyme in the glycolytic pathway, was examined in the developing brain of rats by in situ hybridization. The expression for the gamma subunit of enolase was first detected in post-mitotic neurons settled in the mantle zone at E13, and it increased progressively until the adult stage. Expression signals for the alpha subunit were discerned in two discrete regions showing different developmental changes: the signals in the proliferative ventricular zone were intense at E13 and decreased and eventually disappeared around birth, whereas the signals in the mantle zone persisted until the adult stage. In the adult brain, mRNAs for the alpha and gamma subunits were expressed widely in neurons, resulting in almost similar temporal patterns in the brain except for the <BrainRegion>cerebellum</BrainRegion>. Expression levels of the alpha subunit in adult glial cells were below the detection threshold of the in situ hybridization analysis. These findings suggest that both alpha and gamma enolase subunits participate in energy production in neurons of the mature brain and that marked changes in the subunit composition of enolase occur according to both neuron type and maturation.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Three groups of cortico-geniculate neurons and their distribution in binocular and monocular segments of cat <BrainRegion>striate cortex</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Among 409 neurons recorded from binocular and monocular segments of the cat <BrainRegion>striate cortex</BrainRegion>, 91 were identified as cells (C-G cells) projecting to the <BrainRegion>dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion> (LGN) on the basis of antidromic activation from <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(LGN) and of histological localization of <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> layer VI. The axonal conduction velocity of these C-G cells was calculated from differences in latency between antidromic responses to electrical stimulation of <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(LGN) and the optic radiation. According to this velocity, 70 C-G cells from the binocular segment could be classified as fast (13--32 m/sec), intermediate (3.2--11 m/sec) and slow (0.3--1.6 m/sec) cells. The fast cells (47% of the total) were spontaneously active and had receptive fields of complex type. Histologically they were located mostly in the upper half of layer VI. The intermediate cells (31%) were mostly simple. The slow cells (21%) were completely silent, not driven by visual stimuli, and located mostly in the lower VI. From the <BrainRegion>monocular segment of the cortex</BrainRegion>, the intermediate cells could not be recorded, while the other two groups of cells were sampled with the same frequency as from the binocular segment. These findings suggest an existence of three functionally distinct groups of C-G cells and a possible participation of the intermediate cells in binocular vision.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Expression of calcium-binding proteins in the diencephalon of the lizard Psammodromus algirus.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>This work is a study of the distribution pattern of calbindin-D28k, calretinin, and parvalbumin in the <BrainRegion>diencephalic alar plate</BrainRegion> of a reptile, the lizard Psammodromus algirus, by using the prosomeric model (Puelles [1995] Brain Behav Evol 46:319-337), which divides the <BrainRegion>alar plate of the diencephalon</BrainRegion> into the caudorostrally arranged <BrainRegion>pretectum</BrainRegion> (p1), <BrainRegion>dorsal thalamus plus epithalamus</BrainRegion> (p2), and <BrainRegion>ventral thalamus</BrainRegion> (p3). Calbindin and calretinin are more extensively expressed in the <BrainRegion>dorsal thalamus</BrainRegion> than in the neighboring alar regions, and therefore these calcium-binding proteins are particularly suitable markers for delimiting the <BrainRegion>dorsal thalamus</BrainRegion>/<BrainRegion>epithalamus complex</BrainRegion> from the <BrainRegion>ventral thalamus</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>pretectum</BrainRegion>. Conversely, parvalbumin is more intensely expressed in the <BrainRegion>pretectum</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>ventral thalamus</BrainRegion> than in the <BrainRegion>dorsal thalamus</BrainRegion>/<BrainRegion>epithalamus complex</BrainRegion>. Within the <BrainRegion>dorsal thalamus</BrainRegion>, calcium-binding protein immunoreactivity reveals a three-tiered division. The <BrainRegion>pretectum</BrainRegion> displays the most intense expression of parvalbumin within the <BrainRegion>diencephalon</BrainRegion>. Virtually all nuclei in the three sectors of the <BrainRegion>pretectum</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>commissural</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>juxtacommissural</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>precommissural</BrainRegion>) present strong to moderate expression of parvalbumin. We compare the distribution of calcium-binding proteins in the diencephalon of Psammodromus with other vertebrates, with mammals in particular, and suggest that the middle and ventral tiers of the reptilian <BrainRegion>dorsal thalamus</BrainRegion> may be comparable to nonspecific or plurimodal <BrainRegion>posterior/intralaminar thalamic nuclei</BrainRegion> in mammals, on the basis of the calcium-binding protein expression patterns, as well as the hodological and embryological data in the literature.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Post-rolandic <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> projections of the <BrainRegion>superior temporal sulcus</BrainRegion> in the rhesus monkey.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The efferent connections of different cytoarchitectonic areas of the <BrainRegion>superior temporal sulcus</BrainRegion> (STS) in the rhesus monkey with <BrainRegion>parieto-temporo-occipital cortex</BrainRegion> were investigated using autoradiographic methods. Four rostral-to-caudal subdivisions of <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>area TPO</BrainRegion>) in the <BrainRegion>upper bank of the superior temporal sulcus</BrainRegion>(STS) have distinct projection patterns. Rostral sectors (<BrainRegion>areas TPO-1 and -2</BrainRegion>) project to the <BrainRegion>rostral superior temporal gyrus</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>areas Ts1, Ts2, and Ts3</BrainRegion>), <BrainRegion>insula of the Sylvian fissure</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>parahippocampal gyrus</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>perirhinal and prorhinal cortexes</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>areas TF, TH, and TL</BrainRegion>); caudal sectors (<BrainRegion>TPO-3 and -4</BrainRegion>) project to the <BrainRegion>caudal superior temporal gyrus</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>areas paAlt and Tpt</BrainRegion>), <BrainRegion>supratemporal plane</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>area paAc</BrainRegion>), <BrainRegion>circular sulcus of the Sylvian fissure</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>area reIt</BrainRegion>), as well as <BrainRegion>medial paralimbic</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>areas 23, 24</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>retrosplenial cortex</BrainRegion>) and extrastriate (<BrainRegion>areas 18 and 19</BrainRegion>) cortexes. <BrainRegion>Area TPO-1</BrainRegion> does not project to the <BrainRegion>parietal lobe</BrainRegion>; <BrainRegion>area TPO-2</BrainRegion> projects to the <BrainRegion>inferior parietal lobule</BrainRegion>; <BrainRegion>area TPO-3</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>lower bank of the intraparietal sulcus</BrainRegion> (IPS) (<BrainRegion>area POa</BrainRegion>); and <BrainRegion>area TPO-4</BrainRegion> to <BrainRegion>medial parietal cortex</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>area PGm</BrainRegion>). <BrainRegion>Vision-related cortex</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>area TEa</BrainRegion>) in the <BrainRegion>rostral lower bank of the superior temporal sulcus</BrainRegion>(STS) sends fibers to the <BrainRegion>rostral inferotemporal region</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>areas TE1, -2, and -3</BrainRegion>) and <BrainRegion>parahippocampal gyrus</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>perirhinal cortex</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>areas TF and TL</BrainRegion>). Visual zones in the caudal lower bank and depth of the sulcus (<BrainRegion>area OAa, or MT and FST</BrainRegion>) project to the <BrainRegion>caudal inferotemporal region</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>areas TE3 and TEO</BrainRegion>), <BrainRegion>lateral preoccipital region</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>area V4</BrainRegion>), and <BrainRegion>lower bank of the intraparietal sulcus</BrainRegion>(IPS) (<BrainRegion>area POa</BrainRegion>). A zone in the <BrainRegion>rostral depth of the superior temporal sulcus</BrainRegion>(STS) (<BrainRegion>area IPa</BrainRegion>) projects to the <BrainRegion>rostral inferotemporal region</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>parahippocampal gyrus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>insula of the Sylvian fissure</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>parietal operculum</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>lower rim of the intraparietal sulcus</BrainRegion>(IPS) (<BrainRegion>area PG</BrainRegion>). <BrainRegion>superior temporal sulcus</BrainRegion>(STS) projections to <BrainRegion>parieto-temporo-occipital cortex</BrainRegion> have &quot;feedforward," "feedbackward," and "side-to-side" laminar patterns of termination similar to those of other <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> sensory systems. The differential connectivity supports the cytoarchitectonic parcellation of the <BrainRegion>superior temporal sulcus</BrainRegion>(STS) and suggests functional heterogeneity.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Variability in tactile projection patterns to <BrainRegion>cerebellar folia crus IIA</BrainRegion> of the Norway rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Tactile responses in the granule cell layers of the <BrainRegion>cerebellar hemispheres</BrainRegion> of rats are topographically arranged as a series of patches each representing a different region of the body surface. Previous observations had suggested that patches representing specific body parts recur in similar folial positions in different individuals; however, these relationships were not quantified. In this study we make inter-animal comparisons of the detailed distribution of receptive fields in the granule cell layer of the <BrainRegion>crown of crus IIa</BrainRegion> by using physiological mapping techniques. The results suggest that maps from different individuals do, in fact, share several topological features. These include the regions of the body surface represented, the general proportions of these representations, the relative positions of patches representing the same body parts, and the organization of receptive fields within patches located in similar positions. The principal variability seen in these comparisons was in the detailed neighborhood relations between different patches. As a result of the analysis of the consistent and variable features of these maps, we propose and discuss a new role for these <BrainRegion>cerebellar regions</BrainRegion> in coordinating the acquisition of tactile sensory information.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Efferents from the <BrainRegion>lateral frontal cortex</BrainRegion> to <BrainRegion>spinomedullary</BrainRegion> target areas, <BrainRegion>trigeminal nuclei</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>spinally</BrainRegion> projecting <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion> regions in the hedgehog tenrec.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>This study was done in the Madagascan lesser hedgehog tenrec, an insectivore with a very poorly differentiated <BrainRegion>neocortex</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>cortical region</BrainRegion>, known to give rise to <BrainRegion>spinal</BrainRegion> projections, was injected with tracer, and the <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> efferents to <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> were analyzed. <BrainRegion>Bulbar reticular fields</BrainRegion>, in addition, were identified according to their cells of origin and the laterality of their <BrainRegion>spinal</BrainRegion> projections after injection of tracer. Only few <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> fibers could be traced from the <BrainRegion>bulbar pyramid</BrainRegion> into the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral spinal cord</BrainRegion>, particularly to the <BrainRegion>lateral funiculus</BrainRegion>. The projections to the <BrainRegion>dorsal column nuclei</BrainRegion> and the classical <BrainRegion>spinally</BrainRegion> projecting <BrainRegion>brainstem regions</BrainRegion> were also weak. Faint projections were demonstrated to the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the posterior commissure</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>nucleus of Darkschewitsch</BrainRegion>. In comparison to other mammals, there was no evidence that the contralateral cortico-bulbo-spinal pathway was strengthened, substituting for the almost non-existent contralateral corticospinal projection. Unlike the sensorimotor apparatus controlling limb and body movements, the <BrainRegion>brainstem regions</BrainRegion> controlling the head and neck received prominent <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> projections. Direct corticotrigeminal projections and indirect pathways were well represented. The projections to the <BrainRegion>trigeminal nuclei</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>lateral reticular fields</BrainRegion> were clearly bilateral; those to the <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion> were predominantly ipsilateral. The corticobulbar fibers left the pyramid along its entire extent; the <BrainRegion>principal trigeminal nucleus</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>dorsolateral pontine tegmentum</BrainRegion> were supplied by additional fibers of the <BrainRegion>corticotegmental</BrainRegion> tract. The <BrainRegion>lateral frontal cortex</BrainRegion> also projected densely to the <BrainRegion>dorsolateral hypothalamus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion>, and the adjacent <BrainRegion>mesencephalic tegmentum</BrainRegion>, components of the emotional motor system.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Development of the <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> in the clawed frog, Xenopus laevis: a morphological and quantitative analysis.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The relationship between <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> axons and the cells of the <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> during normal development was analyzed to determine whether <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> afferent axons could play a role in the induction of <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> formation. The morphology of the <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> in Xenopus larvae from stages 26 to 58 and in adult frogs was analyzed with light and electron microscopy. Axons were first observed beneath the basal lamina of the neural tube at stages 30 and 32; at stage 32, neurons in this area of the neural tube began to differentiate. Synapses of <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> axons onto young neuronal processes were observed as early as stages 36 and 38. By stage 44, all of the layers of the <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> were present. The basic structure of the mature form of the <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> was apparent as early as stage 48/49 and remained constant throughout late larval life and even into adulthood, with only the size increasing. To determine the numerical relationship between <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> axons from both main and <BrainRegion>vomeronasal</BrainRegion> epithelia and mitral/tufted cells in the <BrainRegion>main and accessory olfactory bulbs</BrainRegion>, a quantitative study was also performed in which the number of <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> axons and the number of mitral/tufted cells were estimated for larval stages (stages 50 to 58) and adults. The number of axons increased with stage, with a 16-fold increase between stage 58 and adulthood. The number of mitral/tufted cells increased with stage, with only a 2.3-fold increase between stage 58 and adults. There is a correlation between axon number and mitral/tufted cell number during larval development that is consistent with the hypothesis that <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> axons influence <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> development. The convergence ratio of <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> axons onto mitral/tufted cells was 5:1 in larvae and increased to 34:1 in adults; this increase probably results in increased <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> sensitivity in adult frogs.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Changes in tactile stimuli-induced behavior and c-Fos expression in the <BrainRegion>superficial dorsal horn</BrainRegion> and in <BrainRegion>parabrachial nuclei</BrainRegion> after sciatic nerve crush.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Neurons in the superficial laminae of the <BrainRegion>dorsal horn</BrainRegion> are dominated by input from peripheral nociceptors. Following peripheral nerve injury, low threshold mechanoreceptive Abeta-fibers sprout from their normal termination site in laminae III/IV into laminae I-II and this structural reorganization may contribute to neuropathic tactile pain hypersensitivity. We have now investigated whether a sciatic nerve crush injury alters the behavioral response in rats to tactile stimuli and whether this is associated with a change in the pattern of c-Fos expression in the <BrainRegion>dorsal horn</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>parabrachial area of the brainstem</BrainRegion>. Sciatic nerve crush resulted in a patchy but marked tactile allodynia manifesting first at 3 weeks and persisting for up to 52 weeks. C-Fos expression in the <BrainRegion>dorsal horn</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>parabrachial region</BrainRegion> was never observed on brushing the skin of the sciatic nerve territory in animals with intact nerves, but was found after sciatic nerve crush with peripheral regeneration. We conclude that after nerve injury, low threshold mechanoreceptor fibers may play a major role in producing pain-related behavior by activating normally nociceptive-specific regions of the central nervous system such as the superficial laminae of the <BrainRegion>dorsal horn</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>parabrachial area</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Posterior parietal cortex</BrainRegion> in rhesus monkey: II. Evidence for segregated corticocortical networks linking <BrainRegion>sensory and limbic areas</BrainRegion> with the <BrainRegion>frontal lobe</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>We have examined the circuitry connecting the <BrainRegion>posterior parietal cortex</BrainRegion> with the <BrainRegion>frontal lobe</BrainRegion> of rhesus monkeys. HRP-WGA and tritiated amino acids were injected into <BrainRegion>subdivisions 7m, 7a, 7b, and 7ip of the posterior parietal cortex</BrainRegion>, and anterograde and retrograde label was recorded within the <BrainRegion>frontal motor and association cortices</BrainRegion>. Our main finding is that each <BrainRegion>subdivision of parietal cortex</BrainRegion> is connected with a unique set of <BrainRegion>frontal areas</BrainRegion>. Thus, <BrainRegion>area 7m</BrainRegion>, on the <BrainRegion>medial parietal surface</BrainRegion>, is interconnected with the <BrainRegion>dorsal premotor cortex</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>supplementary motor area</BrainRegion>, including the <BrainRegion>supplementary eye field</BrainRegion>. Within the <BrainRegion>prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>area 7m</BrainRegion>&apos;s connections are with the <BrainRegion>rostral sector of the frontal eye field</BrainRegion> (FEF), the <BrainRegion>dorsal bank of the principal sulcus</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>anterior bank of the inferior arcuate sulcus</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>Walker&apos;s area 45</BrainRegion>). In contrast, <BrainRegion>area 7a</BrainRegion>, on the <BrainRegion>posterior parietal convexity</BrainRegion>, is not linked with <BrainRegion>premotor regions</BrainRegion> but is heavily interconnected with the <BrainRegion>rostral frontal eye field</BrainRegion>(FEF) in the <BrainRegion>anterior bank of the superior arcuate sulcus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>dorsolateral prefrontal convexity</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>rostral orbitofrontal cortex</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>area 45</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>fundus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>adjacent cortex of the dorsal and ventral banks of the principal sulcus</BrainRegion>. <BrainRegion>Area 7b</BrainRegion>, in the <BrainRegion>anterior part of the posterior parietal lobule</BrainRegion>, is interconnected with still a different set of <BrainRegion>frontal areas</BrainRegion>, which include the <BrainRegion>ventral premotor cortex</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>supplementary motor area</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>area 45</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>external part of the ventral bank of the principal sulcus</BrainRegion>. The prominent connections of <BrainRegion>area 7ip</BrainRegion>, in the <BrainRegion>posterior bank of the intraparietal sulcus</BrainRegion>, are with the <BrainRegion>supplementary eye field</BrainRegion> and restricted portions of the <BrainRegion>ventral premotor cortex</BrainRegion>, with a wide area of the <BrainRegion>frontal eye field</BrainRegion>(FEF) that includes both its rostral and caudal sectors, and with <BrainRegion>area 45</BrainRegion>. All <BrainRegion>frontoparietal</BrainRegion> connections are reciprocal, and although they are most prominent within a hemisphere, notable interhemispheric connections are also present. These findings provide a basis for a parcellation of the classically considered <BrainRegion>association cortex of the frontal lobe</BrainRegion>, particularly the <BrainRegion>cortex of the principal sulcus</BrainRegion>, into sectors defined by their specific connections with the <BrainRegion>posterior parietal subdivisions</BrainRegion>. Moreover, the present findings, together with those of a companion study (Cavada and Goldman-Rakic: J. Comp. Neurol. this issue) have allowed us to establish multiple linkages between <BrainRegion>frontal areas</BrainRegion> and specific <BrainRegion>limbic and sensory cortices</BrainRegion> through the <BrainRegion>posterior parietal cortex</BrainRegion>. The networks thus defined may form part of the neural substrate of parallel distributed processing in the <BrainRegion>cerebral cortex</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Neuron-to-astrocyte transition: phenotypic fluidity and the formation of hybrid asterons in differentiating neurospheres.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>To the extent that their fate choice and differentiation processes can be understood and manipulated, neural stem cells represent a promising therapeutic tool for a variety of neuropathologies. We have previously shown that mature astrocytes possess neural stem cell attributes, and can give rise to neurons through the formation of multipotent neurosphere clones. Here we show that relatively mature neurons generated from neurospheres derived from postnatal <BrainRegion>subependymal zone</BrainRegion> or <BrainRegion>cerebellar cortex</BrainRegion> undergo a phenotypic transformation into astrocytes that coincides with the appearance of a nonfused, hybrid cell type that shares the morphology, antigenicity, and physiology of both neurons and astrocytes. We refer to this astrocyte/neuron hybrid as an &quot;asteron," and hypothesize that it represents an intermediate step in the trans- or dedifferentiation of neurons into astrocytes. The present finding suggests that seemingly terminally differentiated neural cells may in fact represent points along a bidirectionally fluid continuum of differentiation, with intermediate points represented by "hybrid" cells coexpressing phenotypic markers of more than one lineage.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Distribution of <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion> projections from <BrainRegion>spinal</BrainRegion> lamina I neurons in the cat and the monkey.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The distribution of terminal projections in the <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion> from lamina I neurons in the <BrainRegion>spinal dorsal horn</BrainRegion> was investigated with the anterograde tracer Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin in the cat and the cynomolgus monkey. Iontophoretic injections made with physiological guidance were restricted to lamina I or to laminae I-III in the cervical (C6-8) or lumbar (L6-7) enlargement. The distribution of terminal labeling was essentially identical in the cat and the monkey, although consistently of greater intensity in the monkey. Terminations were observed in the <BrainRegion>solitary nucleus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>dorsomedial medullary reticular formation</BrainRegion>, the entire rostrocaudal extent of the <BrainRegion>ventrolateral medulla</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>locus coeruleus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>subcoerulear region</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>Kölliker-Fuse nucleus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>lateral and medial portions of the parabrachial nucleus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>cuneiform nucleus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>ventrolateral and lateral portions of the periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>intercollicular nucleus</BrainRegion>. Lamina I terminations were generally bilateral in the <BrainRegion>medulla</BrainRegion> but more dense contralaterally in the <BrainRegion>pons</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>mesencephalon</BrainRegion>. The density and laterality of labeling in the <BrainRegion>medulla</BrainRegion> varied between cases independently from that in the <BrainRegion>pons</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>mesencephalon</BrainRegion>, suggesting that the lamina I projections to these regions may originate from different subsets of neurons. A clear topographic organization was observed only in the <BrainRegion>lateral column of the periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion>, where lumbar lamina I terminations were found caudal to cervical terminations. These observations indicate that <BrainRegion>spinal</BrainRegion> lamina I neurons project to a variety of <BrainRegion>brainstem sites</BrainRegion> involved in autonomic (cardiovascular, respiratory) and homeostatic processing and the control of behavioral state. These projections provide an afferent substrate for spino-bulbo-spinal somatoautonomic reflex arcs activated by nociceptive, thermoreceptive activity and for a spino-bulbo-hypothalamic relay of such activity by cells in the <BrainRegion>caudal ventrolateral medulla</BrainRegion>. These observations support the general concept that lamina I projections distribute modality-selective sensory information relevant to the physiological status and maintenance of the tissues and organs of the entire organism.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Nerve cell atrophy and loss in the <BrainRegion>inferior olivary complex</BrainRegion> of &quot;Purkinje cell degeneration" mutant mice.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The genetically determined loss of <BrainRegion>cerebellar</BrainRegion> Purkinje cells (PCs) in &quot;Purkinje cell degeneration" (pcd) mutant mice deprives <BrainRegion>inferior olivary</BrainRegion> (IO) neurons of their major postsynaptic target. The degeneration of Purkinje cells(PCs) starts on postnatal day (P) 17 and loss of these neurons is virtually complete by P45. We examined the <BrainRegion>inferior olivary complex</BrainRegion> ( inferior olivary(IO) C) of normal and &quot;Purkinje cell degeneration"(pcd) mutant mice by quantitative light microscopy to determine whether the degeneration of Purkinje cells(PCs) is associated with atrophy and loss of their presynaptic neurons in the <BrainRegion>inferior olivary</BrainRegion>(IO) C. The number of <BrainRegion>inferior olivary</BrainRegion>(IO) neurons in 17-day-old mutants did not differ significantly from controls (P greater than .1). <BrainRegion>inferior olivary</BrainRegion>(IO) neurons in 23-day-old mutants were 23% (95% confidence limits: 12-34%) fewer than in age-matched controls, and in 300-day-old mutants they were 48% (95% confidence limits: 37-58%) fewer than in their controls (P less than .001 in both cases). The decline of the number of <BrainRegion>inferior olivary</BrainRegion>(IO) neurons in &quot;Purkinje cell degeneration"(pcd) mice between days 17 and 300 was 49% (P less than .0001; 95% confidence limits: 38-57%). The <BrainRegion>medial accessory olive</BrainRegion> (MAO) appeared less affected than the <BrainRegion>principal (PO) and the dorsal accessory olive</BrainRegion> (DAO). The mean neuronal diameter in control mice was 11.6 micron at 23 days and 10.8 micron at 300 days of age. The respective values in &quot;Purkinje cell degeneration"(pcd) mutants were 11.5 micron and 8.7 micron. Diameters in old mutants were significantly smaller than those in both age-matched controls and young mutants (P less than .001). These findings suggest that in the mature olivocerebellar system the stability of <BrainRegion>inferior olivary</BrainRegion>(IO) neurons depends on the state of their postsynaptic Purkinje cells(PCs) .</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Musculotopic organization of the <BrainRegion>hypoglossal nucleus</BrainRegion> in the cynomolgus monkey, Macaca fascicularis.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The movements of the tongue in feeding and vocalization are enabled by a complex system of interdigitated muscle fibers in the tongue body. Because of this complexity, the detailed anatomical connections between individual intrinsic tongue muscles and corresponding motoneurons in the <BrainRegion>hypoglossal nucleus</BrainRegion> have not been described for any mammal. In this study we describe the distribution of retrogradely labeled neurons in the <BrainRegion>hypoglossal nucleus</BrainRegion>, following injections of wheat-germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase into different regions of the tongue of 21 cynomolgus monkeys. These experiments demonstrate a spatial organization of hypoglossal motoneurons that reflects the anatomical and functional organization of tongue body muscles: motoneurons innervating the transversus and verticalis muscles are located in <BrainRegion>medial hypoglossal nucleus regions</BrainRegion>, motoneurons innervating the genioglossus are located in <BrainRegion>intermediate hypoglossal nucleus regions</BrainRegion>, motoneurons innervating the hyoglossus and inferior longitudinalis are located in <BrainRegion>ventrolateral hypoglossal nucleus regions</BrainRegion>, and motoneurons innervating the styloglossus and superior longitudinalis are located in <BrainRegion>dorsolateral hypoglossal nucleus regions</BrainRegion>. Motoneurons innervating the suprahyoid muscle, the geniohyoid, are situated in a cell column separated ventrally from the main body of the <BrainRegion>hypoglossal nucleus</BrainRegion>. Motoneurons innervating the palatoglossus are located in the <BrainRegion>nucleus ambiguus</BrainRegion> and, possibly, in <BrainRegion>dorsolateral hypoglossal nucleus regions</BrainRegion>. Motoneurons of the <BrainRegion>medial divisions of the hypoglossal nucleus</BrainRegion> innervate tongue muscles that are oriented in planes transverse to the long axis of the tongue whereas motoneurons of the lateral divisions innervate tongue muscles that are oriented parallel to this axis. These results suggest that the segregation of motoneurons corresponds to the functional distinction between tongue protrusion and retrusion.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Long-term survival of centrally projecting axons in the <BrainRegion>optic nerve</BrainRegion> of the frog following destruction of the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>A significant number of unmyelinated axons and their synaptic endings in the frog, Rana pipiens, were found to retain a normal morphology long after separation from their cell bodies. At the end of various survival periods following unilateral removal of the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>, horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was administered to the <BrainRegion>optic nerve</BrainRegion> stump by a fiber-filling method. In frogs maintained at 20 degrees C, unmyelinated <BrainRegion>optic nerve</BrainRegion> axons conducted horseradish peroxidase(HRP) from the site of application in the orbit to layers A, C, and E of the <BrainRegion>contralateral optic tectum</BrainRegion>, even though their <BrainRegion>retinas</BrainRegion> had been removed up to 69 days earlier. Such fiber-filling was absent beyond 19 days in other frogs surviving at 35 degrees C. No labeled fibers were continuous  with any intracerebral neurons. The horseradish peroxidase(HRP) was always localized intraaxonally, and the marked axons and terminals were ultrastructurally normal. Counts of surviving axons from electron micrographs of the <BrainRegion>optic nerves</BrainRegion> showed that, at 20 degrees C, more than half of the normal complement of unmyelinated axons disappeared in the first 10 days. All the myelinated axons degenerated during the first 6 weeks survival. However, approximately 55,000 normal-appearing unmyelinated axons (12% of the unmyelinated fiber population) persisted in the <BrainRegion>optic nerve</BrainRegion> at 10 weeks following removal of the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>. The survival rate was lower at 35 degrees C. In other frogs, one eye was injected with 3H-leucine to initiate axonal transport into the <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> ganglion cell axons. That eye was removed 48 hours later. Autoradiographic analysis of brain sections of frog surviving an additional 31 to 61 days at 20 degrees C showed strong labeling of the optic tract and layers A, C, and E of the <BrainRegion>contralateral optic tectum</BrainRegion>. The absence of displaced ganglion cells that might exist within the <BrainRegion>optic nerve</BrainRegion> was verified by other observations. It is hypothesized that the potential shown by frog <BrainRegion>optic</BrainRegion> axons for long-term survival in the absence of the cell-body expresses a general property of vertebrate (and invertebrate) axons, rather than a special property of the frog <BrainRegion>optic nerve</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Development of the rat <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion>: I. Mosaic organization of the <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> neuroepithelium.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Short-survival, sequential, and long-survival thymidine radiograms of rat embryos, fetuses and young pups were analyzed in order to delineate the boundaries of the proliferative <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> neuroepithelium, describe its early transformations, identify its regional divisions, and, finally, attempt to relate its distinct neuroepithelial components to specific <BrainRegion>thalamic nuclei</BrainRegion> that they supply with neurons. On day E13 the <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> neuroepithelium consists of two divisions, the <BrainRegion>rostral lobe</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>caudal lobe</BrainRegion>, and interposed between the two is a small transient structure, the <BrainRegion>reticular protuberance</BrainRegion>. By day E14 the <BrainRegion>rostral lobe</BrainRegion> has become partitioned into the <BrainRegion>anterior lobule</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>reticular lobule</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>caudal lobe</BrainRegion> into the <BrainRegion>intermediate lobule</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>posterior lobule</BrainRegion>. By day E15 these four lobules have become further partitioned into sublobules, characterized as regional eversions and inversions (concavities and convexities) of the <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> neuroepithelium. Several of these sublobules are still recognizable on day E16 but progressively disappear thereafter. In this introductory paper, some evidence is presented in support of the hypothesis that the identified <BrainRegion>thalamic sublobules</BrainRegion> represent putative cell lines committed to produce neurons for specific, early-generated <BrainRegion>thalamic nuclei</BrainRegion>. Detailed documentation of the evidence on which the identifications are based is provided in subsequent papers of this series which deal with the early development of specific <BrainRegion>thalamic regions and nuclei</BrainRegion>. In our attempt to identify these putative cell lines, we sought to meet the following criteria: (1) a good match between the time course of mitotic activity in a neuroepithelial sublobule and the birth days of neurons in the nucleus that it is postulated to supply with neurons, (2) relative proximity between the putative neuroepithelial source and the <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> target structure, and, where possible, (3) the tracing of migrating cells from the germinal source to its destination. Using these criteria we have made the following tentative identifications. The early derivatives of the <BrainRegion>anterior thalamic lobules</BrainRegion> are the <BrainRegion>sublobules (committed cell lines) of the anterior thalamic nuclei</BrainRegion>, and of the <BrainRegion>central lateral and mediodorsal nuclei</BrainRegion>. The early derivatives of the <BrainRegion>reticular lobule</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>reticular protuberance are the sublobules of the reticular nuclear complex</BrainRegion>. The early derivatives of the <BrainRegion>intermediate lobule</BrainRegion> are the <BrainRegion>sublobules of the ventrolateral and ventrobasal nuclei</BrainRegion>. Finally, the early derivatives of the <BrainRegion>posterior lobule</BrainRegion> are the <BrainRegion>sublobules of the dorsal geniculate</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>ventral geniculate</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>medial geniculate nuclei</BrainRegion>.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Topographic organization of the central projections of the <BrainRegion>spiral ganglion</BrainRegion> in cats.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The morphological organization of inputs from restricted sectors of the cat <BrainRegion>cochlear spiral ganglion</BrainRegion> into the <BrainRegion>cochlear nucleus</BrainRegion> was studied by making focal extracellular injections of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) into the <BrainRegion>spiral ganglion</BrainRegion>. Injections resulted in Golgi-like labeling of a small cluster of <BrainRegion>spiral ganglion</BrainRegion> cells and their peripheral and central axons. Large injections involved most of the cells within Rosenthal&apos;s canal in sectors of the <BrainRegion>spiral ganglion</BrainRegion> innervating greater than or equal to 1 mm of the <BrainRegion>basilar membrane</BrainRegion> and resulted in narrow, complete laminae of labeled axons and preterminal fields within each <BrainRegion>cochlear nucleus subdivision</BrainRegion>. The positions of these bands were consistent with the &quot;isofrequency laminae" appropriate for the frequencies represented at the injection sites, with high frequency laminae situated more dorsally, and lower frequencies progressively more ventral. A discrete projection to the small cell cap area was observed that was discontinuous with the main projection laminae in the <BrainRegion>ventral cochlear nuclei</BrainRegion> (VCN). In the <BrainRegion>dorsal cochlear nucleus</BrainRegion>, projecting fibers and terminals were excluded from the molecular cell layer. No labeled fibers entered the granule cell areas. In contrast to larger injections, very small horseradish peroxidase(HRP) deposits labeled only part of an isofrequency lamina. Specifically, injections restricted to the <BrainRegion>scala tympani</BrainRegion> aspect of the <BrainRegion>spiral ganglion</BrainRegion> labeled only the <BrainRegion>lateral part of ventral cochlear nuclei</BrainRegion>(VCN) isofrequency laminae, whereas injections limited to the <BrainRegion>scala vestibuli</BrainRegion> aspect of the ganglion labeled the medial aspect of the isofrequency planes. Thus these data indicate a previously unrecognized topographic representation of the vertical dimension of the <BrainRegion>spiral ganglion</BrainRegion> across <BrainRegion>ventral cochlear nuclei</BrainRegion>(VCN) isofrequency laminae. Some possible functional implications of this projection organization are discussed.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Hippocampal</BrainRegion> afferents to the rat <BrainRegion>prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion>: synaptic targets and relation to dopamine terminals.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Afferents to the <BrainRegion>prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion> (PFC) from the <BrainRegion>hippocampal formation</BrainRegion> and from <BrainRegion>midbrain</BrainRegion> dopamine (DA) neurons have been implicated in the cognitive and adaptive functions of this <BrainRegion>cortical region</BrainRegion>. In the present study, we investigated the ultrastructure and synaptic targets of <BrainRegion>hippocampal</BrainRegion> terminals, as well as their relation to dopamine(DA) terminals within the <BrainRegion>prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion>(PFC) of adult rats. <BrainRegion>Hippocampal</BrainRegion> afferents were labeled either by anterograde transport of wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) from the <BrainRegion>ventral hippocampal formation</BrainRegion> or by anterograde degeneration following fimbria lesion. <BrainRegion>Hippocampal</BrainRegion> terminals in the <BrainRegion>prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion>(PFC) , identified by either method, formed primarily asymmetric axospinous synapses, with a small percentage forming asymmetric axodendritic synapses. Dopamine terminals in the <BrainRegion>prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion>(PFC) were identified by peroxidase immunocytochemistry for either tyrosine hydroxylase or dopamine(DA) and formed primarily symmetric synapses onto dendritic spines and small caliber dendritic shafts. Spines that received symmetric synaptic contact from dopamine(DA) terminals invariably also received an asymmetric synapse from an unlabeled terminal, forming a triadic complex. <BrainRegion>Hippocampal</BrainRegion> and dopamine(DA) terminals in the <BrainRegion>prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion>(PFC) were not often observed in the same area of the neuropil, and no examples of convergence of <BrainRegion>hippocampal</BrainRegion> and dopamine(DA) terminals onto common postsynaptic targets were observed. Further analysis revealed that spines receiving synaptic contact from <BrainRegion>hippocampal</BrainRegion> terminals did not receive additional synaptic contact from any other source. However, when localized to the same area of the neuropil, <BrainRegion>hippocampal</BrainRegion> and dopamine(DA) terminals were often in direct apposition to one another, without forming axo-axonic synapses. These results suggest that 1) <BrainRegion>hippocampal</BrainRegion> terminals primarily form excitatory synapses onto spiny pyramidal neurons, 2) <BrainRegion>hippocampal</BrainRegion> afferents are unlikely to be synaptically modulated by dopamine(DA) or non- dopamine(DA) terminals at the level of the dendritic spine, and 3) appositions between <BrainRegion>hippocampal</BrainRegion> and dopamine(DA) terminals may facilitate presynaptic interactions between these afferents to the <BrainRegion>prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion>(PFC) .</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>The combined effects of unilateral enucleation and rearing in a &quot;dim" red light on synapse-to-neuron ratios in the rat <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Rats whose right eyes were enucleated on day 1 after birth and nonenucleated rats were raised in either &quot;light" or "dark" (red light) conditions from birth until 39 days of age. This resulted in 4 groups of animals: light-reared nonenucleated, light-reared enucleated, dark-reared nonenucleated, and dark-reared enucleated. At 39 days of age, the animals were killed by perfusion with 2.5% sodium cacodylate buffered glutaraldehyde. The <BrainRegion>superior colliculi</BrainRegion> were dissected out and processed for embedding in resin. Stereological procedures at the light and electron microscopical levels were used to estimate the synapse-to-neuron ratios in the superficial layers of these <BrainRegion>colliculi</BrainRegion>. Light-reared, nonenucleated rats had about 1,850 synapses-per-neuron in both the <BrainRegion>right and left superior colliculi</BrainRegion>. Rearing nonenucleated rats in the dark reduced this value to about 1,200. Enucleated rats reared in the light showed a differential response in the 2 <BrainRegion>colliculi</BrainRegion>. Thus, the contralateral (to the enucleated eye) <BrainRegion>colliculi</BrainRegion> showed a decrease, whereas the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral colliculi</BrainRegion> showed an increase in the synapse-to-neuron ratio compared with light-reared, nonenucleated rats. When enucleated rats were reared in the raised in either &quot;light" or "dark"(red light) , there was a decrease in the ratio in both <BrainRegion>colliculi</BrainRegion>, although the extent of this decrease was more marked in the contralateral than the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral colliculi</BrainRegion>. However, the decrease in the <BrainRegion>contralateral colliculi</BrainRegion> was not significantly greater than that observed in the corresponding colliculi from dark-reared, nonenucleated rats. These results provide useful information on the combined and separate effects of unilateral enucleation at around birth and dark ( raised in either &quot;light" or "dark"(red light) ) rearing during early life on the interneuronal connectivity of both the <BrainRegion>ipsi- and contralateral superior colliculi</BrainRegion> of rats. They also show the vast importance of visual stimulation for the normal development of the <BrainRegion>subcortical visual centers</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>The emergence, localization and maturation of neurotransmitter systems during development of the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> in Xenopus laevis. I. Gamma aminobutyric acid.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The high-affinity uptake, biosynthesis and release of GABA have been studied in the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> of Xenopus laevis. In the mature <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>, [3H]-GABA is accumulated predominantly by horizontal cells. A second population of cells located in the inner nuclear layer (possibly a type of amacrine cell) also showed a specific GABA uptake. In addition, this <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> contains significant activities of L-glutamic acid decarboxylase and also releases [3H]-GABA in response to increasing K+ concentrations in the medium. We have followed the appearance and maturation of these GABA-ergic properties during embryonic development of this <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>. Our results indicate that these properties emerge in a precise temporal pattern during <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> differentiation: the specific neuronal uptake of GABA precedes GABA synthesis which is followed by K+-stimulated GABA release.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Ovarian steroids influence cell proliferation in the <BrainRegion>dentate gyrus</BrainRegion> of the adult female rat in a dose- and time-dependent manner.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>In previous work, we have demonstrated that cell proliferation in the adult <BrainRegion>hippocampal formation</BrainRegion> is regulated by estrogen under both natural and experimental conditions. To determine the extent to which this regulation is affected by the dose or schedule of hormone treatment, or progesterone administration, we examined the impact of different acute and chronic ovarian hormone replacement regimens on cell production using the S-phase marker bromodeoxyuridine. Additionally, we investigated the long-term impact of surgical ovarian hormone depletion on the capacity of estrogen to stimulate cell proliferation and the production of new cells that express either TuJ1 (a marker of neuronal phenotype) or glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; a marker of astroglial phenotype). Acute treatment with a moderate, but not a low or a high, dose of estrogen rapidly increased cell proliferation in ovariectomized (OVX) animals, an effect that was reversed by the administration of progesterone. In contrast, OVX animals that were chronically replaced with either estrogen alone (continuous or cyclic) or estrogen plus progesterone (cyclic) did not exhibit an estrogen-induced increase in cell proliferation 3 weeks following the onset of hormone replacement. In animals that were subjected to a prolonged absence of ovarian hormones, acute treatment with the moderate dose of estrogen failed to stimulate cell proliferation, and a decrease in the number of new cells expressing a neuronal phenotype was evident. Collectively, these results indicate that a prolonged reduction in ovarian hormones results in 1) a diminished responsiveness to estrogen over time in this system and 2) a decrease in neuron production that is unlikely to be reversible by standard regimens of hormone replacement.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Developmental changes in <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> projections revealed by degeneration argyrophilia.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The maturation of the <BrainRegion>main and accessory olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> projections to the <BrainRegion>ventral forebrain</BrainRegion> of the golden hamster has been traced by using the Fink-Heimer silver technique to stain degenerating axons and terminal arborizations after bulbectomy at different ages between birth and 33 days. In the youngest pups, long-lasting degeneration argyrophilia (LLDA) is found in two regions of <BrainRegion>prepiriform cortex</BrainRegion>: at the level of the <BrainRegion>rostral tubercle</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>rostral amygdala</BrainRegion>. By five days of age the caudal region exhibiting a long-lasting degeneration reaction extends from the middle of the <BrainRegion>olfactory tubercle</BrainRegion> to the middle of the <BrainRegion>amygdala</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>olfactory tubercle</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>medial and cortical amygdala</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>entorhinal cortex</BrainRegion> subsequently develop substantial long-lasting degeneration argyrophilia(LLDA) at ages varying between 9 and 13 days. In a previous study (Leonard, &apos;74b) the onset of long-lasting degeneration argyrophilia(LLDA) in optic tract terminals in the <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion> was found to coincide with the age of eye opening and the onset of a stage of rapid snyapse formation. Since different <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> responses appear at different times during the golden hamster pup&apos;s first two weeks of postnatal life, it seems possible that the onset of long-lasting degeneration argyrophilia(LLDA) in different regions of the <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> projection at different ages may be related to the onset of different specific <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> functions.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>A study of <BrainRegion>cochlear</BrainRegion> innervation patterns in cats and rats with the Golgi method and Nomarkski Optics.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText><BrainRegion>Cochlear</BrainRegion> innervation patterns were studied in infant cats and rats with the rapid Golgi method. Examination of thick serial sections and surface preparations with the differential interference contrast microscope (Nomarski optics) allowed direct visualization of individually impregnated <BrainRegion>spiral ganglion</BrainRegion> cells, complete with their peripheral processes and endings in the <BrainRegion>organ of Corti</BrainRegion>. Individually impregnated efferent fibers could  be recognized as heavily varicose axons that project radially to endings beneath inner and outer hair cells after taking a tangential course in the intraganglionic spiral bundle. It was often possible to visualize unimpregnated hair cells in contact with the impregnated endings of both types of fibers. There are at least two types of <BrainRegion>spiral ganglion</BrainRegion> cells in the <BrainRegion>cochlea</BrainRegion> of the infant cat and rat. One type innervates only inner hair cells by means of radial fibers. These ganglion cells constitute the overwhelming majority of ganglion cells impregnated in our preparations, and each cell typically innervates two inner hair cells. Hence, these ganglion cells establish nearly &quot;point-to-point" connections between the <BrainRegion>auditory nerve</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>organ of Corti</BrainRegion>. The other type of ganglion cell innervates  outer hair cells by means of long spiral fibers; each cell typically innervates many outer hair cells through the numerous angular enlargements and short end branches of its spiral fiber. In addition, a few of these spiral fibers also send branches to inner hair cells by means of short collaterals; it remains to be seen if such fibers also occur in mature <BrainRegion>cochleas</BrainRegion>. Efferent fibers have been traced to inner and outer hair cell regions. The simplest pattern is formed by fine beaded axons with only a few branches ending mainly beneath inner hair cells. More complex patterns are formed by larger axons with many branches ending beneath inner or outer hair cells. Many efferent fibers send branches to both inner and outer hair cells. Electrophysiological studies so far have not demonstrated different populations of units that clearly correspond to the spiral and radial fibers. Therefore, the physilogical differences between inner and outer hair cell innervation remain undefined.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Ultrastructural features of functionally identified primary afferent neurons with C (unmyelinated) fibers of the guinea pig: classification of dorsal root ganglion cell type with reference to sensory modality.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Intracellular labeling of neurons permitted a direct correlation of neuronal profiles with sensory modality of cutaneous receptors. In the guinea pig, 47 neurons in the dorsal root ganglion (displaying C-fiber conduction velocities) were labeled with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) by iontophoresis after determining the sensory modality. Receptive field were explored with systematic &quot;natural" stimuli. Cell areas of all C-fiber units were measured by tracing the cellular contour in light microscopy. The mean cellular diameter calculated from cell areas was 21.8 microns in the second cervical ganglion of the guinea pig. Mean cell diameter for high-threshold mechanoreceptors was 20.9 microns, 24.6 microns for polymodal nociceptors, and 25.7 microns for mechanical-cold nociceptors. Electron microscopic observations showed that all labeled neurons of C-fiber units had profiles of small, dark type-B neurons. Neurons representative of each sensory modality exhibited different cell features, each belonging to a distinct subtype of small B neurons. High-threshold mechanoreceptor and mechanical-cold nociceptor displayed a peripheral lamellar arrangement of cisternae of endoplasmic reticulum (ER), corresponding to the B1 subtype. Polymodal nociceptor units were characteristically of the B2 subtype, in which stacks of long and short cisternae of endoplasmic reticulum(ER) were distributed randomly throughout the cytoplasm, and the arrangement of Golgi bodies varied among these cells. Cooling receptors displayed poorly developed, flattened cisternae of endoplasmic reticulum(ER) and numerous vesicles, typical of the B3 subtype. These results imply that all C-fiber cells belong to the small B-type cell category and that the ultrastructural features of the neuron in the dorsal root ganglion may reflect the sensory modality of the receptive field.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Visceral region in the rat <BrainRegion>primary somatosensory cortex</BrainRegion> identified by vagal evoked potential.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Recent noninvasive human studies have reconfirmed the presence of a viscerally responsive region in the <BrainRegion>most lateral part of the primary somatosensory cortex</BrainRegion> (S1). The present electrophysiological study identified the corresponding area in rats as a vagal afferent projection region and examined the cytoarchitecture. Electrical stimulation of the cervical vagus nerve elicited a field potential comparable in waveform, latency, and amplitude to the simultaneously evoked potential in the <BrainRegion>insular visceral sensory cortex</BrainRegion>. The potential field adjoined the <BrainRegion>S1 trigeminal region</BrainRegion> without overlap, and was rostroventral to the lip representation barrel field, which was identified histochemically, and rostrodorsal to the tongue representation region, which was identified electrophysiologically. The vagal potential underwent a phase reversal in the middle layers; thus, the current sink site was cytoarchitectonically identified as the <BrainRegion>most rostral part of the parietal granular cortex</BrainRegion> or the <BrainRegion>S1</BrainRegion>, where no somatosensory input has previously been demonstrated. The rat <BrainRegion>S1</BrainRegion> contains a region representing general visceral information, topographically located as if the visceral organs protruded from the mouth.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>OFF midget bipolar cells in the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> of the marmoset, Callithrix jacchus, express AMPA receptors.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Recent studies suggested that different types of OFF bipolar cells express specific types of ionotropic (AMPA or kainate) glutamate receptors (GluRs) at their contacts with cone pedicles. However, the question of which GluR type is expressed by which type of of flat(OFF) bipolar cell in primate <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> is still open. In this study, the expression of AMPA and kainate receptor subunits at the dendritic tips of flat ( of flat(OFF) ) midget bipolar (FMB) cells was analyzed in the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> of the common marmoset, Callithrix jacchus. We used preembedding electron microscopy and double immunofluorescence with subunit-specific antibodies. The FMB cells were labeled with antibodies against the carbohydrate epitope CD15. Cone pedicles were identified with peanut agglutinin. Immunoreactivity for the GluR1 subunit and for CD15 is preferentially located at triad-associated flat contacts. Furthermore, the large majority of GluR1 immunoreactive puncta is localized at the dendritic tips of FMB cells. These results suggest that FMB cells express the AMPA receptor subunit GluR1. In contrast, the kainate receptor subunit GluR5 is not colocalized with the dendritic tips of FMB cells or with the GluR1 subunit. Immunoreactive puncta for the GluR1 subunit are found at all M/L-cone pedicles but are only rarely associated with S-cone pedicles. This is consistent with our recent findings in marmoset retina that FMB cells do not contact S-cone pedicles. The presence of GluR5 clusters at S-cone pedicles indicates that in primate <BrainRegion>retinas</BrainRegion> of flat(OFF) bipolar cells expressing kainate receptor subunits receive some S-cone input.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Rod and cone specific domains in the interphotoreceptor matrix.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The insoluble matrix domain of the interphotoreceptor matrix (IPM) from normal dog, cat, and mouse <BrainRegion>retinae</BrainRegion> were characterized using lectin cytochemistry. The lectins WGA (wheat germ agglutinin) and PNA (peanut agglutinin) were used to label interphotoreceptor matrix microdomains in cryosections of <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> tissue and in extracted insoluble matrix. <BrainRegion>Retinal</BrainRegion> cryosections and extracted matrix were examined by epifluorescence microscopy and scanning confocal laser microscopy, the latter allowed for the removal of all background fluorescence and gave increased resolution. The insoluble matrix was extracted as a continuous sheet that was comprised of two photoreceptor-specific matrix domains distinguished both by the size of the domains, and by differential binding of wheat germ agglutinin(WGA) and peanut agglutinin(PNA) lectins. Each domain encloses a photoreceptor inner and outer segment. Individual rod-associated domains were connected into a hexagonal lattice and this pattern was regularly interrupted by the larger cone-associated domains which have 8-10 surrounding rod domains. The peanut agglutinin(PNA) lectin primarily labeled the cone-associated matrix with faint binding to the rod matrix; the wheat germ agglutinin(WGA) lectin labeled both the rod- and cone-associated matrix.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>A new ascending sensory tract to the calyces of the honeybee <BrainRegion>mushroom body</BrainRegion>, the subesophageal-calycal tract.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The <BrainRegion>mushroom bodies</BrainRegion> of the honeybee are important neuropils for learning and memory. Therefore, knowledge about their input and output connections is essential to understanding how these neuropils function. A newly described input tract to the <BrainRegion>mushroom body</BrainRegion> is presented here, which is called the subesophageal-calycal tract (SCT) and connects the subesophageal ganglion with the calyces of the mushroom bodies. The neuronal somata of the subesophageal-calycal tract(SCT) neurons lie in one cluster between the lobula of the <BrainRegion>optic lobe</BrainRegion> and a neuropil area that is formed from the fusion of the tritocerebrum and the subesophageal ganglion. Within the subesophageal ganglion, the dendritic fibers of subesophageal-calycal tract(SCT) neurons overlap with terminals of sensory neurons from the proboscis. Therefore, we conclude that the subesophageal-calycal tract(SCT) neurons might process gustatory and mechanosensory information from the proboscis. Individual subesophageal-calycal tract(SCT) neurons receive unilateral input within the subesophageal ganglion and may connect to either the ipsilateral or the <BrainRegion>contralateral mushroom body</BrainRegion>. On their way to the mushroom bodies, the subesophageal-calycal tract(SCT) neuron axons meet the roots of the antennocerebralis tracts (ACTs) and from this point follow the same path as the median ACT neurons for a short distance. Within the calyces, the subesophageal-calycal tract(SCT) neurons innervate two separate areas, a small area within the dorsal collar just below the lip and a part of the basal ring. Double-labeling experiments show that the projections of the subesophageal-calycal tract(SCT) neurons do not overlap with the projections of the <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> projection neurons and visual projection neurons from the <BrainRegion>dorsal medulla</BrainRegion>. The possible function of the subesophageal-calycal tract(SCT) neurons and the relation of the subesophageal-calycal tract(SCT) to known input tracts of the <BrainRegion>mushroom bodies</BrainRegion> in other insects are discussed.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Glycine-immunoreactive projection of the cat <BrainRegion>lateral superior olive</BrainRegion>: possible role in <BrainRegion>midbrain</BrainRegion> ear dominance.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Neurons in the <BrainRegion>lateral superior olive</BrainRegion> are optimally excited by stimulation of the ipsilateral ear, as are those in the <BrainRegion>inferior colliculus</BrainRegion> by stimulation of the contralateral ear. This reversal of ear dominance may result, in part, from distinct crossed excitatory and uncrossed inhibitory pathways ascending from the <BrainRegion>lateral superior olive</BrainRegion>. To explore this possibility, immunoreactivity for two putative inhibitory neurotransmitters, glycine and GABA, was examined in projection neurons that retrogradely transported horseradish peroxidase from the cat <BrainRegion>inferior colliculus</BrainRegion>. The results suggest that the projection from the <BrainRegion>lateral superior olive</BrainRegion> can be segregated, immunocytochemically, into three components: 1) a crossed, glycine-negative (-) projection; 2) an uncrossed, glycine-positive (+) projection; and 3) an uncrossed, glycine(-) projection. Additional evidence suggests that the terminal fields of the two uncrossed projections may distribute differently within the <BrainRegion>inferior colliculus</BrainRegion>. Glycine(+) or glycine(-) projection neurons, crossed or uncrossed, do not differ in the size, shape, or location of their somata. However, most glycine(-) neurons are heavily encrusted with glycine(+) endings; glycine(+) neurons have 40-60% fewer of these endings. Glycine(-) neurons located in the lateral limb have fewer glycine (+) perisomatic endings than those in the <BrainRegion>medial limb</BrainRegion>. Few projection neurons are GABA(+), and GABA(+) perisomatic endings are rare in the <BrainRegion>lateral superior olive</BrainRegion>. Thus, there is a heavy uncrossed projection from the cat <BrainRegion>lateral superior olive</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>inferior colliculus</BrainRegion> that may be glycinergic and inhibitory. Furthermore, there is a bilateral projection that is not glycinergic or GABAergic, which may be excitatory. The potential contribution of these pathways to contralateral ear dominance in the <BrainRegion>inferior colliculus</BrainRegion> is discussed.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Cloning and in situ hybridization analysis of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and androgen receptor expression in the brain of whiptail lizards (Cnemidophorus uniparens and C. inornatus).</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Gonadal steroid hormones act upon specific areas of the vertebrate brain to affect the reproductive physiology and behavior of the animal. Steroid receptors are members of a superfamily of ligand-dependent transcription factors that mediate the effects of steroid hormones by modulating gene expression in the cells containing the receptors. The neuroanatomical distributions of steroid receptor-containing cells have been described for several species by using steroid autoradiography, immunocytochemistry, and more recently in situ hybridization. We have used the polymerase chain reaction to amplify and clone fragments of the estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and androgen receptor of whiptail lizards (genus Cnemidophorus). These clones were used to produce probes for use in in situ hybridization assays and to map the neuroanatomical distribution of all three sex steroid hormone receptors in the <BrainRegion>forebrains</BrainRegion> of unisexual (C. uniparens) and sexual (C. inornatus) species of whiptail lizards. The distribution of receptor-expressing cells reported here is in general agreement with previous reports in other species with receptor-containing cells concentrated in <BrainRegion>septal</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>amygdaloid</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>preoptic</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>hypothalamic nuclei</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>The development of photoreceptors in the zebrafish, brachydanio rerio. II. Function.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The functional development of rod and cone photoreceptors in the zebrafish (Brachydanio rerio) was studied by electroretinographically measuring flicker fusion frequencies. Two to 3 days after fertilization, fish gave little or no response to high intensity stimuli. Increases in sensitivity and flicker resolution were observed after this time. Biphasic response curves typical of adults could be elicited from fish as young as 2 weeks postfertilization, thus indicating a functional divergence of rods and cones. The results are consistent with behavioral and anatomical analyses of zebrafish photoreceptor development.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Neuropeptide tyrosine in the brain of the African lungfish, Protopterus annectens: immunohistochemical localization and biochemical characterization.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Lungfishes, which share similarities with both fishes and amphibians, represent an interesting group in which to investigate the evolutionary transition from fishes to tetrapods. In the present study, we have investigated the localization and biochemical characteristics of neuropeptide Y (NPY)-immunoreactive material in the central nervous system of the African lungfish, Protopterus annectens. neuropeptide Y(NPY) -immunoreactive cell bodies were found in various regions of the brain, most notably in the <BrainRegion>telencephalon</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>septal area</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>ventral striatum</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>nucleus accumbens</BrainRegion>), in the <BrainRegion>diencephalon</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>preoptic nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>periventricular region of the hypothalamus</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>ventral thalamus</BrainRegion>), and in the <BrainRegion>tegmentum</BrainRegion> of the <BrainRegion>mesencephalon</BrainRegion>. A strong immunoreaction was also detected in cell bodies of the <BrainRegion>nervus terminalis</BrainRegion>. Immunoreactive nerve fibers were particularly abundant in the <BrainRegion>ventral striatum</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>nucleus accumbens</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>diagonal band of Broca</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>mesencephalic tegmentum</BrainRegion>. Positive fibers were also seen in the <BrainRegion>median eminence</BrainRegion> and in the <BrainRegion>neural lobe of the pituitary</BrainRegion>. The neuropeptide Y(NPY) -immunoreactive material localized in the brain and <BrainRegion>pituitary</BrainRegion> was characterized by combining high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis and radioimmunological quantitation. The displacement curves obtained with synthetic porcine and frog neuropeptide Y(NPY) and serial dilutions of brain and <BrainRegion>pituitary</BrainRegion> extracts were parallel. Reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography(HPLC) analysis of <BrainRegion>telencephalon</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>diencephalon</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>pituitary</BrainRegion> extracts resolved a major neuropeptide Y(NPY) -immunoreactive peak that coeluted with frog neuropeptide Y(NPY) . The similarity between the distribution of neuropeptide Y(NPY) -containing neurons and the biochemical characteristics of the immunoreactive peptide in the brain of lungfish and frog strongly favors a close phylogenetic relationship between dipnoans and amphibians.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>A cytoarchitectonic atlas of the mouse <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>A description of the organization, areas, and cell groups within the <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion> of the mouse is presented in detail. Photomicrographs of cell-stained serial sections through the <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion> in frontal, sagittal and horizontal planes are included. The <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion> has been divided basically into medial and lateral parts with most well-defined cell groups or nuclei lying within the medial subdivision and surrounded by diffuse collections of cells referred to as areas. The heterogenetiy of cell types within most <BrainRegion>hypothalamic nuclei</BrainRegion> and areas has been emphasized with the consequent implications for heterogeneity of neuronal connections and of functions. Recently introduced neuroanatomical techniques permitting increased attention to the cellular level of organization have demonstrated precise connections and functional localization of cells within the <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion>. While cytoarchitectonic distinctions imply functional distinctions, morphological and experimental evidence suggest the existence also of systems of cells which transcend conventional cytoarchitectonic boundaries, the cells within each system being interconnected functionally or neuronally.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Distinct subsets of sensory <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> neurons in mouse: possible role in the formation of the mosaic <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> projection.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The axons of the primary sensory <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> neurons project from the <BrainRegion>olfactory neuroepithelium</BrainRegion> lining the nasal cavity, onto glomeruli covering the surface of the olfactory bulb. Neuroanatomical studies have shown previously that individual olfactory glomeruli are innervated by neurons that are dispersed widely within the nasal cavity. The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that phenotypically unique subsets of primary sensory <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> neurons, scattered throughout the nasal cavity, project to a subset of glomeruli in specific <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> loci. Immunochemical and histochemical analyses in neonatal mice revealed that the plant lectin, Dolichos biflorus agglutinin, bound to a subset of mature primary sensory <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> neurons which express the olfactory marker protein. This subset of neurons was principally located in the rostromedial and dorsal portions of the nasal cavity and projected specifically to a subset of glomeruli in the <BrainRegion>rostromedial and caudodorsal portions of the olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>. Analysis of Dolichos biflorus-reactive axons revealed that these axons coursed randomly, with no evidence of their selective fasciculation, within the olfactory nerve. It was only at the level of the <BrainRegion>rostral olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> that a significant reorganisation of their trajectory was observed. Within the outer fibre layer of the bulb, discrete bundles of lectin-reactive axons began to coalesce selectively into fascicles which preferentially oriented toward the <BrainRegion>medial side of the olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>. These data demonstrated that a phenotypically distinct subset of primary sensory olfactory neurons exhibits a topographical projection from the <BrainRegion>olfactory epithelium</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>, and suggests that these, and other subsets, may form the basis of the mosaic nature of this pathway. Moreover, it appears that the outer nerve fibre layer in the <BrainRegion>rostral olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> plays an important instructive role in the guidance and fasciculation of <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> sensory axons.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Differential specificity in the glomerular response profiles for alicyclic, bicyclic, and heterocyclic odorants.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>As part of our ongoing effort to relate stimulus to response in the olfactory system, we tested the hypothesis that the unique chemical structures and odors of various cyclic odorants would be associated with unique spatial response patterns in the glomerular layer of the rat <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>. To this end, rats were exposed to sets of odorants, including monocyclic hydrocarbons, bicyclic compounds, and various heterocyclic structures containing oxygen or nitrogen in the ring. Relative activity across the entire layer was assessed by mapping uptake of 2-deoxyglucose into anatomically standardized data matrices. Whereas monocyclic hydrocarbons evoked patterns similar to those evoked by open-chained hydrocarbon odorants, a set of bicyclic compounds with structures and odors similar to camphor evoked uptake in paired ventral domains not previously associated with any other odorant chemical structures. Despite their unique odors as judged by humans, heterocyclic odorants either evoked uptake in previously characterized areas corresponding to their functional groups or stimulated weak or patchy patterns involving isolated glomeruli. Although the patchiness of the patterns may be partially related to the rigidity of the compounds, which would be expected to restrict their interactions to only a few receptors, the weakness of the patterns suggests the possibility of species-specific odorant representations. We conclude that, whereas some of the novel cyclic structures indeed were represented by unique patterns in the rat <BrainRegion>bulb</BrainRegion>, other unique structures were poorly represented, even when they evoked intense and unique odors in humans.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Human nuclear respiratory factor 2 alpha subunit cDNA: isolation, subcloning, sequencing, and in situ hybridization of transcripts in normal and monocularly deprived macaque visual system.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Nuclear respiratory factor 2 (NRF-2) has been shown to contribute to the transcriptional regulation of a number of subunits of respiratory chain enzymes, including cytochrome c oxidase (CO). Our recent study demonstrated a parallel distribution of the alpha subunit proteins of Nuclear respiratory factor 2(NRF-2) ( Nuclear respiratory factor 2(NRF-2) alpha) with c oxidase(CO) in the monkey <BrainRegion>striate cortex</BrainRegion>, and that it can be regulated by neuronal activity. To determine whether this regulation is at the transcriptional level, the present study examined the expression of Nuclear respiratory factor 2(NRF-2) alpha mRNA in normal and monocularly deprived adult monkeys. A partial Nuclear respiratory factor 2(NRF-2) alpha cDNA was isolated from a human brain cDNA library. Sequence analysis revealed that it shared 99% identity with the published sequence from human HeLa cells. Riboprobes of Nuclear respiratory factor 2(NRF-2) alpha was generated and labeled with digoxigenin-11-UTP for in situ hybridization. The expression pattern of Nuclear respiratory factor 2(NRF-2) alpha mRNA in the normal <BrainRegion>striate cortex</BrainRegion> paralleled that of c oxidase(CO) activity. It was highly expressed in layers IVC and VI, which contained high levels of c oxidase(CO) , and more densely expressed in puffs of layers II and III than in interpuffs. In monkeys monocularly treated with tetrodotoxin for 1 day to 2 weeks, both Nuclear respiratory factor 2(NRF-2) alpha expression and c oxidase(CO) activity were reduced in deprived <BrainRegion>ocular dominance columns of the visual cortex</BrainRegion> and in deprived layers of the <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>. These data indicate that, in the normal and visually deprived adult monkeys, Nuclear respiratory factor 2(NRF-2) alpha is regulated by neuronal activity at the transcriptional level.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Neurogenesis in neonatal rat brain is regulated by peripheral injection of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF).</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Many major diseases of human brain involve deficiencies of select neuronal populations. As one approach to repair, we examined regulation of neurogenesis directly in vivo, employing postnatal day 1 (P1) <BrainRegion>cerebellar cortex</BrainRegion>, which is composed primarily of granule neurons and dividing precursors. We focused on basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), which stimulates precursor mitosis in culture and which is highly expressed in cerebellum during neurogenesis. Subcutaneous injection of basic fibroblast growth factor(bFGF) increased [3H]thymidine ([3H]dT) incorporation, a marker for DNA synthesis, by 50% in whole cerebellar homogenates, suggesting that peripherally administered factor altered ongoing neural proliferation. Further, assay of isolated granule precursors revealed a 4-fold increase in [3H]dT incorporation following in vivo basic fibroblast growth factor(bFGF) treatment, indicating that granule neuroblasts were the major basic fibroblast growth factor(bFGF) -responsive population. Morphologic analysis indicated that twice as many granule precursors were in S-phase of the mitotic cycle after peripheral basic fibroblast growth factor(bFGF) . To determine whether other neurogenetic populations respond to peripheral basic fibroblast growth factor(bFGF) , we examined additional brain regions in vivo. basic fibroblast growth factor(bFGF) stimulated DNA synthesis by 68% in <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion>, and by &amp;gt; 250% in <BrainRegion>pontine subventricular zone</BrainRegion> (SVZ). In contrast, incorporation was not altered in <BrainRegion>basal pons</BrainRegion> or <BrainRegion>cerebral cortex</BrainRegion>, regions in which neurogenesis has already ceased. To define potential direct actions of peripherally administered factor, 125I- basic fibroblast growth factor(bFGF) was used to study distribution. Intact 18 kDa 125I- basic fibroblast growth factor(bFGF) was recovered from brain following peripheral injection, suggesting that the factor acted directly to stimulate mitosis in dividing neuroblasts. The stimulation of neuronal proliferation by exogenous basic fibroblast growth factor(bFGF) suggests that the factor normally regulates neurogenesis, and provides new therapeutic approaches to promote functional recovery from nervous system diseases.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Barrelfield of the prenatally X-irradiated rat <BrainRegion>somatosensory cortex</BrainRegion>: a histochemical and electrophysiological study.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The effect of prenatal X-irradiation on the <BrainRegion>vibrissal cortical barrelfield</BrainRegion> of the brain of rats exposed to 200 R on the embryonic day 17 was studied morphologically and electrophysiologically. Cytoarchitectural barrels fail to appear in adult rats that have been subjected to this in utero treatment. However, sections cut in a plane tangential to the <BrainRegion>vibrissal cortex</BrainRegion> and examined for cytochrome oxidase (CO), a mitochondrial enzyme, contained a matrix of patterned cytochrome oxidase(CO) activity which, albeit smaller and weaker in intensity, is similar to cytochrome oxidase(CO) barrels in normal controls. Current source density analysis of cortical field potentials indicated that, as in the normal <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion>, the earliest sink following peripheral stimulation appears in association with this high cytochrome oxidase(CO) activity. These results suggest that the specific <BrainRegion>vibrissal thalamocortical</BrainRegion> pathway sets up an excitatory synaptic activity in the <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion> of the irradiated animal. Efficacy of this route in eliciting postsynaptic spikes in the <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> output neurons was confirmed by recording extracellular spike responses to vibrissa displacements from layer Vb pyramidal neurons that were then injected intracellularly with horseradish peroxidase for later anatomical identification.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Differential distribution of hypocretin (orexin) and melanin-concentrating hormone in the goldfish brain.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The orexigenic peptides hypocretin (orexin) and melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) are involved in the control of food intake and in other homeostatic functions including sleep and arousal. In this article we study the distribution of these peptides in the brain of the goldfish (Carassius auratus), focusing on those regions particularly related to feeding, sleep, and arousal. Although the general distribution of these peptides in goldfish shows many similarities to those described previously in other species, we observed some noteworthy differences. As in other vertebrates, the peptidergic somata lie in the <BrainRegion>anterolateral hypothalamus</BrainRegion>. In goldfish, both hypocretin and melanin-concentrating hormone(MCH) immunoreactive cell bodies project fibers to the <BrainRegion>ventral telencephalon</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion>. At <BrainRegion>mesencephalic</BrainRegion> levels fibers reach the deep layers of the <BrainRegion>optic tectum</BrainRegion> and also course sparsely through the <BrainRegion>mesencephalic tegmentum</BrainRegion>. In contrast to the strong innervation of <BrainRegion>locus coeruleus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>raphe</BrainRegion> in mammal, the melanin-concentrating hormone(MCH) and hypocretin systems in goldfish barely innervate these aminergic populations related to the regulation of sleep and arousal. melanin-concentrating hormone(MCH) , but not hypocretin, immunoreactive fibers terminate substantially in the sensory layer of the <BrainRegion>vagal gustatory lobe</BrainRegion> of goldfish, while both peptidergic systems distribute to the <BrainRegion>primary visceral sensory areas of the medulla and pons</BrainRegion>. The strong involvement of these peptidergic systems with the <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion> and general <BrainRegion>visceral nuclei</BrainRegion>, but not with <BrainRegion>locus coeruleus</BrainRegion> or <BrainRegion>raphe nuclei</BrainRegion> support the view that these peptides originally played a role in regulation of energy balance and evolved secondarily to influence sleep-wakefulness systems in amniote vertebrates.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Distribution of noradrenaline-immunoreactivity in the brain of the mormyrid teleost Gnathonemus petersii.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The distribution of noradrenaline-immunoreactivity in the brain of the mormyrid fish Gnathonemus petersii was studied in order to evaluate the noradrenergic innervation of a number of specialized mormyrid brain regions, including electrosensory centers and a <BrainRegion>gigantocerebellum</BrainRegion>. Noradrenaline-immunoreactive (NAi) neurons occur in the <BrainRegion>hypothalamic paraventricular organ</BrainRegion> (PVO), the <BrainRegion>locus coeruleus</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>caudal rhombencephalon</BrainRegion>. In the <BrainRegion>paraventricular organ</BrainRegion>(PVO) , Noradrenaline-immunoreactive(NAi) <BrainRegion>cerebrospinal fluid</BrainRegion> (CSF)-contacting neurons are located in the same regions where dopamine- and serotonin-containing cerebrospinal fluid(CSF) contacting neurons occur. The <BrainRegion>locus coeruleus</BrainRegion> consists, on each side, of at least 30 rather large Noradrenaline-immunoreactive(NAi) neurons with ventrolaterally directed dendrites and dorsolaterally coursing axons. In the <BrainRegion>caudal rhombencephalon</BrainRegion>, Noradrenaline-immunoreactive(NAi) neurons are located in the transition region between the <BrainRegion>ventromedial motor zone</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>dorsolateral sensory zone</BrainRegion>. The density of Noradrenaline-immunoreactive(NAi) fibers is very high in the efferent tract of the <BrainRegion>locus coeruleus</BrainRegion>, the medial forebrain bundle, and two <BrainRegion>telencephalic</BrainRegion>, one <BrainRegion>preoptic</BrainRegion>, and one <BrainRegion>rhombencephalic subependymal</BrainRegion> axonal plexus. A marked Noradrenaline-immunoreactive(NAi) innervation is present in the <BrainRegion>dorsomedial and ventral telencephalon</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>preoptic region</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>periventricular hypothalamic and thalamic regions</BrainRegion>, the midbrain <BrainRegion>tectum</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>cerebellar</BrainRegion> granular layers, the <BrainRegion>electrosensory lateral line lobe</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>rhombencephalic transition region</BrainRegion> between the <BrainRegion>sensory and motor zones</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>area postrema</BrainRegion>. Other regions are more sparsely innervated by Noradrenaline-immunoreactive(NAi) fibers, but regions completely devoid of Noradrenaline-immunoreactive(NAi) fibers were not observed. Interestingly, Noradrenaline-immunoreactive(NAi) fibers form large club endings in some subdivisions of the <BrainRegion>precerebellar nucleus lateralis valvulae</BrainRegion>, and parallel fibers in the <BrainRegion>cerebellar</BrainRegion> granular layer. Comparison with the distribution of Noradrenaline-immunoreactive(NAi) or dopamine-beta-hydroxylase-immunoreactivity in other species shows that all teleosts studied to date have noradrenergic cells in the <BrainRegion>locus coeruleus</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>caudal rhombencephalon</BrainRegion>. However, Noradrenaline-immunoreactive(NAi) <BrainRegion>cerebrospinal fluid</BrainRegion>(CSF) -contacting <BrainRegion>paraventricular organ</BrainRegion>(PVO) cells have been described only in the teleost Gnathonemus petersii and the lizard Gekko gecko (Smeets and Steinbusch: J. Comp. Neurol. 285:453-466, &apos;89). It is possible that they might pick up catecholamines as well as serotonin from the <BrainRegion>cerebrospinal fluid</BrainRegion>(CSF) , into which monoamines might be released by <BrainRegion>telencephalic and preoptic subependymal</BrainRegion> axonal plexuses.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Highly active neuromuscular system in developing lobsters with programmed obsolescence.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The primary locomotory apparatus in the three larval stages of the lobster, Homarus americanus, are paddlelike structures on the thoracic appendages called exopodites, which beat almost continuously. Consequently their power and return-stroke muscles are examples of highly active but short-lived neuromuscular systems. The muscles, which are well vascularized, are of the fast type with 2-3-micron sarcomere lengths and 6 thin filaments surrounding a thick one. The most striking feature, however, is the large volume of mitochondria making up 40-50% of the fiber. They appear as simple cylinders packed several layers deep along the periphery of the fiber and as large, multibranched forms distributed throughout the fiber and subdividing it into smaller units. The motor innervation to the return-stroke muscle is via 3 excitatory axons, which generate large junctional potentials and twitch contractions. The muscle is densely populated with large neuromuscular synapses, most of which have a well-defined active site or dense bar denoting the site of transmitter release. Altogether this motor system is specialized for prolonged activity. Atrophy of the neuromuscular system occurs by the late larval third stage. The muscle fibers lose their identity, fuse, and become vacuolated. The myofibrils condense and erode and the mitochondria are lost. Atrophy of motor innervation is gradual with individual axons dropping out. The largest axon providing most of the innervation is the first to degenerate. Early degenerative changes affect the axon and neuromuscular terminals but not the synaptic contacts, dense bars, and vesicles, which appear intact. Continued atrophy in the postlarval fourth stage reduces the exopodites to vestiges. Thus the return-stroke muscle of the larval exopodites in which muscle fiber and motoneurons are identifiable permits study of the interaction between a neuron and its target muscle undergoing programmed obsolescence.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Ultrastructural analysis of synaptic relationships of intracellularly stained pyramidal cell axons in <BrainRegion>piriform cortex</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Axons of pyramidal cells in <BrainRegion>piriform cortex</BrainRegion> stained by intracellular injection of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) have been analyzed by light and electron microscopy. Myelinated primary axons give rise to extensive, very fine caliber (0.2 micron) unmyelinated collaterals with stereotyped radiating branching patterns. Serial section electron microscopic analysis of the stained portions of the collateral systems (initial 1-2 mm) revealed that they give rise to synaptic contacts on dendritic spines and shafts. These synapses typically contain compact clusters of large, predominantly spherical synaptic vesicles subjacent to asymmetrical contacts with heavy postsynaptic densities. On the basis of comparisons with Golgi material and intracellularly stained dendrites, it was concluded that dendritic spines receiving synapses from the proximal portions of pyramidal cell axon collaterals originate primarily from pyramidal cell basal dendrites. Postsynaptic dendritic shafts contacted closely resemble dendrites of probable GABAergic neurons identified in antibody and [3H]-GABA uptake studies. Electron microscopic examination of pyramidal cell axon initial segments revealed a high density of symmetrical synaptic contacts on their surfaces. Synaptic vesicles in the presynaptic boutons were small and flattened. It is concluded that pyramidal cells synaptically interact over short distances with other pyramidal cells via basal dendrites and with deep nonpyramidal cells that probably include GABAergic cells mediating a feedback inhibition. This contrasts with long associational projections of pyramidal cells that terminate predominantly on apical dendrites of other pyramidal cells.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Postnatal development and aging of the rat ventral root L5: electron microscopic and immunohistochemical studies.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The ventral root L5 of neonatal and adult rats has been used in many experimental studies on ganglionic C-fibers. Since the normal presence of such axons in L5 roots from animals of different ages is unknown, the results of these studies cannot be appropriately interpreted. In the present study we examine L5 ventral roots from developing and aging rats in this respect. Electron microscopic examination revealed that C-fibers occur in neonatal roots. The adult proportion has been established at day 30. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that thin ganglionic fibers with substance P/calcitonin gene-related peptide- or tyrosine hydroxylase-like immunoreactivity in the L5 root and the <BrainRegion>spinal pia mater</BrainRegion> seem to increase postnatally from low levels at birth. In roots from aged rats, myelinated fibers with a variety of aberrant features occur in normal numbers. The occurrence of unmyelinated axons is elevated. The increased presence of fibers with calcitonin gene-related peptide- or tyrosine hydroxylase-like immunoreactivity in aged roots indicates that the extra unmyelinated fibers may represent motor sprouts and sympathetic fibers, respectively. We conclude that the rat ventral root L5 contains a variable number of putative sensory and sympathetic axons at all ages.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Morphologic representation of visual and antennal information in the ant brain.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Ants in general are primarily <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> animals, but many species also express visual behaviors. We analyze in 14 species, which range from purely <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> to predominantly visually behaving ants, how the brains are equipped to control such behavior. We take the size and manifestation of the eyes as an indicator for the prevalence of vision in a given species, and we correlate it with the size of particular brain regions. Our morphometric data show that the size of the eyes generally correlates well with that of the <BrainRegion>optic lobes</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>antennal lobes</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>mushroom bodies</BrainRegion> have a surprisingly constant relative volume whereas, as expected, the relative size of the <BrainRegion>optic lobes</BrainRegion> varies strongly across species. Males of different species are more similar. Compared with workers, they all have large eyes, relatively larger <BrainRegion>optic lobes</BrainRegion>, smaller <BrainRegion>mushroom bodies</BrainRegion>, and similarly sized antennal lobes. The input regions of the <BrainRegion>mushroom bodies</BrainRegion>, the lip and the collar, generally correlate with the size of the <BrainRegion>optic and antennal lobe</BrainRegion>, respectively. Accordingly, the composition of the calyx reflects the importance of vision for the animal. We present data supporting the view that the <BrainRegion>mushroom bodies</BrainRegion> may participate in spatial orientation, landmark recognition, and visual information storage.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Development and distribution of the peptidergic system in larval and adult Patiriella: comparison of sea star bilateral and radial nervous systems.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Development of the larval peptidergic system in the sea star Patiriella regularis and structure of the adult nervous system in Patiriella species were documented in an immunofluorescence investigation using antisera to the sea star neuropeptide GFNSALMFamide 1 (S1) and confocal microscopy. P. regularis has planktotrophic development through bipinnaria and brachiolaria larvae. In early bipinnaria, two groups of immunoreactive cells appeared on either side of the anterior region and proliferated to form a pair of dorsolateral ganglia. The ganglia gave rise to fine varicose fibres that innervated the preoral and adoral ciliated bands. Peptidergic cells also innervated the postoral ciliated band, and a nerve tract connected the pre- and postoral bands. Fully developed bipinnaria had a well-developed peptidergic system, the organisation of which reflected the bilateral larval body plan. As the brachiolar attachment complex differentiated at the anterior end, the ganglia became positioned on either side of the anterior projection, from which they innervated the complex. It is suggested, based on the distribution of star neuropeptide GFNSALMFamide 1(S1) -like immunoreactivity in association with ciliary and attachment structures, that the peptidergic system functions in modulation of feeding, swimming, and settlement. The larval peptidergic system degenerates as the larval body is resorbed during metamorphosis. In adults, star neuropeptide GFNSALMFamide 1(S1) -like immunoreactivity was intense in the axonal region of the ectoneural nervous system and in hyponeural perikarya. Immunoreactive cells in the neuroepithelium connected with the surface and may be sensory. Examination of immunoreactivity in several Patiriella species attests to the highly conserved organisation of the peptidergic system in adult asteroids.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Selective destruction of mossy fibers and granule cells with preservation of the GABAergic network in the inferior region of the rat <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion> after colchicine treatment.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Lesions induced by colchicine injection into the rat <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion> were investigated by means of electron microscopy and GABA immunocytochemistry. Granule cells were nearly completely destroyed 3 days after colchicine injection; since the necrosis of their axonal endings was delayed, an anterograde degeneration of the mossy fibers had probably taken place. The selectivity of the lesions was not limited to granule cells, for some pyramidal neurons in <BrainRegion>CA1</BrainRegion> pyramidal layer were damaged. It was, however, striking to observe that throughout the <BrainRegion>hippocampal</BrainRegion> structure GABAergic neurons were spared from the effects of colchicine. For instance, GABAergic neurons were found in the vicinity of the completely destroyed granule cell layer. GABAergic neurons and terminals were also present in the <BrainRegion>CA3</BrainRegion> region where the GABA-containing terminals formed a dense network of synapses with somata and dendrites of pyramidal cells. It was interesting to note that, consistent with previous studies, the GABAergic neurons in <BrainRegion>CA3</BrainRegion> are innervated by mossy fibers. We conclude that after colchicine treatment the destruction of the granule cells was not associated with a lesion of the GABAergic network. This selective lesion provides a useful model with which to study the properties of <BrainRegion>CA3</BrainRegion> neurons deprived of their major excitatory input but with an intact inhibitory network.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

For instance, the <BrainRegion>lateroposterior nucleus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>pulvinar</BrainRegion> (LP-PUL) mostly contained thick axons that contributed clusters of large-sized varicosities, each forming multiple asymmetric synapses, usually with vesicle-filled dendrites. In contrast, the <BrainRegion>intralaminar nuclei</BrainRegion> mostly contained thin axonal segments that emitted small en passant varicosities that formed single asymmetric synapses with spines. Because the <BrainRegion>caudate nucleus</BrainRegion> does not project to the <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion>, this labeling had to arise from a neuronal population with branching axons to both structures. Previous findings pointed to three possible sources: <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion> monoaminergic cells, <BrainRegion>intralaminar thalamic</BrainRegion> neurons, and corticostriatal cells. The first candidate could be ruled out because monoaminergic neurons contribute small-sized terminals that usually lack membrane specializations. The second possibility was discarded because retrograde tracer injections into the <BrainRegion>lateroposterior nucleus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>pulvinar</BrainRegion>(LP-PUL) did not give rise to retrograde labeling in the <BrainRegion>intralaminar nuclear complex</BrainRegion> but to massive retrograde labeling in deep layers of <BrainRegion>cortical areas 5 and 7</BrainRegion>. Therefore, we concluded that the <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> anterograde labeling originated from corticostriatal neurons, with axons branching to the <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion>. In keeping with this conclusion, Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) injections into <BrainRegion>cortical areas 5-7</BrainRegion> labeled a group of thick corticothalamic fibers that ended in clusters of large boutons in the <BrainRegion>lateroposterior nucleus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>pulvinar</BrainRegion>(LP-PUL) . These Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin(PHA-L) -positive terminals were indistinguishable from those labeled after injections of biotinylated-dextran amine(BDA) into the <BrainRegion>caudate nucleus</BrainRegion>, but they were easy to distinguish from the typical corticothalamic fibers. These findings indicate that the <BrainRegion>cerebral cortex</BrainRegion> could coordinate the activity of the <BrainRegion>striatum</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion> via a rich axonal network that collateralizes to both structures. The extent and synaptic organization of this branched projection impose a revision of the traditional scheme of <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> connectivity.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Developmental relationship between cholinergic amacrine cell processes and ganglion cell dendrites of the mouse <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Ganglion cells of the mammalian retina undergo structural remodeling before their dendrites are confined to functionally distinct laminas within the inner plexiform layer. It has been proposed that cholinergic amacrine cells provide laminar cues that remodel ganglion cell dendrites, because their processes stratify before those of the ganglion cells. To address this possibility, it is necessary to know whether cholinergic cells contact all or only some classes of ganglion cells during development. We, therefore, used two-photon microscopy to simultaneously reconstruct the dendritic arbors of different classes of ganglion cells and terminal processes of cholinergic cells in neonatal mouse <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>. We determined that, after birth, cholinergic cells contacted only a subset of ganglion cells. Large bistratified cells (LBCs), resembling direction selective ganglion cells in other species, had dendrites that fasciculated with the cholinergic plexuses. The Large bistratified cells(LBCs) received numerous presynaptic cholinergic contacts shortly after birth. In contrast, large monostratified cells (LMCs), ramifying outside the cholinergic plexuses at maturity, received few, if any, cholinergic contacts even at early stages when their dendrites overlapped with the cholinergic processes. These observations suggest that cholinergic cells provide laminar cues for only subsets of ganglion cells. They also indicate that the synaptic organization between amacrine and ganglion cells may be specified early in development.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>The organization of the <BrainRegion>second somatosensory area</BrainRegion> (SmII) of the grey squirrel.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Microelectrode mapping methods were used to determine the organization of the <BrainRegion>second somatosensory</BrainRegion> representation, SmII, in grey squirrels. A systematic representation of the contralateral body surface was found in <BrainRegion>lateral parietal cortex</BrainRegion> adjoining the first somatosensory representation, <BrainRegion>SmI</BrainRegion> (Sur et al., &apos;78a). The representation of the body in <BrainRegion>SmII</BrainRegion> was found to be much less distorted than in <BrainRegion>SmI</BrainRegion>. Under our recording conditions, almost all recording sites were activated from strictly contralateral body locations. The most important finding was that the basic orientation of the body representation in SmII is &quot;erect" rather than "inverted." This orientation allows <BrainRegion>SmII</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>SmI</BrainRegion> to be adjoined along a common border representing the top of the head and face. This type of border has been called congruent (Allman and Kaas, &apos;75; Kaas, '77), and it may have significance in the development of sensory representations.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Inspiratory augmenting bulbospinal neurons express both glutamatergic and enkephalinergic phenotypes.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Many of the inspiratory augmenting (I-AUG) neurons of the <BrainRegion>rostral ventral respiratory group</BrainRegion> (rVRG) are premotor neurons that excite phrenic motor neurons during inspiration, probably by releasing glutamate. In the present study, we demonstrate that these neurons are indeed glutamatergic, in that their cell bodies contain vesicular glutamate transporter-2 (VGLUT2) mRNA and spinal terminals from neurons in the region of the <BrainRegion>rostral ventral respiratory group</BrainRegion>(rVRG) contain vesicular glutamate transporter-2(VGLUT2) protein. We also demonstrate by using parallel in situ hybridization and immunocytochemical evidence that most <BrainRegion>rostral ventral respiratory group</BrainRegion>(rVRG) inspiratory premotor neurons are enkephalinergic. After iontophoretic deposits of biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) in the area of the <BrainRegion>rostral ventral respiratory group</BrainRegion>(rVRG) , many biotinylated dextran amine(BDA) -labeled terminals in the <BrainRegion>ventral horn of cervical spinal cord</BrainRegion> (C4-C5) were immunoreactive for enkephalin and vesicular glutamate transporter-2(VGLUT2) . Injections of Fluoro-Gold amidst phrenic motor neurons in C4-C5 labeled neurons in the area of the <BrainRegion>rostral ventral respiratory group</BrainRegion>(rVRG) that contained both vesicular glutamate transporter-2(VGLUT2) mRNA and preproenkephalin (PPE) mRNA as revealed by double in situ hybridization. Thirty-eight bulbospinal inspiratory augmenting(I-AUG) neurons were recorded in the <BrainRegion>rostral ventral respiratory group</BrainRegion>(rVRG) and filled with biotinamide by using the juxtacellular labeling technique. Every biotinamide-filled cell tested was positively labeled for vesicular glutamate transporter-2(VGLUT2) mRNA (n = 14), and most of the cells tested in a separate population exhibited preproenkephalin(PPE) mRNA (16/18). We conclude that most of the phrenic inspiratory premotor neurons of the <BrainRegion>rostral ventral respiratory group</BrainRegion>(rVRG) are glutamatergic neurons that may also release enkephalins.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Trafficking of the muscarinic m2 autoreceptor in cholinergic <BrainRegion>basalocortical</BrainRegion> neurons in vivo: differential regulation of plasma membrane receptor availability and intraneuronal localization in acetylcholinesterase-deficient and -inhibited mice.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>In vivo, the abundance of receptors at the neuronal plasma membrane may be critical in the mediation of pre- and postsynaptic responses. Thus, we have studied the membrane availability and intraneuronal distribution of the m2 muscarinic autoreceptor (m2R) in cholinergic neurons of the <BrainRegion>nucleus basalis magnocellularis</BrainRegion> (NBM) projecting to the <BrainRegion>frontal cortex</BrainRegion> (FC). We have studied the subcellular compartmentalization of m2 muscarinic autoreceptor(m2R) at somatodendritic postsynaptic and axonal presynaptic sites in control animals (AChE +/+) and in two animal models: mice displaying acute acetylcholinesterase ( acetylcholinesterase(AChE) ) inhibition by treatment with metrifonate, and acetylcholinesterase(AChE) -deficient mice ( acetylcholinesterase(AChE) -/-). In control animals, m2 muscarinic autoreceptor(m2R) was mainly located at the plasma membrane in the somatodendritic field of <BrainRegion>nucleus basalis magnocellularis</BrainRegion>(NBM) and in cortical varicosities. Acute acetylcholinesterase(AChE) inhibition and chronic acetylcholinesterase(AChE) deficiency induced a dramatic decrease of cell surface m2 muscarinic autoreceptor(m2R) in the somatodendritic compartment. This finding was associated with two different intracytoplasmic events: (1). internalization of m2 muscarinic autoreceptor(m2R) in endosomes after acute acetylcholinesterase(AChE) inhibition, (2). exaggerated storage of m2 muscarinic autoreceptor(m2R) in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex in acetylcholinesterase(AChE) -/- mice. In contrast, the m2 muscarinic autoreceptor(m2R) density was higher at the membrane of cortical varicosities in acetylcholinesterase(AChE) -/- mice but unchanged in acutely acetylcholinesterase(AChE) -inhibited mice. Our data demonstrate that acute and chronic stimulation provoke, in vivo, depletion of the membrane store of somatodendritic m2 muscarinic autoreceptor(m2R) through different intracellular mechanisms: endocytosis of receptors from the plasma membrane to the cytoplasm (acute) or regulation of their delivery from intracytoplasmic stores to the plasma membrane (chronic). The increase of m2 muscarinic autoreceptor(m2R) at the membrane of axonal varicosities after chronic stimulation suggest modulation of presynaptic cholinergic activity, including neurotransmitter release.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Neurofilament spacing, phosphorylation, and axon diameter in regenerating and uninjured lamprey axons.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>It has been postulated that phosphorylation of the carboxy terminus sidearms of neurofilaments (NFs) increases axon diameter through repulsive electrostatic forces that increase sidearm extension and interfilament spacing. To evaluate this hypothesis, the relationships among NF phosphorylation, NF spacing, and axon diameter were examined in uninjured and spinal cord-transected larval sea lampreys (Petromyzon marinus). In untransected animals, axon diameters in the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> varied from 0.5 to 50 microns. Antibodies specific for highly phosphorylated neurofilaments(NFs) labeled only large axons (&amp;gt; 10 microns), whereas antibodies for lightly phosphorylated neurofilaments(NFs) labeled medium-sized and small axons more darkly than large axons. For most axons in untransected animals, diameter was inversely related to NF packing density, but the interfilament distances of the largest axons were only 1.5 times those of the smallest axons. In addition, the lightly phosphorylated neurofilaments(NFs) of the small axons in the dorsal columns were widely spaced, suggesting that phosphorylation of neurofilaments(NFs) does not rigidly determine their spacing and that NF spacing does not rigidly determine axon diameter. Regenerating neurites of giant <BrainRegion>reticulospinal</BrainRegion> axons (GRAs) have diameters only 5-10% of those of their parent axons. If axon caliber is controlled by NF phosphorylation via mutual electrostatic repulsion, then neurofilaments(NFs) in the slender regenerating neurites should be lightly phosphorylated and densely packed (similar to neurofilaments(NFs) in uninjured small caliber axons), whereas neurofilaments(NFs) in the parent giant <BrainRegion>reticulospinal</BrainRegion> axons(GRAs) should be highly phosphorylated and loosely packed. However, although linear density of neurofilaments(NFs) (the number of neurofilaments(NFs) per micrometer) in these slender regenerating neurites was twice that in their parent axons, they were highly phosphorylated. Following sectioning of these same axons close to the cell body, axon-like neurites regenerated ectopically from dendritic tips. These ectopically regenerating neurites had NF linear densities 2.5 times those of uncut giant <BrainRegion>reticulospinal</BrainRegion> axons(GRAs) but were also highly phosphorylated. Thus, in the lamprey, NF phosphorylation may not control axon diameter directly through electrorepulsive charges that increase NF sidearm extension and NF spacing. It is possible that phosphorylation of neurofilaments(NFs) normally influences axon diameter through indirect mechanisms, such as the slowing of NF transport and the formation of a stationary cytoskeletal lattice, as has been proposed by others. Such a mechanism could be overridden during regeneration, when a more compact, phosphorylated NF backbone might add mechanical stiffness that promotes the advance of the neurite tip within a restricted central nervous system environment.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>A combined Golgi and autoradiographic study of (3H)glycine-accumulating amacrine cells in the cat <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Golgi techniques were combined with electron microscopic autoradiography to identify four subpopulations of amacrine cell in the cat retina which accumulate (3H)glycine. These subpopulations include types A3, A4, A7(AII), and A8 amacrine cells. All are narrow-field cells with dendritic spreads of less than 100 micron. Quantification of silver grains showed that each subpopulation exhibits a consistent affinity for (3H)glycine. Type A8 cells were found to have the greatest affinity with normalized grain densities of 0.88-1.0 grains/micron 2 on a scale in which 1.0 represents the most heavily labeled cell. Type A4 cells were moderately labeled with grain densities ranging from 0.40 to 0.68 grains/micron 2. A7(AII) and A3 amacrines were lightly labeled with grain densities of 0.33-0.35 grains/micron 2 and 0.28-0.30 grains/micron 2, respectively.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>A cerebello-pulvino-cortical and a retino-pulvino-cortical pathways in the cat as revealed by the use of the anterograde and retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>A cerebello-pulvino-cortical and a retino-pulvino-cortical pathways were revealed in the cat by means of the horseradish peroxidase (HRP) method. The sites of termination of the cerebellofugal and retinofugal fibers in the <BrainRegion>pulvinar nucleus</BrainRegion> (Pul) were visualized by the use of the anterograde transport of horseradish peroxidase(HRP) . The cerebello-pulvinar fibers were found to arise mainly from the <BrainRegion>parvicellular region of the lateral cerebellar nucleus</BrainRegion> and to terminate contralaterally in a narrow area at the extreme <BrainRegion>dorsolateral edge of the pulvinar nucleus</BrainRegion>(Pul) at the level of the stereotaxic frontal plane A-7.0. The area of terminal ramification of retino-pulvinar fibers was seen as a thin sheet lying at the extreme <BrainRegion>lateral edge of the pulvinar nucleus</BrainRegion>(Pul) through most of the <BrainRegion>rostrocaudal extent of the pulvinar nucleus</BrainRegion>(Pul) , bilaterally with contralateral predominance. The <BrainRegion>cerebellorecipient area in the pulvinar nucleus</BrainRegion>(Pul) did not seem to overlap with the <BrainRegion>retinorecipient pulvinar nucleus</BrainRegion>(Pul) area; the former appeared to be contiguous ventrolaterally to the latter. The <BrainRegion>cerebellorecipient and retinorecipient pulvinar nucleus(Pul) areas</BrainRegion> were also observed to be connected reciprocally with the <BrainRegion>cerebral cortical areas</BrainRegion>; the former was connected with the most <BrainRegion>posterior part of the area 20</BrainRegion>, and the latter with the <BrainRegion>area 19</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Odor-stimulated glutamatergic neurotransmission in the zebrafish <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The role of glutamate as a neurotransmitter in the zebrafish olfactory bulb (OB) was established by examining neuronal activation following 1). glutamate receptor agonist stimulation of isolated <BrainRegion>olfactory bulbs</BrainRegion> and 2). odorant stimulation of intact fish. Four groups of neurons (mitral cells, projection neurons; granule cells, juxtaglomerular cells, and tyrosine hydroxylase-containing cells; interneurons) were identified on the basis of cell size, cell location, ionotropic glutamate receptor (iGluR) agonist/odorant sensitivity, and glutamate, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity. Immunoreactive glutamate levels were highest in <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> sensory neurons (OSNs) and mitral cells, the putative glutamatergic neurons. The sensitivity of <BrainRegion>bulbar</BrainRegion> neurons to ionotropic glutamate receptor(iGluR) agonists and odorants was established using a cationic channel permeant probe, agmatine (AGB). Agmatine that permeated agonist- or odor-activated ionotropic glutamate receptor(iGluR) s was fixed in place with glutaraldehyde and detected immunohistochemically. N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) and alpha-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA)/kainic acid (KA) ionotropic glutamate receptor(iGluR) agonists and odorants (glutamine, taurocholic acid) stimulated activity-dependent labeling of bulbar neurons, which was blocked with a mixture of the ionotropic glutamate receptor(iGluR) antagonists, D-2-amino-5-phosphono-valeric acid (APV) and 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX). The AMPA/ /kainic acid(KA) antagonist 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione(CNQX) completely blocked glutamine-stimulated AGB labeling of granule cells and tyrosine hydroxylase-containing cells, suggesting that, in these cell types, AMPA/ /kainic acid(KA) receptor activation is essential for N-methyl-D-aspartic acid(NMDA) receptor activation. However, blocking AMPA/ /kainic acid(KA) receptor activity failed to eliminate AGB labeling of mitral cells or juxtaglomerular cells. Collectively, these findings indicate that glutamate is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the zebrafish <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>(OB) and that ionotropic glutamate receptor(iGluR) subtypes function heterogeneously in the <BrainRegion>bulbar</BrainRegion> neurons.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Intrinsic circuitry: synapses involving the local axon collaterals of corticocortical projection neurons in the mouse <BrainRegion>primary somatosensory cortex</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Pyramidal neurons in the mouse <BrainRegion>SmI cortex</BrainRegion> were labeled by the retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) injected into the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral MsI cortex</BrainRegion>. Terminals of the local axon collaterals of these neurons (CC terminals) were identified in <BrainRegion>SmI</BrainRegion>, and their distribution and synaptic connectivity were examined. To avoid confusion, terminals in <BrainRegion>SmI cortex</BrainRegion> labeled by the anterograde transport of horseradish peroxidase(HRP) injected into <BrainRegion>MsI</BrainRegion> were eliminated by lesion-induced degeneration. Lesions of <BrainRegion>MsI</BrainRegion> were made 24 hours after the injection of horseradish peroxidase(HRP) ; postlesion survival time was 4 days. Most CC axon terminals occurred in layers III and V where they formed asymmetrical synapses. Of 139 CC synapses in layer III and 104 in layer V, approximately 13% were formed with dendritic shafts. Reconstruction of 19 of these dendrites from serial thin sections showed them to originate from both spiny and nonspiny neurons. Most synapses of CC terminals (about 87%) were onto dendritic spines. In contrast, White and Keller (1987) demonstrated that terminals belonging to the local axon collaterals of corticothalamic (CT) projection cells synapse mainly with dendritic shafts of nonspiny neurons: 92% onto shafts, the remainder onto spines. The distribution of asymmetical synapses onto spines and dendritic shafts was analyzed for neuropil in layers III, IV, and V. Depending on the layer, from 34 to 46% of the asymmetrical synapses in the neuropil were onto dendritic shafts. Results showing that CC and corticothalamic(CT) terminals form proportions of axodendritic vs. axospinous synapses that differ from each other, and from the neuropil, indicate that local axon collaterals are highly selective with regard to their postsynaptic elements.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Organization of the descending projections from the <BrainRegion>parabrachial nucleus</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>trigeminal sensory nuclear complex</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>spinal dorsal horn</BrainRegion> in the rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>To clarify direct descending projections from the <BrainRegion>parabrachial nucleus</BrainRegion> (PB) to the <BrainRegion>trigeminal sensory nuclear complex</BrainRegion> (TSNC) and <BrainRegion>spinal dorsal horn</BrainRegion> (SpDH), the origin and termination of descending tract cells were examined by the anterograde and retrograde transport methods. Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) and Fluorogold (FG) or dextran-tetramethylrhodamine (Rho) were used as neuronal tracers for the anterograde and retrograde transport, respectively. The <BrainRegion>ventrolateral parabrachial nucleus</BrainRegion>(PB) , including <BrainRegion>Kölliker-Fuse nucleus</BrainRegion> (KF), sent axons terminating mainly in the <BrainRegion>ventrolateral parts of rostral trigeminal nuclei of the principalis (Vp), oralis (Vo), and interpolaris</BrainRegion> (Vi) as well as in the inner lamina II of the <BrainRegion>medullary</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>nucleus caudalis</BrainRegion>, Vc) and <BrainRegion>spinal dorsal horn</BrainRegion>(SpDH) . Although the descending projections were bilateral with an ipsilateral dominance, <BrainRegion>trigeminal sensory nuclear complex</BrainRegion>(TSNC) received a more dominant ipsilateral projection than <BrainRegion>spinal dorsal horn</BrainRegion>(SpDH) . The cells of origin of the descending tracts were located mainly in <BrainRegion>Kölliker-Fuse nucleus</BrainRegion>(KF) , but <BrainRegion>trigeminal sensory nuclear complex</BrainRegion>(TSNC) received fewer projections from the <BrainRegion>Kölliker-Fuse nucleus</BrainRegion>(KF) than <BrainRegion>spinal dorsal horn</BrainRegion>(SpDH) . Namely, <BrainRegion>trigeminal sensory nuclear complex</BrainRegion>(TSNC) received a considerable projection from the <BrainRegion>medial subnucleus of parabrachial nucleus</BrainRegion>(PB) and the <BrainRegion>ventral parts of lateral subnuclei of parabrachial nucleus</BrainRegion>(PB) , such as the <BrainRegion>central lateral subnucleus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>lateral crescent area</BrainRegion>. The other difference noted between <BrainRegion>trigeminal sensory nuclear complex</BrainRegion>(TSNC) and <BrainRegion>spinal dorsal horn</BrainRegion>(SpDH) was that the former received projections mainly from the <BrainRegion>caudal two thirds of Kölliker-Fuse nucleus</BrainRegion>(KF) and the latter from the <BrainRegion>rostral two thirds of Kölliker-Fuse nucleus</BrainRegion>(KF) . These results demonstrate the existence of direct <BrainRegion>parabrachial</BrainRegion> projections to <BrainRegion>trigeminal sensory nuclear complex</BrainRegion>(TSNC) and <BrainRegion>spinal dorsal horn</BrainRegion>(SpDH) that are organized in a distinct manner and suggest that both pathways are involved in the control of nociception.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Neural stem and progenitor cells in nestin-GFP transgenic mice.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Neural stem cells generate a wide spectrum of cell types in developing and adult nervous systems. These cells are marked by expression of the intermediate filament nestin. We used the regulatory elements of the nestin gene to generate transgenic mice in which neural stem cells of the embryonic and adult brain are marked by the expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP). We used these animals as a reporter line for studying neural stem and progenitor cells in the developing and adult nervous systems. In these nestin- green fluorescent protein(GFP) animals, we found that green fluorescent protein(GFP) -positive cells reflect the distribution of nestin-positive cells and accurately mark the neurogenic areas of the adult brain. Nestin- green fluorescent protein(GFP) cells can be isolated with high purity by using fluorescent-activated cell sorting and can generate multipotential neurospheres. In the adult brain, nestin- green fluorescent protein(GFP) cells are approximately 1,400-fold more efficient in generating neurospheres than are green fluorescent protein(GFP) -negative cells and, despite their small number, give rise to 70 times more neurospheres than does the green fluorescent protein(GFP) -negative population. We characterized the expression of a panel of differentiation markers in green fluorescent protein(GFP) -positive cells in the nestin- green fluorescent protein(GFP) transgenics and found that these cells can be divided into two groups based on the strength of their green fluorescent protein(GFP) signal: green fluorescent protein(GFP) -bright cells express glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) but not betaIII-tubulin, whereas green fluorescent protein(GFP) -dim cells express betaIII-tubulin but not glial fibrillary acidic protein(GFAP) . These two classes of cells represent distinct classes of neuronal precursors in the adult mammalian brain, and may reflect different stages of neuronal differentiation. We also found unusual features of nestin- green fluorescent protein(GFP) -positive cells in the subgranular cell layer of the <BrainRegion>dentate gyrus</BrainRegion>. Together, our results indicate that green fluorescent protein(GFP) -positive cells in our transgenic animals accurately represent neural stem and progenitor cells and suggest that these nestin- green fluorescent protein(GFP) -expressing cells encompass the majority of the neural stem cells in the adult brain.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Localization of motoneurons innervating the extraocular muscles in Salamandra salamandra L. (Amphibia, Urodela).</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The central innervation patterns of the extraocular muscles were investigated in the European fire salamander Salamandra salamandra L. by means of the horseradish peroxidase method. The <BrainRegion>ipsilateral portion of the nucleus nervi oculomotorii</BrainRegion>, which is located in the <BrainRegion>rostral ventral tegmentum mesencephali</BrainRegion>, supplies the musculi recti inferior and medialis and the musculus obliquus inferior without a clear somatotopic representation of the motoneurons. The musculus rectus superior is innervated mainly by a contralateral portion of this nucleus. A definite nucleus Edinger-Westphal could not be recognized. The <BrainRegion>nucleus nervi trochlearis</BrainRegion>, which rostrally joins the <BrainRegion>nucleus nervi oculomotorii</BrainRegion> with a gap of only about 40 micron between the nuclei, is situated completely contralateral to the musculus obliquus superior supplied by it. The <BrainRegion>nucleus nervi abducentis</BrainRegion>, innervating the musculus rectus lateralis, and the <BrainRegion>nucleus accessorius nervi abducentis</BrainRegion>, supplying the musculus retractor bulbi, are found in the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral medulla oblongata</BrainRegion> and exhibit a large rostrocaudal extension from the <BrainRegion>eighth cranial nerve</BrainRegion> to the first root of the vagus nerve.

<ArticleTitle>Subunit composition and novel localization of K+ channels in <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Axonal K+ channels involved in normal <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> function are candidate targets for therapeutics, which improve sensorimotor function in <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> injury. To this end, we have investigated the expression, localization, and coassociation of Kv1 alpha and beta subunits in human, rat, and bovine <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>. We find that Kv1.1, Kv1.2, and Kvbeta2 form heteromultimeric complexes at juxtaparanodal zones in myelinated fibers. However, these same complexes are also present in paranodal regions of some <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> axons, and staining with antibodies against Caspr, a component of the paranodal axoglial junction, overlaps with these paranodal K+ channels. This latter observation suggests a unique role for these channels in normal <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> function and may provide an explanation for the sensitivity of <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> to K+ channel blockers. Moreover, the conservation of these characteristics between human, rat, and bovine nodes of Ranvier suggests an essential role for this defined channel complex in <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> function.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Motoneuron number in the lumbar lateral motor column of larval and adult bullfrogs.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Motoneuron number in the lumbar lateral motor column of the bullfrog, Rana catesbeiana, was investigated through the course of premetamorphic development and in postmetamorphic frogs. Motoneurons were distinguished on the basis of histological characteristics into two classes, type L (less differentiated) and type M (more differentiated). The number of type L motoneurons on each side showed a precipitous decline between stages V and VI (6,300 to 2,500) and a slower rate of loss until stage XI (to 550). Type M motoneurons increased in number between stages V and VII (560 to 2,775) and declined precipitously between stages VII and VIII to a value similar to that of juvenile frogs (1,100). These changes in motoneuron number do not correspond to the formation of myotubes or to the appearance of contractile properties in hindlimb muscles. The development of myotubes in the hindlimb occurs only after total motoneuron number has declined by 35%. Similarly, hindlimb muscle contraction develops after the early decline in type L motoneuron number and is restricted to proximal thigh at the peak of type M motoneuron number. In postmetamorphic frogs, a weak (r = 0.44) but statistically significant correlation was found between type M motoneuron number and body length. In the largest frogs (greater than 15 cm body length), 1262 +/- 157 (mean +/- s.d.) motoneurons were present, whereas the smallest frogs (less than 5 cm body length) had 1099 +/- 98 motoneurons. These results are not consistent with previous findings that the variance of motoneuron number among small frogs is greater than that among larger frogs. The present results are thus inconsistent with explanations of size-related differences in motoneuron number that are based on selection of small frogs with greater number of motoneurons for survival. The increase in motoneuron number may be due to a slow addition of newly born motoneurons to the LMC or to the differentiation of existing motoneurons. The latter possibility is supported by the finding that the number of presumptive type L profiles is less in larger frogs.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Ultrastructural changes in the nucleolus of facial motor neurons following axotomy during an early critical period in development.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>In this study, the effects of axotomy on the ultrastructure of the nucleolus and associated organelles were examined in fetal, newborn, and early postnatal facial motoneurons of the hamster. Golden hamsters used for this study were the 14-day fetus, newborn (0 days; less than 6 hr) and 2, 4, 7, and 9 days postnatal ages, with 3 animals per group. For prenatal surgeries, pregnant hamsters were anesthetized and the facial nerves severed in the fetuses via electrocautery through the uterine wall and amniotic membrane. For postnatal surgeries, the animals were anesthetized and the right facial nerve exposed and severed at its exit from the stylomastoid foramen. At the appropriate postoperative times, the animals were reanesthetized and perfused-fixed. The facial nuclear groups were dissected and processed for routine electron microscopy. Microbody and coiled body frequencies were determined from the number of neurons containing these structures per number of neurons sampled per animal in each experimental or control group and subjected to statistical analysis. Nucleolar reactive changes that occurred during this developmental sequence fell into two major categories. The first category displayed by most injured cells consisted of an initial compacting of fibrillar material and reduction in vacuolar space. The second category appeared to represent a progression from this first stage of nucleolar reactivity into degenerative changes involving a striking segregation of nucleolar components into five distinct regions. The incidence of microbodies increased as a result of axotomy, whereas the presence of coiled bodies decreased at the later postoperative stages in the older animals. With increasing age and nucleolar maturation, the nucleolar reactive pattern became less pronounced and severe, and neuronal survival predominated. It appears, therefore, that the two categories of nucleolar changes following axotomy during early development correlate with changes observed in nucleoli under conditions of rRNA downregulation. It is hypothesized from these results that a key step in the ability of neurons to survive axotomy and successfully regenerate at these early developmental stages occurs at some point in ribosomal RNA transcription and/or processing. Complementary information at the molecular level concerning changes in nucleolar synthetic activity and ribosome production will be necessary to test this hypothesis.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Axotomy induces a different modulation of both low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor and choline acetyltransferase between adult rat <BrainRegion>spinal</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion> motoneurons.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Adult rat <BrainRegion>spinal</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion> motoneurons re-express low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor (p75) after their axotomy. We have previously reported and quantified the time course of this reexpression in <BrainRegion>spinal</BrainRegion> motoneurons following several types of injuries of the sciatic nerve. Other studies reported the reexpression of p75 in axotomized brainstem motoneurons. Results of these previous studies differed regarding the type of the most effective triggering injury for p75 reexpression, the relative duration of this reexpression and the decrease of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) immunoreactivity (-IR) following a permanent axotomy of <BrainRegion>spinal</BrainRegion> or <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion> motoneurons. These differences suggest that these two populations of motoneurons respond to axotomy with a different modulation of p75 and choline acetyltransferase(ChAT) expression. The aim of the present study was to determine whether differential modulation exists. We have analyzed and quantified the presence of p75- and choline acetyltransferase(ChAT) -IR motoneurons in the <BrainRegion>hypoglossal nucleus</BrainRegion> following the same types of injury and the same time course we previously used for sciatic motoneurons. The results show that a nerve crush is the most effective triggering injury for p75 and that it induces similar temporal patterns of p75 and choline acetyltransferase(ChAT) expression for sciatic and <BrainRegion>hypoglossal</BrainRegion> motoneurons. In contrast, a cut injury of the sciatic and <BrainRegion>hypoglossal nerves</BrainRegion> resulted in distinct temporal courses of both p75 and choline acetyltransferase(ChAT) expression between these two populations of motoneurons. In fact, a permanent axotomy of the <BrainRegion>hypoglossal</BrainRegion> motoneurons induced i) a much longer maintenance phase for p75 than in sciatic motoneurons and ii) a progressive loss of choline acetyltransferase(ChAT) -IR with a successive return to normal values in contrast to the modest decrease in the sciatic motoneurons. This evidence indicates that <BrainRegion>spinal</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion> motoneurons respond to a permanent axotomy with a different modulation of p75 and choline acetyltransferase(ChAT) expression. Altogether, the present data and the reported evidence of a differential post-axotomy cell death support the hypothesis that these two populations of motoneurons undergo different dynamic changes after axotomy.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Calcitonin-gene related peptide is an evolutionarily conserved marker within the amniote thalamo-telencephalic auditory pathway.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The distribution of neurons and fibers containing calcitonin-gene-related peptide (CGRP) was mapped in the thalamo-telencephalic auditory pathways of four amniote species, rats, pigeons (Columba livia), caiman (Caiman crocodilus), and turtles (Pseudemys scripta). In colchicine-treated turtles and pigeons, numerous calcitonin-gene-related peptide(CGRP) + perikarya were observed in the <BrainRegion>auditory relay nucleus</BrainRegion> of the <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion> (n. reuniens of reptiles, and n. ovoidalis of birds). In pigeons, these neurons were most abundant in the outer circumference of the nucleus and were not observed without colchicine pretreatment. In the <BrainRegion>telencephalon</BrainRegion> of turtles, caiman, and pigeons, calcitonin-gene-related peptide(CGRP) + fibers were observed within portions of the dorsal ventricular ridge previously shown to receive projections from the <BrainRegion>auditory thalamus</BrainRegion>, thus implying that the <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> calcitonin-gene-related peptide(CGRP) + neurons observed here in fact project to these <BrainRegion>telencephalic areas</BrainRegion>. In colchicine treated rats, numerous calcitonin-gene-related peptide(CGRP) + perikarya were observed along the ventral margin of the <BrainRegion>medial geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion> extending into the <BrainRegion>posterior intralaminar and peripeduncular nuclei</BrainRegion>, as well as occasionally within the <BrainRegion>ventral subdivision of the medial geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>. Injections of fluorogold into the <BrainRegion>auditory cortex</BrainRegion> combined with immunofluorescence labeling for calcitonin-gene-related peptide(CGRP) revealed that calcitonin-gene-related peptide(CGRP) + cells in these areas do, in fact, project to the <BrainRegion>auditory cortices</BrainRegion>. The present results are interpreted as providing strong support for the theory, advanced previously, that the <BrainRegion>medial geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion> of mammals, <BrainRegion>nucleus ovoidalis</BrainRegion> of birds, and <BrainRegion>nucleus reuniens</BrainRegion> of reptiles contain at least some homologous cell populations. Although the data are consistent with the theory that the <BrainRegion>telencephalic</BrainRegion> projection fields are homologous, other interpretations are also consistent with the data presented here. These include the possibility that <BrainRegion>auditory thalamic</BrainRegion> projections to the <BrainRegion>telencephalon</BrainRegion> arose independently in the lines of evolution leading to mammals and sauropsids.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Distribution of gonadal steroid receptor-containing neurons in the <BrainRegion>preoptic</BrainRegion>-<BrainRegion>periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion>-<BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion> pathway: a potential circuit for the initiation of male sexual behavior.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The present study used anterograde and retrograde tract tracing techniques to examine the organization of the <BrainRegion>medial preoptic</BrainRegion>-<BrainRegion>periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion>-<BrainRegion>nucleus paragigantocellularis</BrainRegion> pathway in the male rat. The location of neurons containing estrogen (alpha subtype; ER alpha) and androgen receptors (AR) were also examined. We report here that injection of the anterograde tracer biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) into the <BrainRegion>medial preoptic</BrainRegion> (MPO) produced dense labeling within the <BrainRegion>periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion> (PAG); anterogradely labeled fibers terminated in close juxtaposition to neurons retrogradely labeled from the <BrainRegion>nucleus paragigantocellularis</BrainRegion> (nPGi). Dual immunostaining for Fluoro-Gold (FG) and ER alpha or Fluoro-Gold(FG) and androgen receptors(AR) showed that over one-third of <BrainRegion>medial preoptic</BrainRegion>(MPO) efferents to the <BrainRegion>periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion>(PAG) contain receptors for either estrogen or androgen. In addition, approximately 50% of <BrainRegion>periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion>(PAG) neurons retrogradely labeled from the <BrainRegion>nucleus paragigantocellularis</BrainRegion>(nPGi) were immunoreactive for either ER alpha or androgen receptors(AR) . These results are the first to establish an <BrainRegion>medial preoptic</BrainRegion>(MPO) --&amp;gt; <BrainRegion>periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion>(PAG) --&amp;gt; <BrainRegion>nucleus paragigantocellularis</BrainRegion>(nPGi) circuit and further indicate that gonadal steroids can influence neuronal synaptic activity within these sites. We reported previously that <BrainRegion>nucleus paragigantocellularis</BrainRegion>(nPGi) <BrainRegion>reticulospinal</BrainRegion> neurons terminate preferentially within the motoneuronal pools of the <BrainRegion>lumbosacral spinal cord</BrainRegion> that innervate the pelvic viscera. Together, we propose that the <BrainRegion>medial preoptic</BrainRegion>(MPO) --&amp;gt; <BrainRegion>periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion>(PAG) --&amp;gt; <BrainRegion>nucleus paragigantocellularis</BrainRegion>(nPGi) circuit forms the final common pathway whereby <BrainRegion>medial preoptic</BrainRegion>(MPO) neural output results in the initiation and maintenance of male copulatory reflexes.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>The <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> projection of the <BrainRegion>basolateral amygdaloid nucleus</BrainRegion> in the rat: a retrograde fluorescent dye study.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The fluorescent dye, retrograde labeling technique was used to determine the extent of the projection from the <BrainRegion>basolateral nucleus of the amygdala</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>neocortex</BrainRegion> in the rat. Each rat received a single <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> injection of fast blue, and in one-half of the animals, a subsequent injection of nuclear yellow was placed in a different <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> region. An analysis of the results demonstrates that the projection to the <BrainRegion>midline cortex</BrainRegion> arises in the medial neurons within the <BrainRegion>caudal two-thirds of the basolateral nucleus</BrainRegion>. This projection is directed to the <BrainRegion>anterior cingulate cortex</BrainRegion>, but not to the <BrainRegion>posterior cingulate cortex</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>primary motor cortex</BrainRegion> receives a <BrainRegion>basolateral amygdala</BrainRegion> projection which originates from neurons in two areas, (1) the medial part of the anterior one-third of the nucleus and (2) the center (in the lateral to medial axis) portion of the posterior two-thirds of the nucleus. The latter neurons are situated lateral to the neurons projecting to the <BrainRegion>cingulate cortex</BrainRegion>. <BrainRegion>Somatosensory cortex</BrainRegion> injections label many fewer <BrainRegion>basolateral nucleus</BrainRegion> neurons than do <BrainRegion>motor cortex</BrainRegion> injections, but these neurons are located in a position similar to that of those labeled by <BrainRegion>motor cortex</BrainRegion> injections. Finally the <BrainRegion>gustatory cortex</BrainRegion>, which lies just dorsal to the <BrainRegion>rhinal sulcus</BrainRegion>, receives a basolateral projection from neurons in the <BrainRegion>lateroventral one-half of the basolateral nucleus</BrainRegion>. These results demonstrate that the <BrainRegion>basolateral nucleus</BrainRegion> gives rise to a rather widespread and topographically organized projection to the <BrainRegion>anterior half of the neocortex</BrainRegion> of the rat.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Scanning and transmission electron microscope studies of interkinetic nuclear migration in the cerebral vesicles of the rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>A scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to examine the morphology and surface texture of neuroepithelial cells during interkinetic nuclear migration in the cerebral vesicles of the rat at 12, 13 and 14 days of gestation. Serial sections of embryonic material of the same age were also prepared for the transmission electron microscope (TEM). Particular attention was paid to the scanning electron microscope(SEM) and transmission electron microscope(TEM) appearance of mitotic neuroepithelial cells which occur exclusively along the ventricular border of the neural epithelium. Three distinctly-shaped classes of mitotic cells were recognised in scanning micrographs. (1) Pyriform cells. This type of mitotic cell was characterised by the presence of very long, fine processes radiating from the tip and shoulders of a short external (basal) process. These fine processes were termed &quot;intramitotic filopodia." Microvilli were found on the surface of most pyriform cells. (2) Conical cells. These lacked an external process but there were large numbers of intramitotic filopodia at the basal pole of the cell body, and the perikaryal surface was rich in microvilli. (3) Globular cells. It was possible to subdivide this class of cell into large and small sizes, but usually a few short intramitotic filopdia were present at the basal pole. The perikaryal surfaces of the globular population were raised in coarse lumps and bubble-like protrusions. By pooling transmission electron microscope(TEM) and scanning electron microscope(SEM) information we were able to deduce that pyriform cells probably possess a prophase or prometaphase chromosome morphology, while conical cells exhibit a chromosome morphology somewhere between prometaphase and early anaphase. Large globular mitotic cells were found to be between metaphase and late anaphase and small globular cells were identified as early telophase cells. On the basis of these findings we have proposed that as a bipolar neuroepithelial cell rounds up for mitosis it passes first through a pyriform stage during which the external process is retracted or broken down, and then through a conical stage when the cell consolidates its position on the ventricular surface. Finally, the cell enters a large globular stage before dividing into two small globular telophase cells. It is not known what part, if any, the intramitotic filopodia play in this process of rounding up.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Analysis of neuritic outgrowth from severed giant axons in Lumbricus terrestris.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>This study analyzes the detailed morphometric pattern at various postoperative times of neuritic outgrowths from the proximal and distal stumps of two uniquely identifiable axons. Morphological patterns of neuritic outgrowths from stumps of severed axons were compared for medial and lateral giant axons in the central nervous system of the earthworm Lumbricus terrestris. Outgrowths from proximal and distal stumps were labeled by injection of fluorescent dye into axonal stumps and assessed according to morphometric parameters. Outgrowths from axonal stumps of severed giant axons were statistically indistinguishable for most morphometric measures of neuritic quantity, shape, direction, and location. There were two exceptions to this general rule: 1) proximal stumps of medial giant axons produced significantly more neurites than distal stumps of medial giant axons, and 2) proximal stumps of lateral giant axons produced significantly longer neurites than proximal stumps of medial giant axons. No measure of neuritic outgrowth showed a significant change from the second through seventh postoperative week, suggesting that most outgrowth occurred in the first two postoperative weeks and that neuritic morphology remained stable through the seventh postoperative week. Neurites grew across the lesion site in relatively straight trajectories parallel to the longitudinal axis of the ventral nerve cord and often grew alongside the appropriate axonal stump across the lesion site. The length of neurites growing in close apposition to appropriate axonal stumps or giant axons was much greater than expected, had outgrowth been randomly directed. These data provide a basis for future investigations of the mechanisms that regulate neuritic outgrowth.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Ultrastructure of normal and degenerating glomerular terminals of dorsal root axons in the substantia gelatinosa of the rhesus monkey.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The fine structure of primary sensory terminals within glomerular complexes of lamina II of Rexed (substantia gelatinosa Rolandi) in the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> was investigated in normal adult rhesus monkeys and in monkeys subjected to thoracic or lumbosacral dorsal root transection. Three types of &quot;scalloped" primary sensory terminals were distinguished on the basis of their ultrastructural characteristics, size, and distribution of synaptic vesicle population: (1) dense sinusoid axon (DSA) terminals contain medium-sized (42--46 nm and 58--62 nm) and large (80 nm) clear synaptic vesicles; (2) large dense-core vesicles (LDCV) terminals are equipped with empty synaptic vesicles ranging from 30 to 106 nm, large, (80 nm) and very large, (100 nm) dense-core vesicles; and (3) regular synaptic vesicles (RSV) terminals contain a homogeneous population of 45--50 nm clear synaptic vesicles. Following transection of the dorsal roots, all three types of primary afferents degenerate and become engulfed and phagocytosed by glial cells. However, each type of terminal displays a different mode and tempo of degeneration as seen in monkeys sacrificed 36, 48, and 72 hours following rhizotomy. dense sinusoid axon(DSA) s follow the osmiophilic degeneration pattern; large dense-core vesicles(LDCV) s are characterized by a gradual increase in the number of "electron-dense bodies" and, less frequently, by a progressive osmiophilic process; regular synaptic vesicles(RSV) s exhibit signs of a filamentous degeneration, accompanied by clusters of synaptic vesicles. The three types of terminals are distributed in an overlapping but distinct pattern within the <BrainRegion>posterior horn</BrainRegion>. Thus dense sinusoid axon(DSA) s are present in highest numbers in lamina II where they constitute the most frequent terminal type. large dense-core vesicles(LDCV) s also occur in lamina II in its outer half but are most concentrated in lamina I. regular synaptic vesicles(RSV) s predominate in the deeper layers of the <BrainRegion>dorsal horn</BrainRegion> (lamina III) but are also found in the internal half of lamina II. On the basis of these ultrastructural data and a comparison with afferent profiles impregnated according to the Golgi method, it appears that dense sinusoid axon(DSA) s and large dense-core vesicles(LDCV) s correspond respectively to superficial and marginal collaterals of small, thin dorsal root fibers whereas regular synaptic vesicles(RSV) s represent terminals of deep collaterals from large, thick dorsal root axons.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Lamina I spinocervical tract terminations in the <BrainRegion>medial part of the lateral cervical nucleus</BrainRegion> in the cat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The terminations of spinocervical tract fibers in the <BrainRegion>lateral cervical nucleus</BrainRegion> (LCN) of the cat were examined with anterogradely transported Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) in order to analyze their organization relative to the most medial part and the main body (the lateral two-thirds) of the <BrainRegion>lateral cervical nucleus</BrainRegion>(LCN) , which have differential projections and physiological characteristics. Iontophoretic injections of Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin(PHA-L) in laminae I-V of the <BrainRegion>spinal dorsal horn</BrainRegion> yielded dense labeling in somatotopically appropriate regions of the main body of the <BrainRegion>lateral cervical nucleus</BrainRegion>(LCN) , and, as seen previously with horseradish peroxidase, additional terminations were present in the <BrainRegion>medial lateral cervical nucleus</BrainRegion>(LCN) after injections at either <BrainRegion>cervical or lumbar spinal levels</BrainRegion>. The morphological characteristics of the Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin(PHA-L) labeling in these two parts of the <BrainRegion>lateral cervical nucleus</BrainRegion>(LCN) were different. Terminations in the lateral <BrainRegion>lateral cervical nucleus</BrainRegion>(LCN) consisted of dense clusters of thick fibers bearing large numbers of boutons. The terminal axons in the <BrainRegion>medial part of the lateral cervical nucleus</BrainRegion>(LCN) displayed a reticulated network of longitudinally oriented, fine fibers with well-spaced varicosities. Some of the fine fibers in the <BrainRegion>medial lateral cervical nucleus</BrainRegion>(LCN) appeared to be collaterals of thicker fibers that terminated in the <BrainRegion>lateral lateral cervical nucleus</BrainRegion>(LCN) . Injections of Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin(PHA-L) that were restricted to lamina I resulted in terminal labeling only in the <BrainRegion>medial lateral cervical nucleus</BrainRegion>(LCN) . The labeling was more sparse than that observed in the <BrainRegion>medial lateral cervical nucleus</BrainRegion>(LCN) after larger <BrainRegion>dorsal horn</BrainRegion> injections but displayed the same morphological characteristics. Lamina I terminations were seen in the <BrainRegion>medial lateral cervical nucleus</BrainRegion>(LCN) after cervical or lumbar injections on both the ipsilateral and contralateral sides. The Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin(PHA-L) observations were corroborated by the presence of many retrogradely labeled lamina I cells at both <BrainRegion>cervical and lumbar spinal levels</BrainRegion>, following injections of cholera toxin subunit b or rhodamine-labeled microspheres in the <BrainRegion>medial lateral cervical nucleus</BrainRegion>(LCN) . In addition, double-immunofluorescent labeling for Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin(PHA-L) and substance P was performed in a few cases, since substance P immunoreactivity is present in fibers in the <BrainRegion>medial lateral cervical nucleus</BrainRegion>(LCN) and also in cell bodies in lamina I; however, very few spinocervical fibers displayed immunoreactivity for both antigens. These observations indicate that the <BrainRegion>medial part of the lateral cervical nucleus</BrainRegion>(LCN) receives input from lamina I neurons, and probably from lamina III-V neurons as well, at <BrainRegion>cervical and lumbar spinal levels</BrainRegion>. The lamina I input to the <BrainRegion>medial lateral cervical nucleus</BrainRegion>(LCN) provides a basis for the small population of nociceptive neurons that differentiate the <BrainRegion>medial lateral cervical nucleus</BrainRegion>(LCN) . The lamina I input could also be responsible for the general inhibition of lateral <BrainRegion>lateral cervical nucleus</BrainRegion>(LCN) neurons by wide-field noxious stimulation, via activation of GABAergic interneurons in the <BrainRegion>medial lateral cervical nucleus</BrainRegion>(LCN) .(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Morphology of <BrainRegion>retinogeniculate</BrainRegion> terminals in the turtle, Pseudemys scripta elegans.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The <BrainRegion>dorsal lateral geniculate complex</BrainRegion> in turtles receives a bilateral, topographic projection from the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> and projects to the <BrainRegion>telencephalon</BrainRegion>. This study examined the morphology of individual <BrainRegion>retinogeniculate</BrainRegion> terminals that were filled with horseradish peroxidase by injections in the optic tract or <BrainRegion>optic tectum</BrainRegion>. A large number of <BrainRegion>retinogeniculate</BrainRegion> terminals were successfully filled and detailed drawings were prepared of 87 terminals. Terminals were classified into three types based on the size and number of varicosities in the terminal, and (if a terminal formed a spatially restricted arbor) the volume of the arbor. Type I <BrainRegion>retinogeniculate</BrainRegion> terminals form spatially restricted, large-volume arbors with a low density of large varicosities. Type II <BrainRegion>retinogeniculate</BrainRegion> terminals form small volume arbors with a high density of small varicosities. Type III <BrainRegion>retinogeniculate</BrainRegion> terminals, in contrast to types I and II, do not form spatially restricted arbors. Rather, they consist of sparsely branched axons that parallel the optic tract and contain scattered en passant varicosities. Plots of the distribution of different terminal types throughout the <BrainRegion>geniculate complex</BrainRegion> show that all three terminal types occur throughout the rostrocaudal and mediolateral extents of the complex. However, each terminal type has a preferential distribution with type II terminals being concentrated in the outer half of the neuropile, type I terminals in the inner half of the neuropile, and type III terminals in the cell plate. All three types can arise from axons that continue caudally to terminate in the <BrainRegion>tectum</BrainRegion>. These findings raise the possibility that various classes of <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> ganglion cells differ in their mode of termination within the <BrainRegion>geniculate complex</BrainRegion>, but the precise relation between the three types of <BrainRegion>retinogeniculate</BrainRegion> terminals and the classes of ganglion cells remains to be determined.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Ontogenetic organization of the FMRFamide immunoreactivity in the nervus terminalis of the lungfish, Neoceratodus forsteri.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The development of the nervus terminalis system in the lungfish, Neoceratodus forsteri, was investigated by using FMRFamide as a marker. FMRFamide immunoreactivity appears first within the brain, in the <BrainRegion>dorsal hypothalamus</BrainRegion> at a stage around hatching. At a slightly later stage, immunoreactivity appears in the olfactory mucosa. These immunoreactive cells move outside the <BrainRegion>olfactory organ</BrainRegion> to form the ganglion of the <BrainRegion>nervus terminalis</BrainRegion>. Immunoreactive processes emerge from the ganglion of the <BrainRegion>nervus terminalis</BrainRegion> in two directions, one which joins the <BrainRegion>olfactory nerve</BrainRegion> to travel to the brain and the other which courses below the brain to enter at the level of the <BrainRegion>preoptic nucleus</BrainRegion>. Neither the ganglion of the <BrainRegion>nervus terminalis</BrainRegion> nor the two branches of the <BrainRegion>nervus terminalis</BrainRegion> form after surgical removal of the <BrainRegion>olfactory placode</BrainRegion> at a stage before the development of FMRFamide immunoreactivity external to the brain. Because this study has confirmed that the <BrainRegion>nervus terminalis</BrainRegion> in lungfish comprises both an anterior and a posterior branch, it forms the basis for discussion of homology between these branches and the <BrainRegion>nervus terminalis</BrainRegion> of other anamniote vertebrates.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Spinal cord</BrainRegion>-projecting vasopressinergic neurons in the rat <BrainRegion>paraventricular hypothalamus</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The <BrainRegion>paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus</BrainRegion> (PVH) is a key structure for the maintenance of homeostasis. Homeostatic regulation includes modulation of signaling in the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>. This may be exerted by neurons in the <BrainRegion>paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>(PVH) with <BrainRegion>spinal</BrainRegion> projections. However, the <BrainRegion>paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>(PVH) is not a homogeneous structure, but consists of anatomically and functionally distinct subdivisions. In this study, we have analyzed the distribution of <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>-projecting <BrainRegion>paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>(PVH) neurons that express vasopressin, an important neuropeptide in autonomic regulation. Vasopressinergic neurons were identified with a radiolabeled riboprobe complementary to vasopressin mRNA combined with immunohistochemical labeling of retrogradely transported cholera toxin subunit b in <BrainRegion>spinally</BrainRegion> projecting neurons. More than 40% of the <BrainRegion>spinally</BrainRegion> projecting neurons in the <BrainRegion>paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>(PVH) of naive Sprague-Dawley rats were found to express vasopressin mRNA. The <BrainRegion>lateral parvocellular subdivision</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>ventral part of the medial parvocellular subdivision</BrainRegion> contained the densest distribution of <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>-projecting vasopressin mRNA-expressing neurons. The <BrainRegion>magnocellular subdivisions</BrainRegion> displayed large numbers of vasopressin mRNA-expressing neurons, but very few of those projected to the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>dorsal parvocellular subdivision</BrainRegion> contained a large number of <BrainRegion>spinally</BrainRegion> projecting neurons, but very few of those expressed vasopressin mRNA. These findings show that the <BrainRegion>paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>(PVH) gives rise to a major vasopressinergic projection to the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> and that the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>-projecting vasopressinergic neurons are parceled into anatomically distinct cell groups. This provides an anatomical basis for a selective activation of functionally different groups in the <BrainRegion>paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>(PVH) as part of a behaviorally adaptive response, including modulation of autonomic activity and pain processing at the <BrainRegion>spinal</BrainRegion> level.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Myelin stains reveal an anatomical framework for the representation of the digits in <BrainRegion>somatosensory area 3b</BrainRegion> of macaque monkeys.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Brain sections cut parallel to the <BrainRegion>cortical surface</BrainRegion> revealed myelin-light septa that isolated representations of the digits and parts of the face, teeth, and tongue in <BrainRegion>area 3b</BrainRegion> of adult and infant macaque monkeys. The widths of the bands of cortex representing individual digits, as measured by the distances between isolating septa, were proportionally similar in infant (2-4 week) and adult monkeys. However, the bands for digits 1-3 were somewhat narrower in infant than adult monkeys. There was little variation in absolute widths across individuals in the infant or adult groups, or between left and right hemispheres of the same group. Widths for digits 1-4 progressively decreased. The results suggest that these isomorphs of digits emerge in prenatal or early postnatal development and typical variations in postnatal hand use have little impact on subsequent development. As the hand representation in <BrainRegion>somatosensory cortex</BrainRegion> of monkeys may be significantly altered after the partial loss of peripheral nerve inputs, the physiological representation is not completely constrained by the isolating septa. Instead, the septa may serve as a persistent marker of normal organization in studies of cortical reorganization.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>A reticular pattern of intrinsic connections in primate <BrainRegion>area V2</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>area 18</BrainRegion>).</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>A system of periodic intrinsic connections is demonstrated in <BrainRegion>area V2</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>area 18</BrainRegion>) of squirrel and macaque monkeys by large injections of tritiated amino acids, horseradish peroxidase (HRP), and fluorescent latex beads. These connections originate from pyramidal neurons concentrated in layers 3 and 5. Terminations occur in all <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> layers, largely coextensive with labeled neurons but more restricted in layer 4. This multilaminar distribution contrasts with the mainly supragranular localization of periodic intrinsic connections in <BrainRegion>V1</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>area 17</BrainRegion>), and may imply a close interaction, in <BrainRegion>V2</BrainRegion>, of periodic intrinsic connections with <BrainRegion>pulvinocortical</BrainRegion>, as well as with corticocortical terminations (concentrated, respectively, in layers 3 and 5, and in lower 3 and 4). As in <BrainRegion>V1</BrainRegion>, the tangential configuration of these connections in <BrainRegion>V2</BrainRegion> is reticular or latticelike, and is detectable for 2.5-3.0 mm from an injection site of horseradish peroxidase(HRP) , 3H amino acids, or latex beads. Cross-sectional widths of labeled regions vary from 250 to 800 micron in squirrel monkey and from 400 to 1,000 micron in macaque, depending on which portion of the lattice is measured. When periodic intrinsic connections are compared with stripes labeled histochemically by cytochrome oxidase (CO), no clear relationship is obvious between the two systems. This result contrasts with the orderly tangential alignment reported between cytochrome oxidase(CO) -reactive zones in <BrainRegion>V2</BrainRegion> and certain extrinsic connections; namely, <BrainRegion>pulvinocortical</BrainRegion> terminations (Livingstone and Hubel, &apos;82) and clusters of neurons projecting to <BrainRegion>area V4</BrainRegion> (DeYoe and Van Essen, &apos;84). Other extrinsic connections, however, such as backgoing connections from <BrainRegion>V2</BrainRegion> to <BrainRegion>V1</BrainRegion>, do not seem to have a periodic distribution. Thus, although some discontinuous <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> connections relate to each other in a precise mosaic fashion, intrinsic and some extrinsic connections may observe different modes of organization.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Organization of visual corticostriatal projections in the cat, with observations on visual projections to <BrainRegion>claustrum</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>amygdala</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Electrophysiological mapping criteria were employed to identify visual <BrainRegion>areas 20a</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>20b</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>21a</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>21b</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>PMLS</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>AMLS</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>ALLS</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>PLLS</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>DLS</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>VLS</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>PS</BrainRegion> in the cat, and to guide placement of tracer deposits. Anterograde tracer methods were used to study the corticostriatal projections of these <BrainRegion>extrastriate visual areas</BrainRegion>. The experiments demonstrate that all 11 <BrainRegion>extrastriate areas</BrainRegion> send projections to two distinct regions within the <BrainRegion>striatum</BrainRegion>, an extensive longitudinal zone within the <BrainRegion>caudate nucleus</BrainRegion>, and a more compact region within the <BrainRegion>posterolateral putamen</BrainRegion>. <BrainRegion>Cortical</BrainRegion> visual projections to the <BrainRegion>putamen terminate</BrainRegion> in relatively compact sheets or slabs, and appear to overlap extensively, while those to the <BrainRegion>caudate nucleus</BrainRegion> are irregularly patchy and more widely dispersed. Retrograde tracer deposits into the visual recipient zone of the <BrainRegion>caudate nucleus</BrainRegion> reveal substantial convergence of other <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> inputs to this same domain. Aspects of visuotopic organization are preserved in the visual projections to both the <BrainRegion>putamen</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>caudate nucleus</BrainRegion>, but unequivocal retinotopic organization could not be inferred from the available material. Ten of the eleven <BrainRegion>extrastriate visual area</BrainRegion> also project topographically onto the <BrainRegion>visual zone of the claustrum</BrainRegion>. <BrainRegion>Area PS</BrainRegion> does not appear to contribute to the corticoclaustral projections. Five of the <BrainRegion>extrastriate visual areas</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>ALLS</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>PLLS</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>DLS</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>VLS</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>PS</BrainRegion>) also send sparse projections to the <BrainRegion>amygdaloid complex</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Brainstem</BrainRegion> afferents to the <BrainRegion>omnipause region</BrainRegion> in the cat: a horseradish peroxidase study.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>&quot;Omnipause" neurons (OPNs), located in the <BrainRegion>nucleus raphe pontis</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>reticular formation</BrainRegion>, actively suppress saccadic eye movements during intersaccadic intervals. To determine the <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion> afferents that may inhibit the OPNs and thereby allow a saccade to occur, we injected horseradish peroxidase into the <BrainRegion>raphe pontis</BrainRegion> of four cats at the site of physiologically identified OPNs. Labeled neurons were found in a number of <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion> nuclei. The greatest concentrations, composed of small to medium-sized neurons, were located in a group of nuclei around the habenulopeduncular tract, in the <BrainRegion>rostral mesencephalic reticular formation</BrainRegion>, in the deep layers of the <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion>, and in parts of the subjacent cuneiform and subcuneiform <BrainRegion>reticular nuclei</BrainRegion>. Smaller numbers were found in the <BrainRegion>nucleus reticularis pontis oralis</BrainRegion>. Caudal to the injection site, labeled neurons were scattered in parts of the <BrainRegion>nuclei reticularis gigantocellularis</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>paragigantocellularis dorsalis</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>paragigantocellularis lateralis</BrainRegion>. A few neurons were labeled in a restricted region of the causal part of the <BrainRegion>nucleus prepositus hypoglossi</BrainRegion> and in the <BrainRegion>nucleus reticularis medullaris ventralis</BrainRegion>. Larger numbers of neurons were labeled in the <BrainRegion>dorsal column nuclei</BrainRegion> and in parts of the <BrainRegion>cochlear nuclei</BrainRegion>. Smaller numbers were found in the <BrainRegion>spinal trigeminal nucleus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>lateral nucleus of the superior olive</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>fastigial nucleus of the cerebellum</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>nonreticular brainstem</BrainRegion> projections may contribute sensory information in a number of modalities since OPNs respond to visual, somesthetic, and auditory stimuli. Our findings indicate a number of regions that may contain neural elements impinging on the OPNs. The best prospects for a saccade initiation signal from one of the labeled populations appear to be the <BrainRegion>meso-diencephalic reticular formation</BrainRegion> and/or the <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Transforming growth factor-beta and bone morphogenetic proteins: cooperative players in chick and murine programmed <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> cell death.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) are extracellular molecules known to mediate programmed cell death (PCD) in the developing <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>. In the present study, we investigated the expression profiles and activity levels of ligands and receptors of the Transforming growth factor-beta(TGF-beta) and bone morphogenetic protein(BMP) 4 family during the physiological programmed cell death(PCD) periods of the developing chick and mouse <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> and possible interactions of both proapoptotic molecules in mediating apoptosis in chick and murine <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> whole-mount cultures. Immunocytochemical double-labeling studies with the established ganglion cell marker Islet revealed overlapping expression patterns for Transforming growth factor-beta(TGF-beta) and bone morphogenetic protein(BMP) 4 ligands and receptors on the surface of retinal ganglion cells. The biphasic peak of activity and expression levels of Transforming growth factor-beta(TGF-beta) and bone morphogenetic protein(BMP) 4 ligands and receptors, revealed by Western blots and mink lung epithelial cell (MLEC) assays, coincided with the two main periods of <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> chick and murine programmed cell death(PCD) . In organotypic <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> cultures, we were able to increase apoptosis over basal levels by application of recombinant Transforming growth factor-beta(TGF-beta) or bone morphogenetic protein(BMP) 4. Double-factor treatment induced an additional increase of apoptosis, suggesting a cooperation of both proapoptotic pathways. A significant increase in the number of apoptotic cells in the ganglion cell layer was observed in a TUNEL staining of <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> whole mounts treated with recombinant Transforming growth factor-beta(TGF-beta) or bone morphogenetic protein(BMP) 4, suggesting a concerted action of both factors in triggering ganglion cell death. Blockage experiments revealed that both pathways do not interact at the ligand, receptor, or Smad protein level but converge at the transcriptional level of the Transforming growth factor-beta(TGF-beta) immediate-early response gene TIEG and the transcriptional coactivator Gcn5.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Chemosensory anterior dorsal fin in rocklings (Gaidropsarus and Ciliata, Teleostei, Gadidae): somatotopic representation of the ramus recurrens facialis as revealed by transganglionic transport of HRP.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The anterior dorsal fin in rocklings consists of a fringe of 50-80 delicate, vibratile rays, which are densely beset with epidermal chemosensory cells. The innervation of these cells is from the dorsal branch of the <BrainRegion>recurrent facial nerve</BrainRegion>, which also innervates all other fins and the skin of the trunk. This nerve carries at least three classes of fibres: small (0.5-1.5 micron in diameter), medium (1.5-4 micron), and large (greater than 4 micron). Approximately 12,000 small and weakly myelinated nerve fibres from the <BrainRegion>recurrent facial nerve</BrainRegion> innervate the anterior dorsal fin organ. Application of HRP at different locations of the recurrent facial nerve labelled three different sizes of sensory perikarya within the geniculate ganglion--small (6-15 micron in diameter), medium (18-24 micron), and large (greater than 25 micron)--which corresponds to the different size classes of fibres present within the nerve. Retrograde transganglionic transport of HRP revealed somatotopy within the <BrainRegion>brainstem facial lob</BrainRegion>e: the delicate nerve fibres innervating the chemosensory anterior dorsal fin terminate exclusively in a distinct, dorsal portion of the <BrainRegion>facial lobe</BrainRegion>. Fibres innervating the posterior dorsal fin, the anal and caudal fins, as well as the skin of the trunk terminate within caudal and dorsal areas of the <BrainRegion>ventral facial lobe</BrainRegion>; pectoral and pelvic fins are represented in the ventral and caudal portions of the <BrainRegion>ventral facial lobe</BrainRegion>. Innervation by a distinct type of fibre and exclusive representation within a distinct, dorsal part of the <BrainRegion>facial lobe</BrainRegion> may indicate a peculiar biological role in the anterior dorsal fin chemosensory organ in the rocklings.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Epidermal growth factor-dependent enhancement of axonal regeneration in the pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis: role of phagocyte survival.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Peripheral nerve injury triggers complex responses from neuronal as well as from multiple nonneuronal cell types. These responses are coordinated by a wide spectrum of secreted and nonsecreted factors, including growth factors, cytokines, and cell adhesion molecules. These molecules originate from different sources and act both locally at the site of injury as well as centrally at the location of the neuronal cell bodies. One of the signal systems frequently implicated in this process is the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family and its receptors. Expression of members of this family as well as that of epidermal growth factor(EGF) -receptors is upregulated in different cell types after peripheral nerve injury. However, the functional significance of this response is unclear. Using a simple invertebrate model system (Lymnaea stagnalis), the present study implicates the epidermal growth factor(EGF) / epidermal growth factor(EGF) -receptor system in the survival of ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1)-positive phagocytes that reside in the nervous system. We show that inhibiting the epidermal growth factor(EGF) -signaling pathway enhances cell death in this type of cell, an effect paralleled by a substantial reduction in axonal regeneration. Therefore, complementing our previous observation that Lymnaea epidermal growth factor(EGF) provides trophic support to axotomized neurons, the present results emphasize the significance of nonneuronal actions of epidermal growth factor(EGF) receptor ligands in axonal regeneration. Thus, we add a novel perspective to the ongoing discussion on the functional significance of the epidermal growth factor(EGF) signaling system in the injury responses of the nervous system.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Anatomical organization of efferent neurons innervating various regions of the rabbit masseter muscle.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Previous studies have shown that the masseter muscle is supplied by motoneurons located in the <BrainRegion>anterodorsal region of the trigeminal motor nucleus</BrainRegion> and by an additional group of efferent neurons located in cell group k. The present experiments were performed on nine rabbits and were designed to establish the locations of neurons innervating the different regions of this muscle. Retrograde labeling with two fluorescent tracers (FluoroGold and Fast Blue) was applied to the central ends of cut branches of the masseter nerve. Serial coronal sections of the <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion> were viewed with fluorescence microscopy. The labeled cells were counted in all animals, and three-dimensional reconstructions of their distribution were made in five cases. In each successful experiment, labeled neurons were seen in the <BrainRegion>anterodorsal region of the trigeminal motor nucleus</BrainRegion> and in the two dorsal cell columns of cell group k (k1 and k3). Within-animal comparisons of the median position of populations innervating two distinct muscle regions in five rabbits showed that there were no significant differences in either the dorsoventral or rostrocaudal axes. However, in each case, there was a small but significant difference (83-173 microm) in the mediolateral axis within the <BrainRegion>motor nucleus</BrainRegion> but not within cell group k. Even in this axis, there was a 94-99% overlap of the two populations. Comparisons of the neuronal cross-sectional area showed that the deep regions were innervated by a larger proportion of small neurons from both nuclei than were the superficial and intermediate regions. Our results suggest that there is no simple topographical arrangement of motoneurons that corresponds to the peripheral pattern of nerve supply to the different regions of the masseter muscle.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Distribution of cholinergic neurons in rat brain: demonstrated by the immunocytochemical localization of choline acetyltransferase.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The neuroanatomical location and cytological features of cholinergic neurons in the rat brain were determined by the immunocytochemical localization of the biosynthetic enzyme, choline acetyltransferase (ChAT). Perikarya labeled with choline acetyltransferase(ChAT) were detected in four major cell groups: (1) the <BrainRegion>striatum</BrainRegion>, (2) the <BrainRegion>magnocellular basal nucleus</BrainRegion>, (3) the <BrainRegion>pontine tegmentum</BrainRegion>, and (4) the <BrainRegion>cranial nerve motor nuclei</BrainRegion>. Labeled neurons in the <BrainRegion>striatum</BrainRegion> were observed scattered throughout the <BrainRegion>neostriatum</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>caudate</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>putamen</BrainRegion>) and associated areas (<BrainRegion>nucleus accumbens</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>olfactory tubercle</BrainRegion>). Larger choline acetyltransferase(ChAT) -labeled neurons were seen in an extensive cell system which comprises the <BrainRegion>magnocellular basal nucleus</BrainRegion>. This more or less continuous set of neuronal clusters consists of labeled neurons in the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the diagonal band</BrainRegion> (horizontal and vertical limbs), the <BrainRegion>magnocellular preoptic nucleus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>substantia innominata</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>globus pallidus</BrainRegion>. Labeled neurons in the <BrainRegion>pontine tegmentum</BrainRegion> were seen as a group of large neurons in the <BrainRegion>caudal midbrain</BrainRegion>, dorsolateral to the most caudal part of the <BrainRegion>substantia nigra</BrainRegion>, and extended in a caudodorsal direction through the midbrain <BrainRegion>reticular formation</BrainRegion> into the area surrounding the <BrainRegion>superior cerebellar peduncle</BrainRegion>. The neurons in this latter group constitute the <BrainRegion>pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus</BrainRegion> (PPT). An additional cluster of cells was observed medially adjacent to the <BrainRegion>pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus</BrainRegion>(PPT) , in the lateral part of the <BrainRegion>central gray matter</BrainRegion> at the rostral end of the <BrainRegion>fourth ventricle</BrainRegion>. This group corresponds to the <BrainRegion>laterodorsal tegmental nucleus</BrainRegion>. Large choline acetyltransferase(ChAT) -labeled neurons were also observed in all <BrainRegion>somatic and visceral motor nerve nuclei</BrainRegion>. The correspondence of the distribution of choline acetyltransferase(ChAT) -labeled neurons identified by our methods to earlier immunocytochemical and acetylcholinesterase histochemical studies and to connectional studies of these groups argues for the specificity of the choline acetyltransferase(ChAT) antibody used.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Glial cells stabilize axonal protoglomeruli in the developing <BrainRegion>olfactory lobe</BrainRegion> of the moth Manduca sexta.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Odor information is processed in spherical structures called glomeruli, which in all animals with differentiated olfactory systems are sites of densely spaced synaptic contacts between <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> sensory axons and target central nervous system (CNS) neurons. Glomerulus development in the <BrainRegion>antennal (olfactory) lobe</BrainRegion> of the moth brain, which is initiated by the arrival of antennal receptor axons, requires interaction among three elements: glial cells, receptor axons, and their targets, the antennal-lobe neurons. Receptor axons form an array of protoglomeruli that become surrounded by glia and serve as a template for mature glomeruli. Previous experiments showed that when the number of glial cells is sharply reduced during development either by irradiation or by an anti-mitotic agent, receptor axons form protoglomeruli, but in the mature lobes, glomeruli are absent and central neurons lack the characteristic glomerular tufting of their arbors. The current investigation was conducted to determine which cellular events in the process of glomerulus formation are disrupted by severe reduction in glial-cell number. The branching patterns of receptor axons and antennal-lobe neurons were examined in animals that had been irradiated to produce glia-deficient antennal lobes at stages during which glomeruli normally would develop. We found that the receptor axons did form protoglomeruli, but that the protoglomeruli quickly disintegrated in glia-deficient antennal lobes; the receptor axons branched diffusely, except where several neighboring glia survived irradiation and together formed a wall of processes that appeared to block the passage of neuronal processes. Multi-glomerular antennal-lobe neurons never developed tufted arbors even at early stages. These results suggest that maintenance of protoglomeruli depends on the border of glia that forms around each protoglomerulus and that the subsequent tufting of <BrainRegion>antennal-lobe</BrainRegion> neurons depends on maintenance of the protoglomerular template during the period of dendritic growth.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Serotoninergic and nonserotoninergic neurons in the <BrainRegion>medullary raphe</BrainRegion> system have axon collateral projections to autonomic and somatic cell groups in the <BrainRegion>medulla</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Fluorescent double retrograde-tracing studies combined with fluorescent immunostaining for serotonin were carried out to determine the potential patterns of divergence in axonal projections to autonomic and somatic motor sites from <BrainRegion>medullary raphe</BrainRegion> and parapyramidal neurons. Injections (20-60 nl) of combinations of fluorescent retrograde tracers (Fast Blue, fluoro-gold, green latex microspheres, Diamidino Yellow) were made into the <BrainRegion>intermediolateral cell column (IML) of the spinal cord</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>brainstem lateral tegmental field</BrainRegion> or <BrainRegion>ventral horn of the lumbar spinal cord</BrainRegion> of male Wistar rats. The animals were perfused after a 7-10-day survival period, and the brains were removed, sectioned (50 microns), and immunostained for serotonin. Following injections of different retrograde-tracer substances into the <BrainRegion>intermediolateral cell column(IML) of the thoracic cord</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>ventral horn of the lumbar cord</BrainRegion>, 36% of the neurons with axon collateral projections to the <BrainRegion>intermediolateral cell column</BrainRegion>(IML) and the <BrainRegion>lumbar ventral horn</BrainRegion> were serotoninergic. Following injections of different retrograde-tracer substances into the <BrainRegion>intermediolateral cell column</BrainRegion>(IML) and the <BrainRegion>lateral tegmental field</BrainRegion>, 26% of the neurons with axon collateral projections to the <BrainRegion>intermediolateral cell column</BrainRegion>(IML) and the <BrainRegion>lateral tegmental field</BrainRegion> were serotoninergic. Many of the <BrainRegion>medullary</BrainRegion> neurons with projections to the <BrainRegion>lateral tegmental field</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>lumbar cord</BrainRegion> were located dorsal and lateral to those neurons with projections to the <BrainRegion>intermediolateral cell column</BrainRegion>(IML) . The results indicate that serotoninergic and nonserotoninergic neurons of the midline raphe system and parapyramidal region have axon collateral branches to the <BrainRegion>intermediolateral cell column</BrainRegion>(IML) and the <BrainRegion>lateral tegmental field</BrainRegion> or the <BrainRegion>intermediolateral cell column</BrainRegion>(IML) and the <BrainRegion>lumbar ventral horn</BrainRegion>. These projection neurons may form the anatomical substrate for the integration of autonomic and somatic motor activity.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Spinal</BrainRegion> termination patterns of canine identified A-delta and C spermatic polymodal receptors traced by intracellular labeling with Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The <BrainRegion>spinal</BrainRegion> projection patterns of spermatic polymodal receptors were studied by intracellular labeling of functionally identified canine dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons with Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin (PHA-L). The processes of 2 C-fiber and 1 A-delta-fiber spermatic polymodal receptor neurons were labeled well enough to trace their central terminations. The labeled C-fiber dorsal root ganglion(DRG) neurons were of medium size (mean diameter 36.8 and 40.7 microns). On entering the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>, axons of the C-polyclonal receptors divided into rostral and caudal main branches that extended over 3 spinal segments (20 and 25 mm, respectively), and issued a total of 16 and 15 collaterals, respectively. The majority of collaterals ran in or along the lateral surface, but both neurons had 1 or 2 collaterals or terminal branches running through the middle, or along the medial surface of the dorsal horn. Terminal swellings and en passant enlargements were observed mainly in laminae I, V, and VII. Some C-fiber terminations appeared in lamina II and the adjacent lateral column. The A-delta polymodal receptor had a termination pattern similar to that of the C-fiber units with the exception of a shorter distance over which its 13 identified collaterals were issued (10 mm), and continuation of the rostral main branch into Lissauer&apos;s tract (traced for 3.6 mm) after all branches appeared. Two terminal branches were found running just above the <BrainRegion>central canal</BrainRegion> in another A-delta neuron in which termination could be only partially traced.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Distribution of GABAergic neurons and terminals in the auditory system of the barn owl.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Antisera to GAD (glutamic acid decarboxylase) and GABA were used to determine the distribution of GABAergic cells and terminals in the <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion> and midbrain <BrainRegion>auditory nuclei</BrainRegion> of the barn owl. The owl processes time and intensity components of the auditory signal in separate pathways, and each pathway has a distinctive pattern of glutamic acid decarboxylase(GAD) - and GABA-like immunoreactivity. In the time pathway, all the cells of the <BrainRegion>cochlear nucleus magnocellularis</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>nucleus laminaris</BrainRegion> receive perisomatic GABAergic terminals, and small numbers of GABAergic neurons surround both nuclei. The <BrainRegion>ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus</BrainRegion> (anterior division) contains both immunoreactive terminals and some GABAergic neurons. In the intensity pathway, dense immunoreactive terminals are distributed throughout the <BrainRegion>cochlear nucleus angularis</BrainRegion>, which also contains a small number of GABAergic neurons. The <BrainRegion>superior olive</BrainRegion> contains two GABAergic cell types and immunoreactive terminals distributed throughout the neuropil. All the neurons of the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the lateral lemniscus</BrainRegion> (ventral part) appear to be GABAergic, and this nucleus also contains a moderate number of immunoreactive terminals. Immunoreactive terminals are distributed throughout the neuropil of the <BrainRegion>ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus</BrainRegion> (posterior division), whereas multipolar and small fusiform GABAergic neurons predominate in the dorsal regions of the nucleus. The time and intensity pathways combine in the <BrainRegion>inferior colliculus</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>central nucleus of the inferior colliculus</BrainRegion> contains a larger number of fusiform and stellate GABAergic neurons and a dense plexus of immunoreactive terminals, whereas the external nucleus contains slightly fewer immunoreactive cells and terminals. The <BrainRegion>superficial nucleus</BrainRegion> contains dense, fine immunoreactive terminals and a small number of GABAergic neurons.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Recurrent excitation of granule cells with basal dendrites and low interneuron density and inhibitory postsynaptic current frequency in the <BrainRegion>dentate gyrus</BrainRegion> of macaque monkeys.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText><BrainRegion>Temporal lobe</BrainRegion> epilepsy is often associated with pathological changes in the <BrainRegion>dentate gyrus</BrainRegion>, and such changes may be more common in humans than in some nonprimate species. To examine species-specific characteristics that might predispose the <BrainRegion>dentate gyrus</BrainRegion> to epileptogenic damage, we evaluated recurrent excitation of granule cells with and without basal dendrites in macaque monkeys, measured miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) of granule cells in macaque monkeys and compared them to rats, and estimated the granule cell-to-interneuron ratio in macaque monkeys and rats. In <BrainRegion>hippocampal</BrainRegion> slices from monkeys, whole-cell patch recording revealed antidromically evoked excitatory PSCs that were four times larger and inhibitory PSCs that were over two times larger in granule cells with basal dendrites than without. These findings suggest that granule cells with basal dendrites receive more recurrent excitation and, to a lesser degree, more recurrent inhibition. Miniature IPSC amplitude was slightly larger in monkey granule cells with basal dendrites than in those without, but mIPSC frequency was similar and only 26% of that reported for rats. In situ hybridization for glutamic acid decarboxylase and immunocytochemistry for somatostatin, parvalbumin, and neuronal nuclei revealed interneuron proportions and distributions in monkeys that were similar to those reported for rats. However, the interneuron-to-granule cell ratio was lower in monkeys (1:28) than in rats (1:11). These findings suggest that in the primate <BrainRegion>dentate gyrus</BrainRegion>, recurrent excitation is enhanced and inhibition is reduced compared with rodents. These primate characteristics may contribute to the susceptibility of the human <BrainRegion>dentate gyrus</BrainRegion> to epileptogenic injuries.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Aminergic and cholinergic afferents to REM sleep induction regions of the <BrainRegion>pontine reticular formation</BrainRegion> in the rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Microinjection of cholinergic agonists in a dorsolateral part of the <BrainRegion>mesopontine tegmentum</BrainRegion> has been shown to induce a rapid eye movement (REM) sleep-like state. Physiological evidence indicates that not only acetylcholine but also various amine transmitters, including those implicated in behavioral state regulation, affect neuronal activity in this region of the <BrainRegion>pontine reticular formation</BrainRegion>. In the present study, sources of select aminergic and cholinergic inputs to this rapid eye movement(REM) sleep induction zone were identified and quantitatively analyzed by using fluorescence retrograde tracing combined with immunofluorescence in the rat. In addition to previously demonstrated cholinergic projections from the <BrainRegion>pedunculopontine and laterodorsal tegmental nuclei</BrainRegion>, the rapid eye movement(REM) sleep induction zone received various aminergic inputs that originated in widely distributed regions of the <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion>. Serotoninergic afferents represented a mean of 44% of all aminergic/cholinergic source neurons projecting to the rapid eye movement(REM) sleep induction zone, which was comparable to the mean percentage of 39% represented by cholinergic afferent neurons. The serotoninergic afferents originated from the <BrainRegion>raphe nuclei</BrainRegion> at all <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion> levels, with heavier projections from the <BrainRegion>pontine</BrainRegion> than from the <BrainRegion>medullary raphe nuclei</BrainRegion>. Unexpectedly, an additional major serotoninergic input was provided by serotoninergic neurons in the <BrainRegion>nucleus prosupralemniscus</BrainRegion> (B9). Noradrenergic afferent neurons represented a mean of 14% of all aminergic/cholinergic source neurons, which was only about one-third of the mean percentage of either cholinergic or serotoninergic source neurons. These noradrenergic projection neurons were located not only in the <BrainRegion>locus ceruleus</BrainRegion> (8%) but also in the <BrainRegion>lateral tegmentum</BrainRegion>, including the A5 (4%) and A7 (2%) cell groups. Histaminergic neurons in the tuberomammillary <BrainRegion>hypothalamic nucleus</BrainRegion> represented a minor group of afferent neurons (3%), and a still smaller input came from adrenergic C1 neurons. The pattern of these transmitter-specific afferent connections appeared to be similar regardless of the longitudinal level within the rapid eye movement(REM) sleep induction zone. The present results are consistent with previous behavioral and physiological evidence for a role of the <BrainRegion>pontine</BrainRegion> rapid eye movement(REM) sleep induction zone in triggering rapid eye movement(REM) sleep. The regulation of rapid eye movement(REM) sleep induction would be best understood in terms of a state-dependent interplay of cholinergic, serotoninergic, and other inputs all acting convergently upon neurons in the rapid eye movement(REM) sleep-inducing region of the <BrainRegion>pontine reticular formation</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Morphological classes of <BrainRegion>spinothalamic</BrainRegion> lamina I neurons in the cat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>We examined the morphology and distribution of retrogradely labeled spinothalamic tract (STT) neurons in lamina I (the marginal zone) of the <BrainRegion>spinal dorsal horn</BrainRegion> after large injections of cholera toxin subunit B (CTb) or Fast Blue (FB) into the <BrainRegion>contralateral thalamus</BrainRegion> of cats. Based on the shape and orientation of the somata and proximal dendrites in horizontal sections, three distinct cell types were identified: (1) fusiform cells with small, spindle-shaped somata and bipolar, longitudinal dendritic arbors; (2) pyramidal cells with triangular somata and three main dendritic origins with primarily longitudinal arborizations; and (3) multipolar cells with larger, multiangular somata and four or more radiating dendritic arbors directed both longitudinally and mediolaterally. These three morphological types differed significantly in the number of primary dendrites and the size of the somata. Subclasses of multipolar cells were noted. Nearly all cells could be categorized into these three classes consistently in horizontal sections. A small number of cells with transitional shapes or with small, round somata were unclassified. The proportional distributions of these cell types were found to vary over the length of the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> (from the third cervical through the coccygeal segments) in three cats. The overall proportions of cell types were 34% fusiform, 36% pyramidal, 25% multipolar, and 5% unclassified. The proportions of pyramidal and multipolar cells were strikingly higher within the C7-8 and L6-7 segments and lowest in the thoracic segments. In contrast, fusiform cells formed about 20% of the labeled lamina I spinothalamic tract(STT) population in the C7-8 and L6-7 segments but more than 60% in thoracic segments. Across all nine cats, the proportions were similar within the cervical (C5-8) and lumbosacral (L5-S1) enlargements, although considerable interanimal variability was noted. These distinct morphological types of lamina I spinothalamic tract(STT) cells with differential longitudinal distributions probably have different functional roles. They may correspond to the three main physiological classes of lamina I spinothalamic tract(STT) cells.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Postembedding immunocytochemistry for GABA and glycine reveals the synaptic relationships of the dopaminergic amacrine cell of the cat <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Postembedding electron microscope immunocytochemistry of glycine and GABA conjugated to colloidal gold has been applied to pre-embedded cat <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> stained with the antibody against tyrosine hydroxylase (Toh+). tyrosine hydroxylase(Toh+) + stained cells are the equivalent of A18 amacrine cells of Golgi descriptions (Kolb et al., &apos;81). The dendrites of tyrosine hydroxylase(Toh+) + cells synapse upon several different types of glycine-positive amacrine cell bodies. We suggest that these are the A8, A3/A4, and AII amacrine cell varieties by analogous immunocytochemical staining intensity, to glycine autoradiographic labeling intensity (Pourcho and Goebel, '85). The greatest number of synapses from tyrosine hydroxylase(Toh+) + dendrites are directed at the least glycine-positive amacrine, which is the AII cell by all morphological criteria. A few glycine-positive profiles are also presynapatic to the tyrosine hydroxylase(Toh+) + stained cell body itself. tyrosine hydroxylase(Toh+) + profiles are also presynaptic to GABA-positive amacrine cell bodies. The commonest amacrine synapsed upon is very heavily labeled with GABA immunocytochemistry. We consider it to be the A17 amacrine cell, which is known to label strongly by [3H] muscimol autoradiography (Pourcho and Goebel, '83). The cell body of the tyrosine hydroxylase(Toh+) + amacrine cell also receives many synapses, which appear to be GABA-positive, and tyrosine hydroxylase(Toh+) + profiles running in stratum 1 of the inner plexiform layer (IPL) are both pre- and postsynaptic to GABA-positive amacrine cell profiles. In addition, the cell body and primary dendrites of the tyrosine hydroxylase(Toh+) + cell receive input from a bipolar type and GABA- or glycine-negative profiles. GABA-positive profiles, belonging to the interplexiform cell (IPC), are synapsed upon by tyrosine hydroxylase(Toh+) + profiles that run in the outer plexiform layer (OPL).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>The <BrainRegion>vestibular complex</BrainRegion> of the American opossum, Didelphis virginiana. I. Conformation, cytoarchitecture and primary vestibular input.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Degeneration experiments reveal that the <BrainRegion>vestibular nerve</BrainRegion> of the adult opossum distributes to an extensive and diverse area of the <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion> and, as in placental mammals, the traditionally named nuclei do not receive a uniform distribution of primary afferent fibers. Nevertheless, such nuclei as well as other nearby cell groups have been considered as vestibular since they share other mutual connections. Except for subgroups &quot;l", "g" and the <BrainRegion>nucleus supravestibularis</BrainRegion> all of the vestibular subdivisions generally recognized in more specialized placentals (e.g., the cat) have been identified in the marsupial opossum. Each of the <BrainRegion>vestibular nuclei</BrainRegion> and &quot;extra-nuclear" cell stations are described as to their boundaries, cytoarchitecture and dendritic domain. Whenever possible we have employed a terminology consistent with that used for the cat. In several instances we have used results from experimental degeneration material to identify nuclear boundaries and divisions which are not apparent in routine Nissl, Golgi or silver preparations.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Effect of temperature on long-term survival of anucleate giant axons in crayfish and goldfish.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The effect of temperature on the electrophysiology and morphology of anucleate axons was examined following severance of crayfish medial giant axons and goldfish Mauthner axons from their respective cell bodies. Although anucleate segments of each giant axon exhibited long-term survival for weeks to months at 5-25 degrees C in crayfish and 10-30 degrees C in goldfish, the two axons differed in their survival characteristics. All measures of long-term survival in crayfish medial giant axons were independent of animal holding temperature, whereas all measures in Mauthner axons were dependent on holding temperature. Medial giant axons survived for at least 90 days in crayfish maintained at 5-25 degrees C in this and previous studies. Mauthner axons survived for over 5 months in goldfish maintained at 10 degrees C but survived for 1 month at 30 degrees C. Postoperative time had different effects on many single measures of long-term survival (axonal diameter, amplitude of action or resting potentials) in medial giant axons compared to Mauthner axons. For example, resting and action potentials in crayfish medial giant axons remained remarkably constant at all holding temperatures for 0-90 postoperative days. In contrast, resting and action potentials in goldfish Mauthner axons declined abruptly in the first 10-20 postoperative days followed by a slower decline at each holding temperature. We suggest that the mechanism of long-term survival is not necessarily the same in all anucleate axons.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Regeneration of <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> axons into the goldfish <BrainRegion>optic tectum</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The growth of regenerating <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> axons into the central portion of the <BrainRegion>optic tectum</BrainRegion> of adult goldfish was examined with the light and electron microscopes. Optic tracts were cut and, two days to five months later, the animals were perfused and the <BrainRegion>tecta</BrainRegion> prepared for microscopy. Regenerating axons first reached central regions of the <BrainRegion>tectum</BrainRegion> seven to ten days postoperatively. Regenerating axons appear in very large numbers and travel in fascicles in the <BrainRegion>stratum opticum</BrainRegion> (SO) and in the adjacent neuropil, the <BrainRegion>stratum fibrosum et griseum superficiale</BrainRegion> (SFGS). In the <BrainRegion>stratum opticum</BrainRegion>(SO) , the fascicles are bordered by glial cells and degenerating debris. Within the <BrainRegion>stratum fibrosum et griseum superficiale</BrainRegion>(SFGS) , however, the fascicles do not seem to be similarly associated with glial cells and degenerating debris. The youngest regenerating axons are very slender processes, containing microtubules but few or no neurofilaments or dense granular material. By 10 to 14 days postoperatively, neurofilaments can be seen and, in addition, large numbers of vesicles with dense cores appear. The vesicles with dense cores increase in numbers until about 28 days postoperatively and then become quite rare. That vesicles with dense cores were seen in regenerating axons in both <BrainRegion>stratum opticum</BrainRegion>(SO) and <BrainRegion>stratum fibrosum et griseum superficiale</BrainRegion>(SFGS) during the period of growth into the <BrainRegion>tectum</BrainRegion> but were not seen in axon terminals at any time, suggests that they may be concerned with axon elongation. During the period one month to five months postoperatively, the regenerating axons gradually increase in diameter but do not reach preoperative sizes, suggesting that the regenerative changes may still be occurring. Remyelination is delayed and proceeds slowly. Many axons remain unmyelinated for as long as five months postoperatively.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Distribution of prepro-nociceptin/orphanin FQ mRNA and its receptor mRNA in developing and adult mouse central nervous systems.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Nociceptin/orphanin FQ (N/OFQ) and its receptor share similarities to opioids and their receptors in terms of the molecular structure and signaling pathway, but the two systems exhibit different actions in vivo. To understand the mechanism of Nociceptin/orphanin FQ(N/OFQ) -system actions, we examined, by in situ hybridization analysis, the distribution of prepro Nociceptin/orphanin FQ(N/OFQ) and Nociceptin/orphanin FQ(N/OFQ) receptor mRNAs in the developing and adult mouse central nervous systems (CNS). In most neural regions, prepro Nociceptin/orphanin FQ(N/OFQ) mRNA was mainly expressed in a small population of middle-sized neurons. These neurons were scattered between large projection-type neurons or within the neuropil, suggestive of interneurons. In some other nuclei (<BrainRegion>lateral septum</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>bed nucleus of the stria terminalis</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>reticular thalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>inferior colliculus</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>rostral periolivery nucleus</BrainRegion>), prepro Nociceptin/orphanin FQ(N/OFQ) mRNA was expressed in a number of large projection-type neurons. By contrast, Nociceptin/orphanin FQ(N/OFQ) receptor mRNA was evenly expressed in most neurons of the adult central nervous systems(CNS) . Considering the inhibitory actions of Nociceptin/orphanin FQ(N/OFQ) , the distinct cellular expression pattern of the Nociceptin/orphanin FQ(N/OFQ) system suggests that the release of Nociceptin/orphanin FQ(N/OFQ) from interneurons may lower neuronal and synaptic activities of neighboring neurons, leading to integration or modulation of local circuits. Furthermore, the cellular expression pattern, distinct from that of the opioid system, may provide a possible molecular/cellular basis for the different in vivo actions of Nociceptin/orphanin FQ(N/OFQ) and opioids. In embryonic stages, both prepro Nociceptin/orphanin FQ(N/OFQ) and Nociceptin/orphanin FQ(N/OFQ) receptor mRNAs were highly and widely expressed in the mantle zone, suggesting the possible importance of Nociceptin/orphanin FQ(N/OFQ) signaling in central nervous systems(CNS) development.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Dynorphin-immunoreactive terminals in the rat <BrainRegion>nucleus accumbens</BrainRegion>: cellular sites for modulation of target neurons and interactions with catecholamine afferents.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Dynorphin facilitates conditioned place aversion and reduces locomotor activity through mechanisms potentially involving direct activation of target neurons or release of catecholamines from afferents in the <BrainRegion>nucleus accumbens</BrainRegion>. We examined the ultrastructural substrates underlying these actions by combining immunoperoxidase labeling for dynorphin 1-8 and immunogold silver labeling for the catecholamine synthesizing enzyme, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). The two markers were simultaneously visualized in single coronal sections through the rat <BrainRegion>nucleus accumbens</BrainRegion>. By light microscopy, dynorphin immunoreactivity was seen as patches of immunoreactive varicosities throughout all <BrainRegion>rostrocaudal levels of the nucleus accumbens</BrainRegion>. The dynorphin-immunoreactive terminals identified by electron microscopy ranged from 0.2 to 1.5 microns in cross-sectional diameter, contained numerous small (30-40 nm) clear vesicles, as well as one or more large (80-100 nm) dense core vesicles. From the dynorphin-immunoreactive terminals quantitatively examined in single sections, 74% (173/370) showed symmetric synaptic junctions mainly with large unlabeled dendrites. Of the dynorphin-immunoreactive terminals forming identifiable synapses, approximately 30% contacted more than one dendritic target. In addition, single dendrites frequently received convergent input from more than one dynorphin-labeled terminal. Irrespective of their dendritic associations, dynorphin-immunoreactive terminals also frequently showed close appositions with other axons and terminals; these included unlabeled (41%), tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) -labeled (10%) or dynorphin-labeled axons (14%). In contrast to dynorphin-immunoreactive terminals, tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) -labeled terminals formed primarily symmetric synapses with small dendrites and spines or lacked recognizable specializations in the plane of section analyzed. In some cases, single dendrites were postsynaptic to both dynorphin and tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) -immunoreactive terminals. We conclude that dynorphin-immunoreactive terminals potently modulate, and most likely inhibit, target neurons in both subregions of the rat <BrainRegion>nucleus accumbens</BrainRegion>. This modulatory action could attenuate or potentiate incoming catecholamine signals on more distal dendrites of the <BrainRegion>accumbens</BrainRegion> neurons. The findings also suggest potential sites for presynaptic modulatory interactions involving dynorphin and catecholamine or other transmitters in apposed terminals.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Accessory optic system of an anthropoid primate, the gibbon (Hylobates concolor): evidence of a direct <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> input to the <BrainRegion>medial terminal nucleus</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The accessory optic system (AOS) was studied in an anthropoid primate by using anterograde transport of tritiated amino acids and autoradiographic techniques. The course of the accessory optic tract (AOT) and the <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> projection to the <BrainRegion>terminal nuclei</BrainRegion> are described in the gibbon and compared to that of other mammals. The accessory optic tract(AOT) consists of a superior fasciculus, which includes both an anterior and a posterior fiber branch. An inferior fasciculus of the accessory optic tract(AOT) is absent. In contrast to previous reports in haplorhine primates, which describe the accessory optic system(AOS) as consisting of only the <BrainRegion>dorsal (DTN) and the lateral (LTN) terminal nuclei</BrainRegion>, we find that in the gibbon, three cellular groups receive a bilateral projection, predominantly from the <BrainRegion>contralateral retina</BrainRegion>. According to cytoarchitecture and topographic location, two of these nuclei correspond to the <BrainRegion>DTN</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>LTN</BrainRegion>. The third cellular group, situated <BrainRegion>dorsomedial to the substantia nigra</BrainRegion>, receives a distinct <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> projection and extends rostrocaudally for 2.0 mm in the <BrainRegion>mesencephalon</BrainRegion>. This nucleus is homologous to the <BrainRegion>dorsal division of the medial terminal nucleus</BrainRegion> (MTN) in other mammals. There was no evidence for a ventral division of the <BrainRegion>medial terminal nucleus</BrainRegion>(MTN) , which in nonprimates is typically situated at the <BrainRegion>ventromedial base of the cerebral peduncle</BrainRegion>. Examination of brain morphology in primates suggests that the <BrainRegion>ventral division of the medial terminal nucleus</BrainRegion>(MTN) has been displaced from its phylogenetically stable location in the <BrainRegion>medial part of the ventral midbrain</BrainRegion> to a more dorsal position. This shift appears to be a consequence of the overall morphological influences resulting from the relative enlargement of the <BrainRegion>pons</BrainRegion> in this region. The demonstration of a direct <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> projection to the <BrainRegion>medial terminal nucleus</BrainRegion>(MTN) in the gibbon, as well as recent reports in other primates, indicates that a complete accessory optic system(AOS) consisting of three <BrainRegion>terminal nuclei</BrainRegion> is a feature common to all mammals.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Telencephalic</BrainRegion> connections of the trigeminal system in the pigeon (Columba livia): a trigeminal sensorimotor circuit.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>A combination of autoradiography and horseradish peroxidase histochemistry was used to identify <BrainRegion>telencephalic structures</BrainRegion> linking the sensory and motor components of the trigeminal system in the pigeon. A direct <BrainRegion>telencephalic</BrainRegion> projection from the <BrainRegion>principal trigeminal sensory nucleus</BrainRegion> upon the <BrainRegion>nucleus basalis</BrainRegion> via the quintofrontal tract was confirmed. <BrainRegion>Nucleus basalis</BrainRegion> projects upon a belt of neurons within the overlying <BrainRegion>neostriatum</BrainRegion>. This region (<BrainRegion>neostriatum frontale, pars trigeminale</BrainRegion>: NFT) gives rise to the fronto-archistriate tract which terminates both in the <BrainRegion>archistriatum intermedium</BrainRegion> and in the overlying <BrainRegion>neostriatum caudale</BrainRegion>, medial to the ventricle (<BrainRegion>neostriatum caudale, pars trigeminale</BrainRegion>: NCT). <BrainRegion>NCT</BrainRegion> projects, in turn, upon a region of <BrainRegion>archistriatum intermedium</BrainRegion> containing cell bodies of the occipito-mesencephalic tract. This pathway provides a link between the <BrainRegion>telencephalon</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>premotor areas</BrainRegion> within the <BrainRegion>lateral (parvicellular) reticular formation</BrainRegion> of the <BrainRegion>lower brainstem</BrainRegion>. The trigeminal sensorimotor circuit defined in these experiments has been implicated by neurobehavioral studies in the control of pecking, grasping, and feeding in the pigeon.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Organization and morphologies of acetylcholinesterase-containing neurons in the <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion> of the rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The distribution and morphologies of neurons containing acetyl cholinesterase (AChE, EC 3.1.1.7) in the <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion> of the rat were studied by means of a pharmaco-histochemical technique involving staining for acetyl cholinesterase(AChE) (Karnovsky-Roots&apos; procedure) at various times after administration of bis-(u-methylethyl)phosphorofluoridate. This method enables visualization of individual acetyl cholinesterase(AChE) -containing neuronal somata and their processes to a degree not possible with other protocols for the enyzme. The strongest acetyl cholinesterase(AChE) activity occurring at the level of the <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion> is found within the small, round to oval, somata of <BrainRegion>nucleus anterior dorsalis</BrainRegion>. Most of the <BrainRegion>intralaminar nuclei</BrainRegion>, as well as <BrainRegion>nucleus reticularis</BrainRegion>, are composed of medium-sized multipolar neurons displaying moderate to strong acetyl cholinesterase(AChE) activity. Moderately stained acetyl cholinesterase(AChE) neurons are also found in <BrainRegion>pars ventralis of nucleus geniculatus lateralis</BrainRegion> and in <BrainRegion>pars lateralis of nucleus habenularis</BrainRegion>. Most of the neurons of the <BrainRegion>lateral and posterior thalamic territories</BrainRegion>, however, are nearly devoid of acetyl cholinesterase(AChE) . At the level of the <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion>, the neurons of <BrainRegion>nuclei supraoptics and paraventricularis</BrainRegion> show strong acetyl cholinesterase(AChE) activity. The acetyl cholinesterase(AChE) neurons of <BrainRegion>nucleus supraopticus</BrainRegion> are surrounded by numerous acetyl cholinesterase(AChE) -containing processes of some large <BrainRegion>lateral preoptic area</BrainRegion> neurons that stain intensely for the enzyme. Numerous intensely stained acetyl cholinesterase(AChE) perikarya occur in the <BrainRegion>lateral, dorsal, and supra-mammillary hypothalmic areas</BrainRegion>. These neurons often possess several acetyl cholinesterase(AChE) -containing processes. <BrainRegion>Nuclei arcuatus and ventomedialis</BrainRegion> consist mainly of neurons displaying a weak to moderate intensity of acetyl cholinesterase(AChE) staining. At the level of the mamillary bodies most neurons show moderate acetyl cholinesterase(AChE) activity except the neuronal somata of <BrainRegion>nucleus mammillaris lateralis</BrainRegion> which stain very strongly for the enzyme.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Sprouting of serotoninergic afferents into <BrainRegion>striatum</BrainRegion> after dopamine-depleting lesions in infant rats: a retrograde transport and immunocytochemical study.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Intraventricular injections of 6-hydroxydopamine in 3-day-old rats resulted in the near-total loss of tyrosine-hydroxylase-immunoreactive processes in the <BrainRegion>striatum</BrainRegion> when examined 2-6 months later. This destruction of dopamine (DA) afferents was accompanied by an increase in the density of serotonin (5-HT)-immunoreactive fibers in the <BrainRegion>striatum</BrainRegion>. The hyperinnervation was most striking in the <BrainRegion>rostral striatum</BrainRegion>, an area containing few 5-HT-immunoreactive fibers in control rats. Retrograde tracing, with either horse-radish peroxidase or rhodamine-labelled microspheres, indicated a significant increase in the number of neurons projecting to the <BrainRegion>rostral striatum</BrainRegion> from the <BrainRegion>dorsal raphe nucleus</BrainRegion> of lesioned animals. The increase was largely confined to the rostral extent of the <BrainRegion>dorsal raphe</BrainRegion>, and overlapped the distribution of cells labelled after injections of HRP into <BrainRegion>caudal striatum</BrainRegion> of control and lesioned animals. In sections additionally processed for immunocytochemistry, 80-90% of retrogradely labelled <BrainRegion>raphe</BrainRegion> neurons in both groups of animals were found to be 5-HT-immunoreactive. None of changes encountered in infant-lesioned rats were observed 2-4 weeks after 6-H dopamine(DA) was given to adult animals. These findings demonstrate that removal of dopamine(DA) afferents during development leads to an enlargement of the serotoninergic projection from the <BrainRegion>raphe nucleus</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>striatum</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Organization of <BrainRegion>auditory cortex</BrainRegion> in the owl monkey (Aotus trivirgatus).</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The region of cerebral cortex in the owl monkey that is responsive to acoustic stimulation is located on the dorsal and lateral surfaces of the rostral half of the <BrainRegion>superior temporal gyrus</BrainRegion>. Systematic microelectrode mapping of this area has revealed multiple frequency representations. The boundaries of these fields determined electrophysiologically correlate with the architectural boundaries apparent in Nissl stained material. On the basis of combined cytoarchitectonic and electrophysiological maps we have divided <BrainRegion>auditory cortex</BrainRegion> into five fields. Two of them, the primary field (AI) and the field rostral to it (R) are somewhat similar architectonically and constitute the central core of <BrainRegion>auditory cortex</BrainRegion>. Each of these two fields has a complete and orderly representation of the audible frequency spectrum within it. Surrounding these fields is a belt of <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion> in which units are generally less responsive to acoustic stimulation and the frequency organization is more complex than in AI or R. Electrophysiological and cytoarchitectonic evidence suggest that this belt is composed of at least three and possibly four separate <BrainRegion>auditory fields</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Unilateral LTP triggers bilateral increases in <BrainRegion>hippocampal</BrainRegion> neurotrophin and trk receptor mRNA expression in behaving rats: evidence for interhemispheric communication.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the <BrainRegion>dentate gyrus</BrainRegion> of awake rats triggered a rapid (2 hour) elevation in tyrosine kinase receptor (trkB and trkC) gene expression and a delayed (6-24 hour) increase in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) gene expression. Depending on the mRNA species, long-term potentiation(LTP) induction led to highly selective unilateral or bilateral increases in gene expression. Specifically, trkB and neurotrophin-3(NT-3) mRNA elevations were restricted to granule cells in the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral dentate gyrus</BrainRegion>, whereas bilateral increases in trkC, brain-derived neurotrophic factor(BDNF) , and nerve growth factor (NGF) mRNA levels occurred in granule cells and <BrainRegion>hippocampal</BrainRegion> pyramidal cells. Both unilateral and bilateral changes in gene expression were N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-dependent and long-term potentiation(LTP) -specific. Bilateral electrophysiological recordings demonstrated that long-term potentiation(LTP) was unilaterally induced; this was corroborated by a dramatic unilateral increase in the expression of the immediate early gene zif/268, a marker for long-term potentiation(LTP) , restricted to the ipsilateral granule cells. The results indicate that long-term potentiation(LTP) triggers an interhemispheric communication manifested as selective, bilateral increases in gene expression at multiple sites in the <BrainRegion>hippocampal network</BrainRegion>. Furthermore, our findings suggest that physiological plastic changes in the adult brain may involve coordinated, time-dependent regulation of multiple neurotrophin and trk receptor genes.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>A quantitative anatomical study of the granule cell dendritic fields of the rat <BrainRegion>dentate gyrus</BrainRegion> using a novel probabilistic method.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The granule cell dendritic fields of the adult rat <BrainRegion>dentate gyrus</BrainRegion> were analyzed quantitatively using a probabilistic method developed to correct dendritic length and segment number for dendrites cut during sectioning. Golgi-impregnated, linearized <BrainRegion>hippocampi</BrainRegion> were sectioned serially in one of the three <BrainRegion>hippocampal</BrainRegion> planes. Three dendritic field parameters were quantified from camera lucida drawings of these dendritic fields: dendritic field spread, dendritic length, and the branching and termination patterns of dendritic segments. Granule cell dendritic fields resembled cones, their maximal extent occurring in the distal third of the molecular layer. The ratio of transverse to longitudinal dendritic field spread was greater than 1:1 for the dorsal leaf and crest regions, but close to or less than 1:1 for the ventral leaf. The probabilities of segment branching and termination were highly similar for transversely and longitudinally sectioned tissue. The probability of branching varied among dendritic orders and across the molecular layer for the same order. The probability of termination did not vary greatly across orders. Most nonbranching segments terminated adjacent to the <BrainRegion>hippocampal fissure</BrainRegion>. On the average, a granule cell had 2.23 first-order dendrites that branched into a dendritic field containing seventh-order dendrites. Total dendritic length, corrected for cut dendrites and projection errors, averaged 3,662 +/- 88 microns. The somatic layer and proximal third of the molecular layer contained approximately 35% of this total length. The remainder, ca. 60%, was restricted to the distal two-thirds of the molecular layer, the predominant termination zone of perforant path axons. These data provide a quantitative characterization of the rat granule cell dendritic fields. Implementation of the probabilistic correction method overcomes methodological problems common to quantitative Golgi studies. These data permit a more precise relationship to be drawn between dendritic architecture and granule cell physiology.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Damage of serotonergic axons and immunolocalization of Hsp27, Hsp72, and Hsp90 molecular chaperones after a single dose of MDMA administration in Dark Agouti rat: temporal, spatial, and cellular patterns.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, &quot;ecstasy") causes long-term disturbance of the serotonergic system. We examined the temporal, spatial, and cellular distribution of three molecular chaperones, Hsp27, Hsp72, and Hsp90, 3 and 7 days after treatment with 7.5, 15, and 30 mg/kg single intraperitoneal (i.p.) doses of MDMA in Dark Agouti rat brains. Furthermore, we compared the immunostaining patterns of molecular chaperones with serotonergic axonal-vulnerability evaluated by tryptophan-hydroxylase (TryOH) immunoreactivity and with astroglial-activation detected by GFAP-immunostaining. There was a marked reduction in TryOH-immunoreactive axon density after MDMA treatment in all examined areas at both time points. Three days after treatment, a significant dose-dependent increase in Hsp27-immunoreactive protoplasmic astrocytes was found in the <BrainRegion>cingulate, frontal, occipital, and pyriform cortex</BrainRegion>, and in the <BrainRegion>hippocampus CA1</BrainRegion>. However, there was no increase in astroglial Hsp27-immunoreactivity in the <BrainRegion>caudate putamen</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>lateral septal nucleus</BrainRegion>, or <BrainRegion>anterior hypothalamus</BrainRegion>. A significant increase in the GFAP immunostaining density of protoplasmic astrocytes was found only in the <BrainRegion>hippocampus CA1</BrainRegion>. In addition, numerous strong Hsp72-immunopositive neurons were found in some brain areas only 3 days after treatment with 30 mg/kg MDMA. Increased Hsp27-immunoreactivity exclusively in the examined <BrainRegion>cortical areas</BrainRegion> reveals that Hsp27 is a sensitive marker of astroglial response to the effects of MDMA in these regions of Dark Agouti rat brain and suggests differential responses in astroglial Hsp27-expression between distinct brain areas. The co-occurrence of Hsp27 and GFAP response exclusively in the <BrainRegion>hippocampus CA1</BrainRegion> may suggest the particular vulnerability of this region. The presence of strong Hsp72-immunopositive neurons in certain brain areas may reflect additional effects of MDMA on nonserotonergic neurons.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Macaque monkey <BrainRegion>retrosplenial cortex</BrainRegion>: I. three-dimensional and cytoarchitectonic organization.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>This is the first in a series of reports on the neuroanatomic organization and connectivity of the macaque monkey <BrainRegion>retrosplenial cortex</BrainRegion>, i.e., <BrainRegion>areas 29</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>30</BrainRegion>. To elucidate the topographic configuration of the <BrainRegion>retrosplenial cortex</BrainRegion> and adjacent structures, we have made three-dimensional computer reconstructions of the <BrainRegion>posterior cingulate region</BrainRegion> that includes the <BrainRegion>retrosplenial cortex</BrainRegion>. The largest portion of the <BrainRegion>posterior cingulate gyrus</BrainRegion> is located dorsal to the <BrainRegion>corpus callosum</BrainRegion>. At the caudal limit of the <BrainRegion>corpus callosum</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>gyrus</BrainRegion> curves around the <BrainRegion>splenium</BrainRegion>, turns laterally and forms a region called the <BrainRegion>isthmus</BrainRegion> that links the <BrainRegion>cingulate and parahippocampal gyri</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>isthmus</BrainRegion> contains the <BrainRegion>caudomedial lobule</BrainRegion>, which is a rostrally oriented bulge that is made up, in part, of portions of the <BrainRegion>retrosplenial cortex</BrainRegion>. To delineate the subdivisions of the <BrainRegion>retrosplenial</BrainRegion> and adjacent <BrainRegion>cortices</BrainRegion>, we conducted a cytoarchitectonic analysis by using <BrainRegion>cerebral hemispheres</BrainRegion> that were cut at oblique angles and stained with a variety of techniques, including immunohistochemistry for nonphosphorylated neurofilament protein. The dorsal bank of the <BrainRegion>callosal sulcus</BrainRegion> and the rostral surface of the <BrainRegion>isthmus</BrainRegion> are covered by the <BrainRegion>retrosplenial cortical areas 29l</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>29m</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>30</BrainRegion>, whereas most of the medial surface of the <BrainRegion>posterior cingulate gyrus</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>ventral bank of the posterior cingulate sulcus</BrainRegion> consist of <BrainRegion>areas 23i</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>23e</BrainRegion>. The most caudoventral portion of the <BrainRegion>cingulate gyrus</BrainRegion> is composed of an area (<BrainRegion>area 23v</BrainRegion>) that resembles the <BrainRegion>retrosplenial and posterior cingulate cortices</BrainRegion> but has a much more prominent layer IV. On the <BrainRegion>dorsal bank of the calcarine sulcus</BrainRegion>, we also defined a transitional zone, <BrainRegion>area 30v</BrainRegion>, located between the <BrainRegion>retrosplenial cortex</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>prestriate visual cortex</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Septal organ of Grüneberg</BrainRegion> is part of the olfactory system.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The olfactory system in rodents and many other mammals is classically divided into two anatomically separate, and morphologically distinct, sensory systems: the main olfactory system and the accessory olfactory system. We have now identified a novel third population of olfactory marker protein-expressing sensory neurons that is located in a discrete pocket of the <BrainRegion>rostral nasal septum</BrainRegion>, which we refer to as the <BrainRegion>septal organ of Grüneberg</BrainRegion> (SOG). Neurons in this region of the <BrainRegion>septum</BrainRegion> are located in the <BrainRegion>submucosa</BrainRegion>, in small grape-like clusters, rather than in a pseudostratified neuroepithelium, as seen in both the olfactory and vomeronasal neuroepithelia. Despite their unusual location, axons projecting from the <BrainRegion>septal organ of Grüneberg</BrainRegion>(SOG) neurons fasciculate into several discrete bundles and terminate in a subset of <BrainRegion>main olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> glomeruli. These glomeruli most likely represent a subset of atypical glomeruli that are spatially restricted to the <BrainRegion>caudal main olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>. The unique rostral position of the <BrainRegion>septal organ of Grüneberg</BrainRegion>(SOG) suggests that the <BrainRegion>septal organ of Grüneberg</BrainRegion>(SOG) may be functionally specialized for the early detection of biologically relevant odorants.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Intrinsic Connections in the macaque <BrainRegion>inferior temporal cortex</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Intrinsic connections in the <BrainRegion>inferior temporal cortex</BrainRegion> were analyzed by making extracellular injections of biocytin in Japanese macaques. Analysis was focused mainly on the <BrainRegion>dorsal part of area TE</BrainRegion>, in which a functional columnar organization has been shown. Interlaminar connections were analyzed in coronal section after laminar-specific microinjections, and intralaminar connections were examined from tangential sections. After injections at various depths in the <BrainRegion>dorsal TE</BrainRegion>, both axons and cell bodies were strongly labeled above or below the injection site in a columnar appearance. Axons from layer 3 ran in bundles towards the white matter and gave off prominent collaterals in layer 5. Ascending axons from lower to upper layers were also present (e.g., layers 4, 5, and 6 to layer 3). In tangential sections, there were abundant axons running parallel to the <BrainRegion>pia mater</BrainRegion>. These horizontal axons, particularly those in layers 2 and 3, produced patches of terminals 0.5 +/- 0.1 mm (mean +/- s.d.) in size and cylindrical in shape, spanning layers 1-3 or even to layers 4 and 5. In the tangential plane, they were distributed in an anisotropic manner around the injection. The farthest patch appeared at 4 mm from the injection site. The center-to-center distance between nearest-neighbor patches was 0.7 +/- 0.3 mm. These patches were found only within the <BrainRegion>dorsal TE</BrainRegion> and did not extend into the lower bank of the <BrainRegion>superior temporal sulcus</BrainRegion> or into the ventral part of <BrainRegion>area TE</BrainRegion>. <BrainRegion>Area TEO</BrainRegion>, which is a major afferent source to <BrainRegion>area TE</BrainRegion>, had axonal patches with spacing similar to those in <BrainRegion>area TE</BrainRegion> but with smaller sizes (0.4 +/- 0.1 mm). The results show that intrinsic horizontal axons both in <BrainRegion>area TE</BrainRegion> and in <BrainRegion>area TEO</BrainRegion> arborize in a patchy manner, as has been reported for several other <BrainRegion>cortical areas</BrainRegion>. In are <BrainRegion>TE</BrainRegion>, the size and spacing of the terminal patches match those of columns with similar stimulus selectivity. Thus, these patches may be related to the functional modularity in <BrainRegion>area TE</BrainRegion>. Vertical connections across layers and cylindrical patches of horizontal axons most likely contribute to the shared stimulus selectivity among cells within a column.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Organization of the <BrainRegion>cerebellum</BrainRegion> in the pigeon (Columba livia): III. Corticovestibular connections with <BrainRegion>eye and neck premotor areas</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The connections of the <BrainRegion>cerebellar cortex</BrainRegion> with <BrainRegion>vestibular premotor</BrainRegion> neurons of the oculomotor and collimotor systems in the pigeon were delineated in experiments using WGA-HRP as an anterograde and retrograde tracer. Putative premotor neuron pools were identified by injections into the <BrainRegion>oculomotor (mIII) and trochlear nuclei</BrainRegion> (mIV) and into the most rostral portion of the <BrainRegion>cervical neck motor nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>nucleus supraspinalis</BrainRegion> (SSp). The retrograde data indicate that ipsilateral projections upon <BrainRegion>oculomotor</BrainRegion> neurons arise from the <BrainRegion>medial portions of the superior (VeS) and tangential (Ta) nuclei</BrainRegion>. Contralateral projections originate from the <BrainRegion>infracerebellar nucleus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>interstitial vestibular region</BrainRegion> including the <BrainRegion>main (lateral) portion of the tangential nucleus</BrainRegion>, and from the <BrainRegion>descending and medial vestibular nuclei</BrainRegion> (VeD, VeM). These projections were confirmed in anterograde studies that also defined the connections of these <BrainRegion>vestibular premotor regions</BrainRegion> with specific subnuclear divisions of the pigeon&apos;s <BrainRegion>&quot;oculomotor" nuclei</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>mIII</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>mIV</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>mVI</BrainRegion>). The organization of projections from the <BrainRegion>vestibular nuclei</BrainRegion> to the pigeon&apos;s extraocular motoneurons is similar to that reported in mammals. Projections upon <BrainRegion>neck premotor</BrainRegion> neurons arise primarily from neurons in the <BrainRegion>interstitial region of the vestibular nuclear complex</BrainRegion>. After injections in <BrainRegion>supraspinalis</BrainRegion>(SSp) , retrogradely labeled neurons were found, contralaterally, in the lateral part of the <BrainRegion>tangential and superior vestibular nuclei</BrainRegion> and in the <BrainRegion>dorsolateral vestibular nucleus</BrainRegion> (VDL). Ipsilateral labeling was seen in the <BrainRegion>medial interstitial region</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>VeM</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>VeD</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>medial tangential</BrainRegion>(Ta) ). These projections were confirmed in anterograde experiments. With the exception of <BrainRegion>VDL</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>vestibular nuclei</BrainRegion> projecting to neck motoneurons also project to extraocular motoneurons. Thus the <BrainRegion>infracerebellar nucleus</BrainRegion> projects exclusively, and the <BrainRegion>superior vestibular nucleus</BrainRegion> predominantly, upon <BrainRegion>oculomotor (mIII, mIV) nuclei</BrainRegion>; <BrainRegion>VDL</BrainRegion> projects predominantly upon the <BrainRegion>neck motor nucleus</BrainRegion>, whereas the <BrainRegion>interstitial vestibular regions</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>medial tangential</BrainRegion>(Ta) , <BrainRegion>rostral VeD</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>intermediate VeM</BrainRegion>) project upon both <BrainRegion>collimotor</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>oculomotor</BrainRegion> neurons. The pattern of retrograde labeling seen in the <BrainRegion>cerebellar cortex</BrainRegion> after injections into <BrainRegion>vestibular premotor nuclei</BrainRegion> was used to define the projections of specific <BrainRegion>cerebellar cortical</BrainRegion> zones upon <BrainRegion>vestibular eye and neck premotor</BrainRegion> neurons. Corticovestibular projections upon these regions arise from the <BrainRegion>auricle and lateral unfoliated cortex</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>posterior lobe</BrainRegion> components of <BrainRegion>cortical zones B and E</BrainRegion>, and from the <BrainRegion>vestibulocerebellum</BrainRegion>. Each of these <BrainRegion>cortical zones</BrainRegion> projects upon components of the <BrainRegion>vestibular nuclear complex</BrainRegion>, which are premotor to either <BrainRegion>oculomotor nuclei</BrainRegion> or <BrainRegion>collimotor nuclei</BrainRegion>. The hodological findings are related to the functional organization of the oculomotor and collimotor systems in the pigeon and compared with the mammalian data.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Development of cholinergic amacrine cells is visual activity-dependent in the postnatal mouse <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>In the present study, we used immunocytochemistry to study the temporal and spatial arrangement of mouse cholinergic amacrine cells during postnatal <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> development under normal light/dark cycles and during visual deprivation. Choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)-immunolabeled cells were detected in the neuroblastic layer (NBL) and in the ganglion cell layer (GCL) at postnatal day 0 (P0). Between P3-5, two characteristic cholinergic bands were clearly identified in the inner plexiform layer (IPL). The signal intensity of somas and processes progressively increased over the first 2 postnatal weeks. Around eye opening at P12, cholinergic neurons were mature-like. This early developmental process was not altered by visual deprivation. After eye opening, the space between the two cholinergic bands increased continuously and the spatial regularity index changed constantly, indicating that the cholinergic neurons possibly underwent refinement during later postnatal development. The changes occurring following eye opening were retarded by visual deprivation. The morphologies of photoreceptors, horizontal cells, recoverin-positive OFF-cone bipolar cells, rod bipolar cells, dopaminergic amacrine cells, and Müller cells appeared normal. Their stratification in the outer plexiform layer (OPL) and the inner plexiform layer(IPL) was not affected by visual deprivation. However, glial cells grew vertically across the entire thickness of dark-reared <BrainRegion>retinas</BrainRegion>. Our results suggest that the development of cholinergic neurons before eye opening is independent of the lighting conditions. Their development after eye opening is greatly impeded by visual deprivation. This visual activity-dependent phase of development may be a critical period for the maturation and synaptic wiring of cholinergic amacrine cells in the mammalian <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>The time of origin of neurons in the <BrainRegion>hippocampal region</BrainRegion> of the rhesus monkey.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The time of origin of neurons in the <BrainRegion>hippocampal region</BrainRegion> was determined in a series of rhesus monkeys, each of which had been exposed to a pulse of tritiated thymidine (3H-TdR) at a different time during ontogeny and sacrificed between the second and fifth month after birth. No heavily labeled cells were found in the <BrainRegion>hippocampal region</BrainRegion> of animals exposed to 3H-TdR before embryonic day 33 (E33). Exposure to 3H-TdR given at E36 labels a few neurons in the deepest layers of the <BrainRegion>entorhinal area</BrainRegion>, and 3H-TdR given at E38 labels a small number of neurons in all <BrainRegion>hippocampal subdivisions</BrainRegion>. Although the first neurons are generated almost simultaneously throughout the <BrainRegion>hippocampal region</BrainRegion>, the proliferation ceases at a different time in each subdivision. The last neurons destined for the <BrainRegion>entorhinal area</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>presubiculum</BrainRegion> are generated between E70 and E75, whereas the last <BrainRegion>parasubicular</BrainRegion> neurons are generated between E75 and E80. The production of neurons that form the <BrainRegion>subiculum</BrainRegion> ends about two weeks earlier, between E56 and E65. Within the <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion>, genesis of pyramidal cells ends between E70 and E80 in <BrainRegion>area CA1</BrainRegion>, between E56 and E65 in <BrainRegion>area CA2</BrainRegion>, between E65 and E80 in <BrainRegion>area CA1</BrainRegion>, between E56 and E65 in <BrainRegion>area CA2</BrainRegion>, between E65 and E70 in <BrainRegion>area CA3</BrainRegion>, and between E75 and E80 in <BrainRegion>area CA4</BrainRegion>. In contrast, the genesis of granule cells of the <BrainRegion>fascia dentata</BrainRegion> is considerably prolonged. It continues throughout the second half of gestation, declines steadily in the course of the first postnatal month, and tapers off during the next 2 months. There is a distinct inside-to-outside spatiotemporal gradient in the <BrainRegion>parahippocampal formation</BrainRegion> and in the <BrainRegion>stratum pyramidale</BrainRegion> of both the <BrainRegion>subiculum</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion>. In contrast, the spatiotemporal pattern of granule cell origin in the <BrainRegion>dentate gyrus</BrainRegion> is outside-to-inside. Furthermore, granule cells generated between E36 and E80 are distributed in a distinct suprapyramidal-to-infrapyramidal gradient, whereas those generated at later ages are distributed evenly throughout the <BrainRegion>fascia dentata</BrainRegion>. Correlation of the present findings with histological data on <BrainRegion>hippocampal</BrainRegion> neurogenesis in the human brain demonstrates that the timing and sequence of developmental events as well as spatiotemporal gradients are similar in both primate species.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Prenatal exposure to ethanol alters the postnatal development and transformation of radial glia to astrocytes in the <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Postmitotic neurons migrate from a zone(s) near the <BrainRegion>ventricles</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>neocortex</BrainRegion>. During this migration, neurons associate with radial glia. After serving their role as guides for neuronal migration, the radial glia transform into astrocytes. Prenatal exposure to ethanol causes abnormal neuronal migration. We examined the effects of gestational exposure to ethanol on radial glia and astrocytes. Radial glia were stained immunohistochemically with the antibody RAT-401, and astrocytes were labeled with an antibody directed against glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). The subjects were the offspring of rats fed an ethanol-containing liquid diet (Et), pair-fed a liquid control diet (Ct), or fed chow and water (Ch). During the first postnatal week, radial glial fibers (in ethanol-containing liquid diet(Et) -treated rats and controls) stretched from the <BrainRegion>ventricular surface</BrainRegion> through the developing <BrainRegion>cerebral wall</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>pial surface</BrainRegion>. In the ethanol-containing liquid diet(Et) -treated rats, the radial processes were less dense and more poorly fasciculated than they were in the chow and water(Ch) - and control diet(Ct) -treated rats. Moreover, by postnatal day (P) 5, there was a significant reduction in RAT-401 immunostaining in the ethanol-containing liquid diet(Et) -treated rats, particularly in the <BrainRegion>superficial cortex</BrainRegion>. A similar reduction in control rats did not begin until P10. In all three treatment groups, glial fibrillary acidic protein(GFAP) -immunoreactive astrocytes were in the <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion> throughout the period from P1 to P45. In neonates, glial fibrillary acidic protein(GFAP) -positive cells were distributed in the marginal zone (layer I) and the intermediate zone (the white matter). The number of glial fibrillary acidic protein(GFAP) -positive cells in the <BrainRegion>cortical plate</BrainRegion> increased steadily with time so that, by P26, glial fibrillary acidic protein(GFAP) -immunoreactive astrocytes were distributed evenly through all <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> laminae. Interestingly, between P5 and P12, the number of astrocytes was significantly greater in ethanol-containing liquid diet(Et) -treated rats than in controls. Thus prenatal exposure to ethanol induces the premature loss of RAT-401-positive processes and the precocious increase in glial fibrillary acidic protein(GFAP) immunostaining. These ethanol-induced changes in glial development indicate that ethanol accelerates the transformation of radial glia into astrocytes. Moreover, the ethanol-induced premature degradation of the network of radial glial fibers may underlie the migration of late-generated neurons to ectopic sites.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>The visual connections of the adult flatfish, Achirus lineatus.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Metamorphosis in the flatfish is characterized by the migration of one eye around the dorsal surface of the head to a position adjacent to the other eye on the new top side of the animal. The visual connections of the adult flatfish, Achirus lineatus, were examined. Either the migrating or non-migrating eye was removed and the animal allowed to survive for one to three weeks. Alternate sections of the brain were stained by a modification of the Fink-Heimer technique, or with cresyl violet. The <BrainRegion>diencephalic</BrainRegion> visual connections of the flatfish were similar to those of other teleosts with contralateral projections to the <BrainRegion>nuclei corticalis</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>dorsomedialis thalami</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>pretectalis</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>corpus geniculatum laterale</BrainRegion>. The distribution of the <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> efferents to the <BrainRegion>optic tectum</BrainRegion> is unique in the flatfish. In the <BrainRegion>medial one-third of the tectum</BrainRegion>, terminal degeneration was found in three bands in the <BrainRegion>stratum opticum</BrainRegion> (SO) and the <BrainRegion>stratum griseum et fibrosum superficiale</BrainRegion> (sgfs). In the <BrainRegion>middle part of the tectum</BrainRegion>, two bands of degeneration remained over the <BrainRegion>stratum griseum et fibrosum superficiale</BrainRegion>(sgfs) . The <BrainRegion>lateral part of the tectum</BrainRegion> has only a very small amount of degeneration distributed radomly in scattered clusters over the deep <BrainRegion>stratum opticum</BrainRegion>(SO) and <BrainRegion>superficial stratum griseum et fibrosum superficiale</BrainRegion>(sgfs) . The Nissl preparations also reflected the differences between the <BrainRegion>medial and lateral parts of the tectum</BrainRegion>. Distinct layer was lacking in the <BrainRegion>medial tectum</BrainRegion> with a conspicuously absent large cell layer in the <BrainRegion>stratum griseum centrale</BrainRegion> (sgc). In contrast, the <BrainRegion>lateral tectum</BrainRegion> had a typical tectal stratification. Most notable were the large neurons of the <BrainRegion>stratum griseum centrale</BrainRegion>(sgc) .</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Postnatal changes in the number of astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia in the <BrainRegion>visual cortex</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>area 17</BrainRegion>) of the macaque monkey: a stereological analysis in normal and monocularly deprived animals.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The numerical densities (Nv) of astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia were measured in individual laminae of the <BrainRegion>striate cortex</BrainRegion> of macaque monkeys ranging in age from newborn to adult. Using measurements o<BrainRegion>f cortical</BrainRegion> thickness and surface area, the total number of cells in the <BrainRegion>striate cortex</BrainRegion> of one hemisphere was derived for each glial cell type. Normal monkeys were compared at 3 months and 6 months of age to animals reared from birth with a monocular eyelid suture. No significant differences were observed between normal and monocularly deprived monkeys. The combined data from these groups, however, demonstrated several significant developmental changes. The Nv of astrocytes decreased from birth to 6 months of age and subsequently increased in the adult. The greatest changes were seen in the more superficial laminae. These changes, however, were only a response to a substantial overshoot in <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> volume at six months: the total number of astrocytes in the <BrainRegion>striate cortex</BrainRegion> did not change. There was a tenfold increase in both the Nv and the total number of oligodendrocytes from birth to maturity with a corresponding increase in the density of myelinated axons. The greatest changes were observed in the deeper laminae. The total number of microglia remained relatively constant from birth to 6 months of age. There was a 55% reduction in the number of microglia in the adult, although statistical analysis indicated that this decrease was only of borderline significance. The possible relationships between these postnatal changes in glial cell numbers and the development of neuronal connectivity are discussed.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Cytoskeletal organization of the developing mouse <BrainRegion>olfactory nerve</BrainRegion> layer.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) axonal extension and targeting occur within the <BrainRegion>olfactory nerve</BrainRegion> layer (ONL) of the <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> (OB). The <BrainRegion>olfactory nerve</BrainRegion> layer(ONL) can be differentiated into sublaminae: the outer ( <BrainRegion>olfactory nerve</BrainRegion> layer(ONL) o), where axons broadly target regions of the <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>(OB) in tight fascicles, and inner ( <BrainRegion>olfactory nerve</BrainRegion> layer(ONL) i), where axons perform final targeting in loosely organized fascicles. During perinatal development, cadherin-2 and its binding partner, gamma-catenin, are preferentially expressed by Olfactory sensory neuron(OSN) axons in the <BrainRegion>olfactory nerve</BrainRegion> layer(ONL) o vs. the <BrainRegion>olfactory nerve</BrainRegion> layer(ONL) i. Given the expression of these cytoskeleton-associated molecules, we hypothesized that cytoskeletal elements of Olfactory sensory neuron(OSN) axons may be differentially expressed across the <BrainRegion>olfactory nerve</BrainRegion> layer(ONL) . We therefore examined cytoskeletal organization of Olfactory sensory neuron(OSN) axons in the <BrainRegion>olfactory nerve</BrainRegion> layer(ONL) , focusing on the day of birth (P0). We show that microfilaments, microtubules, and the intermediate filament (IF) vimentin are homogeneously expressed across the <BrainRegion>olfactory nerve</BrainRegion> layer(ONL) at P0. In contrast, the intermediate filament(IF) s peripherin and alpha-internexin are preferentially localized to the <BrainRegion>olfactory nerve</BrainRegion> layer(ONL) o at P0, with alpha-internexin expressed by a restricted subset of Olfactory sensory neuron(OSN) s. We also show that Olfactory sensory neuron(OSN) axons in the <BrainRegion>olfactory nerve</BrainRegion> layer(ONL) o are significantly smaller than those in the <BrainRegion>olfactory nerve</BrainRegion> layer(ONL) i. The data demonstrate that, as Olfactory sensory neuron(OSN) axons begin to exit the <BrainRegion>olfactory nerve</BrainRegion> layer(ONL) o and target a specific region of the <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>(OB) , there is a down-regulation of cytoskeletal elements and bound extracellular adhesion molecules. The increase in axon diameter may reflect additional mechanisms involved in glomerular targeting or the formation of the large terminal boutons of Olfactory sensory neuron(OSN) axons within glomeruli.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Central course of digital axons within the median nerve of Macaca mulatta.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The traditional view that axons are not functionally grouped within proximal human nerve is based on the interfascicular dissections of Sunderland (&apos;45). However, microstimulation and microneurography (Schady et al., '83a; Hallin, '90) reveal proximal grouping of cutaneous sensory axons from small areas of skin. In the present studies, conjugates of horseradish peroxidase with wheat germ agglutinin (HRP-WGA) were used to trace the course of digital nerve axons within the median nerve of Macaca mulatta. The electrophysiologic findings were confirmed, suggesting the potential for precise surgical realignment of functionally related axons even after proximal nerve transection. Radial digital nerves were labeled in the thumb (bilateral, 1 animal), the index finger (unilateral, 2 animals), and the middle finger (bilateral, 1 animal). Median nerve cross sections were cut at 1-cm intervals, treated with tetramethyl benzidine to demonstrate horseradish peroxidase with wheat germ agglutinin(HRP-WGA) within axons, and compiled to form maps of each digital nerve "territory" within the median nerve. These territories were limited to a single, densely labeled fascicle at the wrist level. They expanded somewhat in the forearm to encompass clusters of labeled axons within a matrix of unlabeled axon profiles. The clusters were more loosely packed in the arm, occupying 1/3 to 1/6 of the nerve cross section at the entrance to the brachial plexus. The three digital nerve territories studied were widely separated at the wrist level. In the proximal arm, there was moderate intermingling of axons from adjacent digits, but those to the middle finger and thumb remained segregated. Territory configuration differed widely overall, but was moderately constant for each digit. The location of territories within the nerve was often strikingly similar from right to left and from animal to animal, with occasional prominent variations reflecting isolated rotation of one nerve.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>The afferent and sympathetic components of the <BrainRegion>lumbar spinal</BrainRegion> outflow to the colon and pelvic organs in the cat. I. The hypogastric nerve.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The cell bodies of the lumbar sensory and sympathetic pre- and postganglionic neurons that project to the pelvic organs in the hypogastric nerve of the cat have been labeled retrogradely with horseradish peroxidase applied to the central end of their cut axons. The numbers, segmental distribution, location, and size of these labeled somata have been determined quantitatively. Afferent and preganglionic cell bodies were located bilaterally in <BrainRegion>dorsal root ganglia</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> segments L3-L5, with the maximum numbers in L4. Very few cells lay rostral to L3. Afferent cell bodies were generally very small in cross-sectional area relative to the entire population in the dorsal root ganglia. Most of the preganglionic cell bodies lay clustered just medial to the region of the <BrainRegion>intermediolateral column</BrainRegion> and extended caudally well beyond its usual limit in the upper part of L4. These neurons were, on the average, larger than the cells of the <BrainRegion>intermediolateral column</BrainRegion> itself, with the largest cells lying in the most medial positions. Most of the post-ganglionic somata were in the ipsilateral distal lobe of the inferior mesenteric ganglion, while some (usually less than 10%) lay in accessory ganglia along the lumbar splanchnic nerves and in paravertebral ganglia L3-L5. Postganglionic somata in the inferior mesenteric ganglion were larger than both labeled and unlabeled ganglion cells in the paravertebral ganglia. From the data, it is estimated that about 1,300 afferent neurons, about 1,700 preganglionic neurons, and about 17,000 postganglionic neurons project in each hypogastric nerve in the cat.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Feline <BrainRegion>islands of Calleja complex</BrainRegion>: I. Cytoarchitectural organization and comparative anatomy.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Cytoarchitectural analyses demonstrated that the <BrainRegion>islands of Calleja complex</BrainRegion> (ICC) is highly developed and discretely organized in the cat. The feline complex is clearly divided into morphological units, each containing a <BrainRegion>granular Callejal island</BrainRegion> and a population of satellite neurons. These <BrainRegion>islands of Calleja complex</BrainRegion>(ICC) units change progressively in cytoarchitecture from the lateral to the <BrainRegion>medial edge of the olfactory tubercle</BrainRegion>. In particular, the islands flatten, sink into the tubercular molecular layer, and increase in cell density, while their satellite neurons increase in number and decrease in size. The lateromedial transformation was judged to take place in five stages, resulting in the successive appearance of <BrainRegion>lateral, lateral transitional, central, medial transitional, and medial islands of Calleja complex</BrainRegion>(ICC) units. The first two unit types display prominently two additional components of the feline <BrainRegion>islands of Calleja complex</BrainRegion>(ICC) -namely, clusters of dwarf cells and small pyramidal-like neurons constituting the densocellular layer cupping the base of <BrainRegion>lateral Callejal islands</BrainRegion>. All of the various types of <BrainRegion>islands of Calleja complex</BrainRegion>(ICC) units contact the tubercular molecular layer via their dwarf and/or granule cell components, raising the possibility of direct <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> input to the entire <BrainRegion>Callejal complex</BrainRegion> (apart from the <BrainRegion>isla magna</BrainRegion>). Output from the complex is presumed to arise from the satellite neurons, which are distinguished from adjoining cell populations by their close association with <BrainRegion>Callejal islands</BrainRegion>, typical chromophilic character, and relatively large size (15-42 micron in soma length). In the <BrainRegion>tubercular islands of Calleja complex</BrainRegion>(ICC) , these neurons are most numerous immediately above <BrainRegion>Callejal islands</BrainRegion> in a fiber-rich zone continuous with the <BrainRegion>supratubercular zone</BrainRegion> and hence with the <BrainRegion>ventral pallidum</BrainRegion>. In the <BrainRegion>accumbal islands of Calleja complex</BrainRegion>(ICC) , satellite neurons are most conspicuous in granule-cell-poor spaces within the <BrainRegion>isla magna</BrainRegion>, where many non-granular neurons are uncharacteristically small and chromophobic. The <BrainRegion>isla magna</BrainRegion> itself is unusual not only for its large size but for lateral extensions encircling a group of <BrainRegion>accumbal</BrainRegion> neurons far caudally. Such extensions are one of several indications that the <BrainRegion>isla magna</BrainRegion> is intimately associated with the <BrainRegion>nucleus accumbens</BrainRegion>. A comparative anatomical survey of the <BrainRegion>islands of Calleja complex</BrainRegion>(ICC) in rats, cats, and macaque monkeys demonstrated a number of species differences. Of particular interest is the finding that the complex is unambiguously divided into discrete island-satellite cell units only in cats and macaques. In these species, the complex is also distinguished by a predominance of superficial islands and an especially prominent <BrainRegion>isla magna</BrainRegion>. <BrainRegion>islands of Calleja complex</BrainRegion>(ICC) units, however, were most conspicuous in cats.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Characterization of atypical cells in the juvenile rat <BrainRegion>organ of corti</BrainRegion> after aminoglycoside ototoxicity.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Hair cell regeneration is well documented in the <BrainRegion>inner ear</BrainRegion> sensory epithelia of lower vertebrates and birds and may occur in the <BrainRegion>vestibular organs</BrainRegion> of mammals. By contrast, hair cell loss in the mature mammalian <BrainRegion>cochlea</BrainRegion> is considered irreversible. However, recent reports have suggested that an attempt at hair cell regeneration could occur in vivo in aminoglycoside-lesioned <BrainRegion>cochleas</BrainRegion> from neonatal rats. After amikacin treatment, atypical cells with apical specialization reminiscent of early differentiating stereocilia are transiently present at the apex of the intoxicated <BrainRegion>cochleas</BrainRegion> but fail to differentiate as hair cells in later stages. In the present study, we used electronic microscopy, histochemistry, and confocal microscopy to investigate the cellular rearrangements in the amikacin-lesioned <BrainRegion>organ of Corti</BrainRegion> of rat pups. In addition, we used 5-bromo-2&apos;-deoxyuridine immunocytochemistry to determine whether mitotic processes are involved in the formation of the atypical cells. The morphologic and molecular data suggest that atypical cells are not recovering hair cells, but share characteristics of immature hair cells and supporting cells. Proliferative cells were absent from the region occupied by atypical cells, suggesting that the latter did not arise through mitotic processes. Altogether, the present results support the hypothesis that atypical cells arise through direct transformation of some of the supporting cells that reorganize during hair cell degeneration.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>The somatotopic organization of primary afferent terminals in the superficial laminae of the <BrainRegion>dorsal horn</BrainRegion> of the rat <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText><BrainRegion>Transganglionic</BrainRegion> transport of wheatgerm agglutinin conjugated horse-radish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) was used to reveal the central distribution of terminals of primary afferent fibers from <BrainRegion>peripheral nerves</BrainRegion> innervating the hind leg of the rat. In separate experiments the sizes and locations of cutaneous peripheral receptive fields were determined by electrophysiological recording techniques for each of the nerves that had been labeled with wheatgerm agglutinin conjugated horse-radish peroxidase(WGA-HRP) . By using digital image analysis, the sizes and positions of the peripheral receptive fields were correlated with the areas of <BrainRegion>superficial dorsal horn</BrainRegion> occupied by terminals of primary afferents from each of these receptive fields. Data were obtained from the posterior cutaneous nerve of the thigh, lateral sural, sural, saphenous, superficial peroneal, and tibial nerves. The subdivisions of the sciatic nerve, the sural, lateral sural, superficial peroneal, and tibial nerves each projected to a separate and distinct region of the <BrainRegion>superficial dorsal horn</BrainRegion> and collectively formed a &quot;U"-shaped zone of terminal labeling extending from <BrainRegion>lumbar spinal segments</BrainRegion> L2 to the caudal portions of L5. The gap in the &quot;U" extended from L2 to the L3-4 boundary and was occupied by terminals from the saphenous nerve. Collectively, all primary afferents supplying the hindlimb occupied the medial 3/4 of the <BrainRegion>superficial dorsal horn</BrainRegion> with terminals from the tibial nerve lying most medially and occupying the largest of all the terminal fields. Afferents from the superficial peroneal lay in a zone between the medially situated tibial zone and the more laterally placed sural zone. Afferents from the posterior cutaneous nerve were located most caudally and laterally. Terminal fields from the posterior cutaneous and saphenous nerves differed from the others in having split representations caused presumably by their proximity to the mid-axial line of the limb. Comparisons between the peripheral and the central representations of each nerve revealed that 1 mm2 of surface area of the <BrainRegion>superficial dorsal horn</BrainRegion> serves approximately 600-900 mm2 of hairy skin and roughly 300 mm2 of glabrous skin. The vast majority of terminal labeling observed in the <BrainRegion>dorsal horn</BrainRegion> was found in the marginal layer and <BrainRegion>substantia gelatinosa</BrainRegion>, suggesting that small diameter afferents have an orderly somatotopic arrangement in which each portion of the skin surface is innervated by afferent fibers that terminate in preferred localities within the <BrainRegion>dorsal horn</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Isolation and characterization of two teleost melanopsin genes and their differential expression within the <BrainRegion>inner retina</BrainRegion> and brain.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Melanopsin is a newly discovered photopigment that is believed to be involved in the regulation of circadian rhythms in tetrapods. Here we describe the characterization of the first two teleost melanopsins (opn4a and opn4b) isolated from Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua). These two teleost genes belong to a subgroup of melanopsins that also include members from Xenopus, chicken, and Takifugu. In situ hybridization revealed that opn4a and opn4b are differentially expressed within the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> and brain. In the larval and adult <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>, both melanopsins are expressed in a subset of cells in the <BrainRegion>inner retina</BrainRegion>, resembling amacrine and ganglion cells. In addition, opn4a is expressed in the horizontal cells, indicating a separate task for this gene. In the brain, the two melanopsins are separately expressed in two major <BrainRegion>retinal and extraretinal photosensitive integration centers</BrainRegion>, namely, the <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion> (opn4a) and the <BrainRegion>habenula</BrainRegion> (opn4b). The expression of opn4a in the <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion> in cod is similar to the melanopsin expression found in Xenopus. This suggests a conserved role for this opsin and an involvement in mediation of nonvisual photoreceptive tasks, such as entraining circadian rhythms and/or hypophysiotrophic systems. The differential expression of opn4b in the <BrainRegion>habenula</BrainRegion> suggests that this gene plays a role similar to that of opn4a, in that it is also situated in an area that integrates photic inputs from the pineal as well as other brain regions. Thus, the <BrainRegion>habenula</BrainRegion> may be an additional region that mediates photic cues in teleosts.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>The projection of the visual field onto the <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion> of the ferret.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The projection of the visual field onto the <BrainRegion>dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion> (LGN) of the ferret was mapped electrophysiologically. The nucleus contains a single orderly map of the contralateral visual hemifield. The upper visual field is represented dorsally and rostrally in the nucleus; central fields are found in the <BrainRegion>medial and caudal sections of the lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(LGN) ; and peripheral fields are represented most laterally. The ipsilateral eye is represented in laminae A1 and C1 up to eccentricities of 20-30 degrees. Lines of projection run perpendicular to the laminar borders. The ferret <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(LGN) resembles that of the cat rotated approximately 110 degrees clockwise in the sagittal plane, viewing the right nucleus from its lateral aspect; it differs from the cat in having a larger monocular segment.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>The structural organization of the inferior and lateral subdivisions of the Macaca monkey <BrainRegion>pulvinar</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Previous light microscopic studies of Macaca <BrainRegion>pulvinar</BrainRegion> have demonstrated that both the <BrainRegion>inferior and adjacent portion of the lateral pulvinar subdivisions</BrainRegion> are reciprocally connected to the entire <BrainRegion>occipital lobe</BrainRegion>, including <BrainRegion>striate cortex</BrainRegion>. They differ in that <BrainRegion>inferior</BrainRegion> but not <BrainRegion>lateral pulvinar</BrainRegion> receives a projection from the superficial layers of the <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion>. In this study, the internal organization of these two subdivisions in compared by relating light microscopic Golgi morphology to the synaptic organization observed by electron microscopy. The Golgi impregnated neurons in <BrainRegion>inferior and lateral pulvinar</BrainRegion> are typical of other <BrainRegion>thalamic nuclei</BrainRegion> and are not qualitatively different in the two subdivisions. Projections neurons (PN) vary in cell body (15--40 micrometers) and dendritic tree (150--600 micrometers) diameters but bear the same varieties of dendritic appendages; spine-like, hair-like, and knot-like. Local circuit neurons (LCN) have smaller cell body diameters (10--20 micrometers) but can have very large dendritic field diameters (150--600 micrometers). They are best distinguished from Projections neurons(PN) s by their elaborate dendritic appendages, which have been identified as pre-synaptic dendrites in the EM. Local circuit neurons(LCN) axons are infrequently seen. In the EM both subdivisions contain four types of synaptic terminals. RS and RL terminal both contain round symaptic vesicles and make asymmetric synaptic contacts, but are subdivided on the basis of small (RS = 0.09 micrometers) versus large (RL = 2.2 micrometers) cross sectional diameters and organelle content. RLs contact larger caliber dendrites and frequently form synaptic complexes with presynaptic dendrites of Local circuit neurons(LCN) s, while RSs contact fine caliber dendrites and rarely take part in synaptic complexes. F terminal and P boutons both contain flat and pleomorphis vesicles and make symmetric synaptic contacts. They are characterized by vesicle number and cytoplasmic density. Fs are infrequently observed in <BrainRegion>pulvinar</BrainRegion> compared to P boutons and are of uncertain origin. P boutons can be equated with Local circuit neurons(LCN) dendritic appendages and have been identified as pre-synaptic dendrites. The quantitative distribution of each type is very similar in both subdivisions, avveraging RS 85%, RL 5%, F 0.3%, P 8% and unidentified 2%.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Site-specific estrogen and progestin regulation of orphanin FQ/nociceptin and nociceptin opioid receptor mRNA expression in the female rat limbic hypothalamic system.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The distributions of orphanin FQ (OFQ/N; also known as nociceptin) and its cognate receptor, opioid receptor-like receptor-1 (NOP), overlap steroid-responsive regions throughout reproductive circuits of the <BrainRegion>limbic system</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion>. For example, in the <BrainRegion>ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus</BrainRegion> (VMH), OFQ/N facilitates lordosis in female rats through estrogen and progesterone regulation of nociceptin activity. We studied estrogen and progesterone regulation of OFQ/N and NOP mRNA expression in <BrainRegion>limbic</BrainRegion>-<BrainRegion>hypothalamic</BrainRegion> reproductive circuits. Ovariectomized rats were treated with 17beta-estradiol-benzoate (2 microg) and 26 hours later with oil or progesterone (500 microg) and were killed 30 hours after initial treatment. Alternate brain sections were processed for OFQ/N or NOP mRNA in situ hybridization. High levels of hybridization for NOP and OFQ/N and overlapping distributions were observed throughout the <BrainRegion>limbic</BrainRegion> <BrainRegion>hypothalamic</BrainRegion> reproductive circuits; however, in <BrainRegion>ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus</BrainRegion>(VMH) , only NOP expression was observed. Estrogen treatment increased NOP mRNA expression in <BrainRegion>anteroventral periventricular nucleus</BrainRegion> (AVPV), <BrainRegion>median preoptic nucleus</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus</BrainRegion>(VMH) . Subsequent progesterone treatment did not alter estrogen-induced expression of NOP mRNA in <BrainRegion>ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus</BrainRegion>(VMH) or <BrainRegion>median preoptic nucleus</BrainRegion> but reduced expression in the <BrainRegion>anteroventral periventricular nucleus</BrainRegion>(AVPV) . OFQ/N mRNA levels were also regulated by steroids. In the <BrainRegion>caudal part of the posterodorsal medial amygdala</BrainRegion>, estrogen increased OFQ/N mRNA levels, and progesterone did not alter this increase, whereas, in the <BrainRegion>medial part of the medial preoptic nucleus</BrainRegion>, estrogen and progesterone were needed to increase OFQ/N mRNA levels. Steroid regulation of OFQ/N and NOP in the <BrainRegion>medial preoptic nucleus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus</BrainRegion>(VMH) is consistent with emerging data indicating that this opioid system regulates female reproduction.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Catecholamine innervation of the <BrainRegion>caudal spinal cord</BrainRegion> in the rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>By means of the aluminum-formaldehyde (ALFA) fluorescence technique for monoamine visualization the distribution of catecholamines was studied in the <BrainRegion>caudal spinal cord</BrainRegion>, particularly in relation to motoneurons innervating pelvic structures. In the <BrainRegion>lumbosacral cord</BrainRegion> all parts of the <BrainRegion>spinal gray matter</BrainRegion> were found to contain catecholamines. In the <BrainRegion>dorsal horn</BrainRegion> the most intense fluorescence was seen in the superficial layers. The motoneuron neuropil exhibited the most prominent catecholamine-fluorescence of the <BrainRegion>ventral horn</BrainRegion> layers. In the sixth lumbar segment, which contains the <BrainRegion>motor nuclei</BrainRegion> that innervate the pelvic striated muscles as well as one innervating muscles in the lower limb, a differential distribution of the density of catecholamine fluorescence was presented by the individual nuclei. The catecholamine fibers in the motoneuron neuropil were seen closely surrounding the motoneuron somata, suggesting the existence of axosomatic contacts, and by utilizing the fluorescent retrograde tracer True Blue in combination with the aluminum-formaldehyde(ALFA) method tentative axosomatic noradrenergic synapses on identified neurons innervating small striated pelvic muscles could be visualized in the light microscope. In the <BrainRegion>intermediate gray the intermediolateral nucleus in thoracic and upper lumbar segments</BrainRegion> was the most heavily innervated area, followed by the <BrainRegion>medial lumbar sympathetic group</BrainRegion>, which contains the majority of the sympathetic preganglionic neurons innervating the pelvic organs. The <BrainRegion>parasympathetic intermediolateral nucleus</BrainRegion> in the upper sacral segments received a catecholamine innervation of moderate density. The catecholamine innervation pattern is discussed in relation to the patterns of other putative transmitters. The distribution of catecholamine fluorescence in relation to nuclei that control the pelvic organs differs from the arrangement of other transmitters in this region. The complexity of the innervation of the pelvic organs and their related striated muscles is thus further stressed.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Neurochemical differentiation of functionally distinct populations of autonomic neurons.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The coeliac ganglion of guinea pigs displays a unique topographical arrangement of neurochemically and functionally distinct populations of sympathetic neurons. The authors used multiple-labeling immunohistochemistry to investigate the neurochemical differentiation of these neurons during embryonic and fetal development. Sympathoadrenal precursors, located on either side of the abdominal aorta, were intensely immunoreactive for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH-IR), neurofilament, and the human natural killer 1 antibody at midembryonic stages (Carnegie stages 16-19). During late embryonic stages (stages 20-23), a single bilobed ganglion had formed. At this time, neuropeptide Y immunoreactivity (NPY-IR) was widely expressed in sympathetic neurons (with moderate TH-IR) and chromaffin cells (with intense TH-IR). The onset of somatostatin (Som-IR) expression followed that of neuropeptide Y immunoreactivity(NPY-IR) and was restricted to sympathetic neurons. However, at late embryonic stages, most TH-IR neurons with Som-IR also expressed neuropeptide Y immunoreactivity(NPY-IR) (a combination of peptides not found in the mature coeliac ganglion). Between late embryonic stages and the end of the early fetal period, there was a significant increase in the proportion of neurons in lateral regions that had both neuropeptide Y immunoreactivity(NPY-IR) and TH-IR. At the same time, there was an increase in the proportion of neurons in medial regions that had both Som-IR and TH-IR. Neurons expressing both Som-IR and TH-IR were rarely observed in lateral regions of the coeliac ganglion. Thus, a clear topography within the coeliac ganglion is established during late embryonic and early fetal stages of development and reflects that found in the mature animal by the end of the early fetal period.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Long-term consequences of impaired regeneration on facial motoneurons in the C57BL/Ola mouse.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Peripheral nerves of the C57BL/Ola mouse mutant undergo markedly slowed Wallerian degeneration following injury. This is associated with impaired regeneration of both sensory and motor axons. Following a crush lesion of the <BrainRegion>facial nerve</BrainRegion>, there was no cell loss in <BrainRegion>facial nuclei</BrainRegion> of normal (C57BL/6J) adult mice, but 40% cell loss occurred in Ola mice and the survivors increased in size during the period when functional reinnervation was established. These results are interpreted as a result, first, of prolonged deprivation of target-derived trophic factor in the slowly regenerating Ola motoneurons and second, increased peripheral field size of the survivors. Within the regenerated facial nerve, there was marked heterogeneity of myelinated fibre size in Ola mice. Some Ola axons, both proximal and distal to the lesion site, had areas over twice as great as the largest 6J axons when measured 1 year following injury. A population of small diameter fibres, not observed in 6J nerves, persisted distal to the crush site in Ola nerves, and this was associated with an increase in the total number of myelinated axons in the distal nerve: on average, each parent Ola axon retained three persistent daughter axons. The delayed Wallerian degeneration in Ola mice not only impairs immediate axon regrowth, but also results in a breakdown of the normal mechanisms which regulate axon number and size in regenerating nerve.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Development of <BrainRegion>callosal</BrainRegion> topography in <BrainRegion>visual cortex</BrainRegion> of normal and enucleated rats.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>In normal rats <BrainRegion>callosal</BrainRegion> projections in <BrainRegion>striate cortex</BrainRegion> connect retinotopically corresponding, nonmirror-symmetric <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> loci, whereas in rats bilaterally enucleated at birth, <BrainRegion>callosal</BrainRegion> fibers connect topographically mismatched, mirror-symmetric loci. Moreover, <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> input specifies the topography of <BrainRegion>callosal</BrainRegion> projections by postnatal day (P)6. To investigate whether <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> input guides development of <BrainRegion>callosal</BrainRegion> maps by promoting either the corrective pruning of exuberant axon branches or the specific ingrowth and elaboration of axon branches at topographically correct places, we studied the topography of emerging <BrainRegion>callosal</BrainRegion> connections at and immediately after P6. After restricted intracortical injections of anterogradely and retrogradely transported tracers we observed that the normal, nonmirror-symmetric <BrainRegion>callosal</BrainRegion> map, as well as the anomalous, mirror-symmetric map observed in neonatally enucleated animals, are present by P6-7, just as collateral branches of simple architecture emerge from their parental axons and grow into superficial <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> layers. Our results therefore do not support the idea that <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> input guides <BrainRegion>callosal</BrainRegion> map formation by primarily promoting the large-scale elimination of long, nontopographic branches and arbors. Instead, they suggest that <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> input specifies the sites on the parental axons from which interstitial branches will grow to invade middle and upper <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> layers, thereby ensuring that the location of invading interstitial branches is accurately related to the topographical location of the soma that gives rise to the parental axon. Moreover, our results from enucleated rats suggest that the cues that determine the mirror-symmetric <BrainRegion>callosal</BrainRegion> map exert only a weak control on the topography of fiber ingrowth.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Postnatal development of type I <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> ganglion cells in hamsters: a lucifer yellow study.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The postnatal development of a population of <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion> projecting <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> ganglion cells with large somata in hamsters aged from postnatal day (P) 4 to adult was studied by the intracellular injection of Lucifer Yellow. This population of cells was interpreted as Type I cells based on their large soma sizes and dendritic morphology resembling that of mature Type I cells. In addition to the growth of the soma and the dendritic field, transient morphological features such as intraretinal axon collaterals and exuberant dendritic spines, but not somatic spines, were frequently observed on this population of cells in hamsters during development. None of them exhibited any intraretinal axon collaterals after P7. The number of transient spine-like processes on dendrites increased from P4 onwards to reach a peak at P16, decreased abruptly within a few days after the peak, and stabilised to reach the adult level by P30. These developing cells attained the maximum number of dendritic branches by P16 and there seems to be little, if any, reduction in the number of branch points after this time point. In addition, the length of individual branches of dendrites was not increased excessively during development and then shortened during maturation. Thus, the dendritic remodeling of these cells after P16 seems to be mainly the increase of the length of dendrites and the removal of exuberant dendritic spines.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>The <BrainRegion>pretectal nucleus lentiformis mesencephali</BrainRegion> of Rana pipiens.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The <BrainRegion>pretectal nucleus lentiformis mesencephali</BrainRegion> (nLM) of Rana pipiens was investigated with autoradiographic, horseradish peroxidase (HRP), and Golgi techniques. <BrainRegion>Retinal</BrainRegion> afferents to <BrainRegion>nucleus lentiformis mesencephali</BrainRegion>(nLM) originate primarily from the <BrainRegion>central retina</BrainRegion>. The primary projection is contralateral with a small ipsilateral component. Following <BrainRegion>optic nerve</BrainRegion> transection and horseradish peroxidase(HRP) impregnation, <BrainRegion>contralateral retinal</BrainRegion> afferents show a restricted, dense core of horseradish peroxidase(HRP) label in the superficial portion of the nucleus with sparser horseradish peroxidase(HRP) label in the surround. <BrainRegion>Ipsilateral retinal</BrainRegion> afferents arborize throughout <BrainRegion>nucleus lentiformis mesencephali</BrainRegion>(nLM) , except in the dense-core region. Additional afferents to <BrainRegion>nucleus lentiformis mesencephali</BrainRegion>(nLM) originate from the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral tectum</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>nucleus rotundus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>mesencephalic pretectal gray</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>contralateral nucleus lentiformis mesencephali</BrainRegion>(nLM) , and the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the basal optic root</BrainRegion>. Afferents from the accessory optic system arborize only in the dense-core region, following horseradish peroxidase(HRP) injections into the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the basal optic root</BrainRegion>, while afferents from the <BrainRegion>mesencephalic pretectal gray</BrainRegion> arborize in all parts of <BrainRegion>nucleus lentiformis mesencephali</BrainRegion>(nLM) except the dense core. Afferents from the <BrainRegion>tectum</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>anterior thalamus</BrainRegion> appear to arborize throughout the nucleus without discernible pattern. The lamination of afferent terminals in <BrainRegion>nucleus lentiformis mesencephali</BrainRegion>(nLM) was correlated with Nissl-stained cytoarchitectural material in which the majority of large neurons cluster around the dense core of <BrainRegion>nucleus lentiformis mesencephali</BrainRegion>(nLM) . Three types of neurons occur in <BrainRegion>nucleus lentiformis mesencephali</BrainRegion>(nLM) : large neurons (25-micron dia.), fusiform neurons (12.5-micron dia.), and stellate neurons (10-micron dia.). Additionally, two cell groups outside <BrainRegion>nucleus lentiformis mesencephali</BrainRegion>(nLM) which send dendrites into the nucleus were observed: cells of the <BrainRegion>posterior lateral nucleus</BrainRegion> and cells of the <BrainRegion>posterior thalamic pretectal gray</BrainRegion>. Both large and <BrainRegion>fusiform</BrainRegion> neurons project to the deep layers of the <BrainRegion>optic tectum</BrainRegion> as well as to the <BrainRegion>ventral rhombencephalon</BrainRegion> superficial to the <BrainRegion>abducens nucleus</BrainRegion>. While a small number of <BrainRegion>fusiform</BrainRegion> neurons project to the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the basal optic root</BrainRegion>, the stellate neurons appear to be intrinsic to <BrainRegion>nucleus lentiformis mesencephali</BrainRegion>(nLM) . The anuran <BrainRegion>nucleus lentiformis mesencephali</BrainRegion>(nLM) strongly resembles the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the optic tract</BrainRegion> in mammals in terms of the site of origin of its <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> afferents, lamination of afferent terminations, its central connections, and its demonstrated involvement in horizontal optokinetic nystagmus.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Morphology of central terminations of intra-axonally stained, large, myelinated primary afferent fibers from facial skin in the rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Horseradish peroxidase was intra-axonally injected into functionally identified primary afferent fibers within the rat spinal trigeminal tract in order to study the morphology of their central terminations. They were physiologically determined to be large, myelinated, cutaneous primary afferents by means of electrical and mechanical stimulation of their receptive fields. Ninety-three axons that innervated vibrissa follicles, guard hair follicles, and slowly adapting receptors were stained for distances of 4-12 mm at the levels of the <BrainRegion>main sensory nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>spinal trigeminal nucleus</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>rostral cervical spinal cord</BrainRegion>. The collaterals of single axons from these receptors formed terminal arbors in the outer part of the <BrainRegion>spinal trigeminal nucleus</BrainRegion> rostral to and near the level of the obex (rostral type collaterals). In the rostral part of the <BrainRegion>subnucleus caudalis</BrainRegion> (Vc) they were confined to lamina V (caudalis type collaterals) and in the <BrainRegion>caudal part of Vc</BrainRegion> and in cervical segments they were confined to lamina III/IV (spinal-dorsal-horn-type collaterals). There were no transitional forms between the rostral and caudalis types, but there was a transitional form between the caudalis and <BrainRegion>spinal dorsal horn</BrainRegion> types. This transitional form was distributed in laminae III/IV and V. The terminal arbors of the rostral type of collaterals formed an interrupted, rostrocaudally oriented column like those seen in the <BrainRegion>lumbar dorsal horn</BrainRegion>, but the column shifted down to lamina V near the obex, and more caudally, gradually shifted upward to lamina III. Major morphological differences were not observed among the three different functional types of collaterals with respect to the rostrocaudal distribution of collaterals, and the shape and location of collaterals. The differential laminar distribution of collateral arbors of single axons along the rostrocaudal axis distinguishes the <BrainRegion>spinal trigeminal nucleus</BrainRegion> from the <BrainRegion>spinal dorsal horn</BrainRegion> where functional types of mechanoreceptive afferents form continuous or interrupted sagittal columns of terminal arbors that do not shift dorsoventrally within segments.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>GRIP1 in GABAergic synapses.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The glutamate receptor-interacting protein GRIP1 is present in glutamatergic synapses and interacts with the GluR2/3/4c subunits of the AMPA receptors. This interaction plays important roles in trafficking, synaptic targeting, and recycling of AMPA receptors as well as in the plasticity of glutamatergic synapses. Although GRIP1 has been shown to be present at GABAergic synapses in cultured neurons, the use of EM (electron microscopy) immunocytochemistry in the intact brain has failed to convincingly reveal the presence of GRIP1 in GABAergic synapses. Therefore, most studies on GRIP1 have focused on glutamatergic synapses. By using mild tissue fixation and embedding in electron microscopy(EM) , we show that in the intact brain the 7-PDZ domain GRIP1a/b is present not only in glutamatergic synapses but also in GABAergic synapses. In GABAergic synapses GRIP1a/b localizes both at the presynaptic terminals and postsynaptically, being frequently localized on the synaptic membranes or the synaptic junctional complex. Considerably higher density of GRIP1a/b is found in the presynaptic GABAergic terminals than in the glutamatergic terminals, while the density of GRIP1a/b in the postsynaptic complex is similar in both types of synapses. The results also show that the 7-PDZ and the shorter 4-PDZ domain splice forms of GRIP1 (GRIP1c 4-7) frequently colocalize with each other in individual GABAergic and glutamatergic synapses. The results suggest that GRIP1 splice forms might play important roles in brain GABAergic synapses.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Projections from the <BrainRegion>cochlear nucleus</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>superior paraolivary nucleus</BrainRegion> in guinea pigs.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Axonal tracing techniques were used to study the projection from the <BrainRegion>cochlear nucleus</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>superior paraolivary nucleus</BrainRegion> in guinea pigs. Different tracers were used to identify the cell types that give rise to the projections, the morphology of their axons, and the cell types that they contact in the <BrainRegion>superior paraolivary nucleus</BrainRegion>. Injections of Fluoro-Gold or peroxidase-labeled-WGA and HRP into the <BrainRegion>superior paraolivary nucleus</BrainRegion> labeled multipolar cells and octopus cells bilaterally in the <BrainRegion>ventral cochlear nucleus</BrainRegion>, mainly on the contralateral side. Injections of PHAL into the <BrainRegion>ventral cochlear nucleus</BrainRegion> labeled two types of axons in the <BrainRegion>superior paraolivary nucleus</BrainRegion>. Thin axons branch infrequently and give rise primarily to small, en passant boutons. Thick axons have larger boutons, many of which are terminal boutons that arise from short collaterals. Thin axons appear to originate from multipolar cells, whereas thick axons probably originate from octopus cells. Both types are found bilaterally after an injection into the <BrainRegion>ventral cochlear nucleus</BrainRegion> on one side. Individual thick or thin axons may contact multiple cell types in the <BrainRegion>superior paraolivary nucleus</BrainRegion>. Individual cells in the <BrainRegion>superior paraolivary nucleus</BrainRegion> can receive convergent input from both thick and thin axons. Combined anterograde and retrograde transport of different fluorescent tracers was used to identify the projections of the cells in the <BrainRegion>superior paraolivary nucleus</BrainRegion> that receive inputs from the <BrainRegion>ventral cochlear nucleus</BrainRegion>. Cells in the <BrainRegion>superior paraolivary nucleus</BrainRegion> that projected to the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral cochlear nucleus</BrainRegion> or to the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral inferior colliculus</BrainRegion> appeared to be contacted by axons that were labeled by anterograde transport from the <BrainRegion>contralateral ventral cochlear nucleus</BrainRegion>. Thus the projections to the <BrainRegion>superior paraolivary nucleus</BrainRegion> are in a position to affect the activity in both ascending and descending auditory pathways.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Stereotyped axonal bundle formation and neuromeric patterns in embryos of a cyclostome, Lampetra japonica.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Early embryonic development of the nervous system of a lamprey, Lampetra japonica, was studied by using immunohistochemical techniques and by scanning electron microscopy. The earliest appearance of axons was detected at Tahara&apos;s stage 21-, when <BrainRegion>dorsolateral and ventral longitudinal fasciculi</BrainRegion> were present in the <BrainRegion>hindbrain</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>spinal cord regions</BrainRegion>. The branchiomeric nerve roots began to appear at stage 22; the fibers were joined to the dorsolateral fasciculus proximally and also extended distally into each pharyngeal arch. The <BrainRegion>anterior neural tube</BrainRegion> was divided into several neuromeres: the <BrainRegion>mid-hindbrain sulcus</BrainRegion> became apparent first, then the portion rostral to this sulcus was subdivided into two portions by the syn-parencephalic boundary. In the <BrainRegion>hindbrain</BrainRegion> around stage 23, rhombomeres developed transiently, of which, rhombomere 4 was the most distinctive. Putative crest cells forming the octavofacial nerve root anlage were selectively adhering to rhombomere 4, whereas no crest cells were found on rhombomere 3. The assignment of the crest-derived nerve anlage to rhombomeres is conserved between gnathostomes and L. japonica. The neuromerical scheme of the <BrainRegion>neural tube</BrainRegion> of L. japonica is also mostly in accordance with that in gnathostomes, sharing the basic developmental patterning of axon bundles at early developmental stages. The most distinct difference between these two groups is the topographical relationships between the <BrainRegion>hindbrain</BrainRegion> neuraxis and pharyngeal arches, as well as the otic placode.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Regional and laminar specificity of kainate-stimulated cobalt uptake in the rat <BrainRegion>hippocampal formation</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Kainate and alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptors were initially found to be impermeable to calcium, but cloning and expression studies subsequently revealed that certain kainate and AMPA receptor subunit combinations display substantial divalent cation permeability. The regional and cellular distribution of calcium-permeable kainate/AMPA receptors has not been extensively investigated, however. In this study, we used a histochemical technique, the kainate-stimulated cobalt uptake assay, to localize calcium-permeable kainate responsive receptors in the rat <BrainRegion>hippocampal formation</BrainRegion>. In the presence of cobalt, kainate produced a highly localized, dark granular precipitate in dendrites, perikarya, or both, of <BrainRegion>hippocampal</BrainRegion> neurons. Kainate-stimulated cobalt uptake was time- and concentration-dependent (1 microM-1 mM) and was blocked by the glutamate receptor antagonist, kynurenate. The specific cellular location of cobalt labeling varied regionally within the <BrainRegion>hippocampal formation</BrainRegion>, switching from selective labeling of only apical dendrites in <BrainRegion>Ammon&apos;s horn subregion la</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>CA1a</BrainRegion>) to a diffuse band of punctate labeling in <BrainRegion>CA1c</BrainRegion> to labeling of cell bodies along with their proximal dendrites in <BrainRegion>CA3</BrainRegion>. Furthermore, increasing the kainate concentration not only enhanced the intensity of cobalt labeling, but also changed the pattern of cellular staining from exclusively dendritic labeling to extensive staining of both cell bodies and dendrites in <BrainRegion>CA1a</BrainRegion> pyramidal neurons. High kainate concentrations or prolonged incubation times produced a diffuse cellular labeling suggestive of neurotoxicity. These data are consistent with evidence that specific kainate and AMPA receptor subunit combinations are targeted to specific synapses in <BrainRegion>hippocampal</BrainRegion> pyramidal neurons.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Region-specific activation of microglial cells in the rat <BrainRegion>septal complex</BrainRegion> following <BrainRegion>fimbria-fornix</BrainRegion> transection.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Studies of postlesional microglial activation may gain insight into microglia/neuronal interactions in processes of neurodegeneration. We compared the microglial response after axotomy of septohippocampal projection neurons with that seen after selective immunolesioning of cholinergic septohippocampal neurons with the immunotoxin 192 IgG-saporin. Using the microglial marker isolectin B4 from Griffonia simplicifolia (GSA I-B4), we found striking differences in the microglial response between these two lesion paradigms. Following axotomy of septohippocampal neurons by fimbria-fornix transection (ff-t), there was only a moderate and short-lasting microglial reaction in the <BrainRegion>medial septum</BrainRegion> (MS) in the early postlesion period. Prelabeling of septohippocampal neurons with Fluoro-Gold (FG) prior to axotomy revealed the survival of most neurons, and only very rarely were microglial cells observed that had phagocytosed Fluoro-Gold(FG) -labeled debris. In the <BrainRegion>lateral septum</BrainRegion> (LS) containing the degenerating terminals of <BrainRegion>hippocamposeptal</BrainRegion> fibers transected by fimbria-fornix transection(ff-t) , a heavy reaction of lectin-labeled activated microglial cells associated with high phagocytotic activity was noticed. Unexpectedly, after a long survival time (6 months) following <BrainRegion>fimbria-fornix</BrainRegion> transection(ff-t) , we observed an increase in microglial GSA I-B4 labeling in the <BrainRegion>medial septum</BrainRegion>(MS) . In contrast, an inverse pattern of the microglial response, i.e., a strong initial reaction in the <BrainRegion>medial septum</BrainRegion>(MS) and very little microglial activation in the <BrainRegion>lateral septum</BrainRegion>(LS) , was observed after immunolesioning. Our results indicate that the microglial reaction in the <BrainRegion>medial septum</BrainRegion>(MS) following <BrainRegion>fimbria-fornix</BrainRegion> transection(ff-t) differs substantially from that seen in other models of axotomy.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Morphological correlates of functional recovery in the chicken <BrainRegion>inner ear</BrainRegion> after gentamycin treatment.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Newly hatched chickens were allowed to survive 6, 10, 15, and 20 weeks after 10 days of gentamycin sulfate treatment. Ultrastructural studies of hair cells and nerve terminals in the <BrainRegion>auditory receptor organ</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>basilar papilla</BrainRegion>, were carried out with transmission and scanning electron microscopes. Attention was paid to absolute sensory cell (hair cell) numbers, stereocilia maturity and orientation, and reinnervation within a band 100 micron wide centered 1,100 microns from the basal end of the avian <BrainRegion>cochlea</BrainRegion>. Sensory cell numbers were equivalent to those of untreated control animals within the study area in the earliest survival group. Both immature and mature appearing hair cells were identified throughout the recovery period. However, the ratio of mature to immature hair cells gradually increased to exceed 95% at 20 weeks. Stereocilia bundle reorientation also occurred throughout the study period. Orientation was often abnormal at 6 weeks, but by 20 weeks more than 95% of the regenerated hair cells were aligned within normal limits established in the control ears. Hair cell differentiation occurring at 10-15 weeks was associated with degeneration of the afferent nerve receptor complexes commonly observed in 6 week survivors. These complexes were replaced by one or two small bouton shaped efferent terminals per cell. At 20 weeks, two or three chalice shaped vesiculated terminals were observed per cell in both the gentamycin treated and control ears. On the basis of these observations normal physiological activity would be predicted at 20 weeks following gentamycin treatment, at which time sensory cell repopulation, maturation, reorientation, and innervation approximates the normal anatomical condition.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Cortical</BrainRegion> projections of the <BrainRegion>dorsolateral visual area</BrainRegion> in owl monkeys: the prestriate relay to <BrainRegion>inferior temporal cortex</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The <BrainRegion>dorsolateral visual area</BrainRegion> (DL) is one of a number of visual areas that have been defined by electrophysiological mapping procedures and <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> architecture in the <BrainRegion>extrastriate cortex</BrainRegion> of owl monkeys. The projections of <BrainRegion>dorsolateral visual area</BrainRegion>(DL) were determined by the intra-axonal transport of 3H-proline, 3H-acetyl-wheat germ agglutinin, and horseradish peroxidase after <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> injections. The major ipsilateral projection of <BrainRegion>dorsolateral visual area</BrainRegion>(DL) defined a new subdivision of the <BrainRegion>visual cortex</BrainRegion> in owl monkeys, the <BrainRegion>caudal inferior temporal cortex</BrainRegion>. Single injections in <BrainRegion>dorsolateral visual area</BrainRegion>(DL) sometimes produced label in two separate regions in the <BrainRegion>caudal inferior temporal cortex</BrainRegion>, suggesting that functional subdivisions exist in this projection zone. Other targets of <BrainRegion>dorsolateral visual area</BrainRegion>(DL) included the region of the <BrainRegion>frontal eye fields</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>dorsomedial visual area</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>dorsointermediate visual area</BrainRegion> (DI), a region of the <BrainRegion>cortex rostral to dorsointermediate visual area</BrainRegion>(DI) which we call the <BrainRegion>temporoparietal cortex</BrainRegion>, and possibly the <BrainRegion>ventral (V) and posterior parietal areas</BrainRegion>. A major feedback projection of <BrainRegion>dorsolateral visual area</BrainRegion>(DL) was to <BrainRegion>V-II</BrainRegion>. Projections from <BrainRegion>dorsolateral visual area</BrainRegion>(DL) to <BrainRegion>V-II</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>dorsomedial visual area</BrainRegion> were roughly retinotopic. Projections from <BrainRegion>dorsolateral visual area</BrainRegion>(DL) to the <BrainRegion>contralateral cerebral hemisphere</BrainRegion> were to <BrainRegion>dorsolateral visual area</BrainRegion>(DL) and the <BrainRegion>inferior temporal cortex</BrainRegion>. Overall, the results support the concept that a major relay of visual information proceeds from <BrainRegion>V-I</BrainRegion> to <BrainRegion>V-II</BrainRegion> to <BrainRegion>dorsolateral visual area</BrainRegion>(DL) and then to the <BrainRegion>inferior temporal cortex</BrainRegion>. In addition, similarities in connection patterns of <BrainRegion>dorsolateral visual area</BrainRegion>(DL) in owl monkeys and <BrainRegion>V4</BrainRegion> in macaque monkeys suggest that <BrainRegion>dorsolateral visual area</BrainRegion>(DL) and much or all of <BrainRegion>V4</BrainRegion> are homologous.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Axonal trajectory and terminal distribution of inspiratory neurons of the <BrainRegion>dorsal respiratory group</BrainRegion> in the cat&apos;s <BrainRegion>medulla</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>In Nembutal-anesthetized and artificially ventilated cats, we studied the morphological properties of the inspiratory neurons of the <BrainRegion>dorsal respiratory group</BrainRegion> (DRG) with HRP intracellular staining. A total of 37 neurons were stained and their axonal trajectories and terminal distribution in the <BrainRegion>medulla</BrainRegion> were analyzed. The somata were located predominantly in the <BrainRegion>ventrolateral region of the nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion> and were distributed between 2,300 mum rostral and 700 mum caudal to the obex. Most (26/33) of the neurons tested were antidromically activated by the stimulation of the contralateral (n = 24) or ipsilateral (n = 2) cervical cord. To examine the existence of collateral branches in the <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion>, we traced axonal trajectories in 28 neurons. In most cases, the stem axons issuing from the cells of origin coursed ventrally and then turned medially to cross the midline without giving off any axon collaterals. However, six neurons had axonal collaterals in the <BrainRegion>brain stem</BrainRegion> ipsilateral to the somata. At least four types of collateralization were observed. The stem axon of the first type bifurcated at the area ipsilateral and ventral to the cell body. One branch crossed the midline to project to the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>, and the other, thinner branch descended caudally in the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral medullary reticular formation</BrainRegion> without distributing any terminals. The axon of the second type projected to the <BrainRegion>contralateral spinal cord</BrainRegion> and distributed collateral branches with terminal boutons in the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral ventral respiratory group</BrainRegion> (VRG). The third type projected to the <BrainRegion>contralateral spinal cord</BrainRegion> and distributed terminal boutons in the <BrainRegion>medial part of the nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion> (NTS) and its vicinity. The fourth type distributed numerous branches with terminal boutons in and around the <BrainRegion>ventral part of the nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion>(NTS) and the <BrainRegion>ventral respiratory group</BrainRegion>(VRG) area. This study indicates that some inspiratory neurons of the <BrainRegion>dorsal respiratory group</BrainRegion>(DRG) influence not only <BrainRegion>spinal</BrainRegion> respiratory neurons but also <BrainRegion>medullary</BrainRegion> respiratory neurons in the vicinity of the <BrainRegion>dorsal respiratory group</BrainRegion>(DRG) and the <BrainRegion>ventral respiratory group</BrainRegion>(VRG) .</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Localization of NADPH diaphorase activity in monoaminergic neurons of the rat brain.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Nitric oxide has recently been implicated as a neurotransmitter, and may modulate synaptic transmission, cerebral blood flow, and neurotoxicity. NADPH diaphorase histochemistry has been shown to be a reliable marker for nitric oxide synthase, the enzyme that synthesizes nitric oxide, in the nervous system. Because monoaminergic neurons frequently contain co-transmitters, we examined whether these cells also exhibit NADPH diaphorase activity. Frozen sections from postnatal and adult rat brains were stained for NADPH diaphorase activity and either serotonin-like immunoreactivity or tyrosine hydroxylase-like immunoreactivity. Numerous neurons in the mesopontine serotoninergic cell groups (including the <BrainRegion>caudal linear, dorsal, median, supralemniscal, and pontine raphe nuclei</BrainRegion>) contained both serotonin-like immunoreactivity and NADPH diaphorase activity. Within the <BrainRegion>dorsal raphe nucleus</BrainRegion>, approximately 70% of the serotoninergic neurons in the <BrainRegion>medial subnuclei</BrainRegion> displayed NADPH diaphorase activity, while less than 10% of the serotoninergic neurons in the <BrainRegion>lateral subnuclei</BrainRegion> were doubly labeled. Retrograde labeling with fluorescent microspheres indicated that many raphe-cortical neurons contained NADPH diaphorase activity. No NADPH diaphorase activity was detected in serotoninergic neurons in the <BrainRegion>medullary nuclei</BrainRegion> (including the <BrainRegion>raphe magnus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>raphe pallidum</BrainRegion>, and raphe obscurus). Only a small proportion of tyrosine hydroxylase-like immunoreactive neurons in the <BrainRegion>periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion>, rostral linear nucleus, and <BrainRegion>rostrodorsal ventral tegmental area</BrainRegion> contained NADPH diaphorase activity. Tyrosine hydroxylase-like immunoreactive neurons in the <BrainRegion>substantia nigra</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>locus coeruleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion>, olfactory bulb, and <BrainRegion>dorsal raphe nucleus</BrainRegion> did not contain detectable NADPH diaphorase activity. The observation that many mesopontine (but not <BrainRegion>medullary</BrainRegion>) serotoninergic neurons contain NADPH diaphorase activity suggests that these neurons may release both serotonin and nitric oxide.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Substance P-like immunoreactive amacrine cells in the cat <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Substance P-like immunoreactivity was localized by immunocytochemical techniques to two subpopulations of amacrine cells in the cat <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>. One cell was a unistratified amacrine with processes ramifying within <BrainRegion>stratum 4</BrainRegion> of the inner plexiform layer. The other cell type was a bistratified cell with processes in both <BrainRegion>stratum</BrainRegion> 1 (s1) and <BrainRegion>stratum 4</BrainRegion> (s4). Both cell types were seen with their somas displaced to the ganglion cell layer as well as in the conventional amacrine location in the inner nuclear layer. Substance P cells were present in the greatest density within the area centralis and decreased in number toward the periphery. The ratio of amacrine to displaced amacrine cells also decreased peripherally. However, the coverage by immunoreactive fibers in stratum 4(s4) remained three times that seen in <BrainRegion>stratum 1</BrainRegion>(s1) . Computer-assisted analysis confirmed the location of substance P-containing processes at 5-15% ( <BrainRegion>stratum 1</BrainRegion>(s1) ) and 50-70% ( <BrainRegion>stratum 4</BrainRegion>(s4) ) depth levels in the inner plexiform layer. A comparison of substance P-like immunoreactivity in light- and dark-adapted cat retinas showed no apparent differences in the distribution of immunoreactivity due to lighting conditions.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Immunocytochemical localization of opsin, visual arrestin, myosin III, and calmodulin in Limulus lateral eye <BrainRegion>retinular</BrainRegion> cells and ventral photoreceptors.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The photoreceptors of the horseshoe crab Limulus polyphemus are classical preparations for studies of the photoresponse and its modulation by circadian clocks. An extensive literature details their physiology and ultrastructure, but relatively little is known about their biochemical organization largely because of a lack of antibodies specific for Limulus photoreceptor proteins. We developed antibodies directed against Limulus opsin, visual arrestin, and myosin III, and we have used them to examine the distributions of these proteins in the Limulus visual system. We also used a commercial antibody to examine the distribution of calmodulin in Limulus photoreceptors. Fixed frozen sections of lateral eye were examined with conventional fluorescence microscopy; ventral photoreceptors were studied with confocal microscopy. Opsin, visual arrestin, myosin III, and calmodulin are all concentrated at the photosensitive rhabdomeral membrane, which is consistent with their participation in the photoresponse. Opsin and visual arrestin, but not myosin III or calmodulin, are also concentrated in extra-rhabdomeral vesicles thought to contain internalized rhabdomeral membrane. In addition, visual arrestin and myosin III were found widely distributed in the cytosol of photoreceptors, suggesting that they have functions in addition to their roles in phototransduction. Our results both clarify and raise new questions about the functions of opsin, visual arrestin, myosin III, and calmodulin in photoreceptors and set the stage for future studies of the impact of light and clock signals on the structure and function of photoreceptors.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Neural control of leg movements in a metamorphic insect: persistence of larval leg motor neurons to innervate the adult legs of Manduca sexta.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>During metamorphosis of the hawkmoth Manduca sexta, the larval thoracic legs along with their associated sensory organs and muscles degenerate and new adult legs develop. The larval legs are small and relatively simple structures capable of lateral extension and medial flexion allowing them to grasp the substrate as the caterpillar crawls along. By contrast, the adult legs are used for walking with an alternating gait. They are much larger than the larval legs and articulate such that they are capable of movement in several directions. This change in form and function is accompanied by a reorganization of the neural circuits controlling leg movements. In a previous report (Kent and Levine: J. Comp. Neurol. 271:559-576, &apos;88) we described motor neurons innervating the larval prothoracic legs, and here we describe motor neurons innervating the prothoracic legs of the adult. Using a combination of cobalt staining methods and the persistent fluorescent dye Fluoro-Gold, we have found that some, if not all, larval leg motor neurons are retained and innervate the new adult leg muscles. Moreover, we have been able to discover the fate of individual larval leg motor neurons by marking a single larval neuron with Fluoro-Gold and using a second fluorescent dye to double label the same neuron in the adult. Our results suggest that specific larval leg motor neurons innervate corresponding muscles in the adult stage, although their apparent function is significantly different. In addition, the motor neurons undergo significant remodeling of their dendritic branching patterns during metamorphosis, alterations which doubtless contribute to their new roles in adult behavior.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Neuropeptide Y in the <BrainRegion>forebrain</BrainRegion> of the adult male cichlid fish Oreochromis mossambicus: distribution, effects of castration and testosterone replacement.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>We studied the organization of the neuropeptide Y (NPY)-immunoreactive system in the <BrainRegion>forebrain</BrainRegion> of adult male cichlid fish Oreochromis mossambicus and its response to castration and testosterone replacement by using morphometric methods. Immunoreactivity for neuropeptide Y(NPY) was widely distributed in the <BrainRegion>forebrain</BrainRegion>, and the pattern generally resembled that in other teleosts. Whereas immunoreactivity was conspicuous in the ganglia of nervus terminalis (NT; or nucleus olfactoretinalis), a weak reaction was detected in some granule cells in the <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> and in the cells of <BrainRegion>area ventralis telencephali pars lateralis</BrainRegion> (Vl). Moderately to intensely immunoreactive cells were distinctly seen in the <BrainRegion>nucleus entopeduncularis</BrainRegion> (NE), <BrainRegion>nucleus preopticus</BrainRegion> (NPO), <BrainRegion>nucleus lateralis tuberis</BrainRegion> (NLT), <BrainRegion>paraventricular organ</BrainRegion> (PVO), and midbrain <BrainRegion>tegmentum</BrainRegion> (MT). neuropeptide Y(NPY) fibers were widely distributed in the <BrainRegion>forebrain</BrainRegion>. Castration for 10/15 days resulted in a drastic loss of immunoreactivity in the cells of <BrainRegion>nucleus entopeduncularis</BrainRegion>(NE) (P&amp;lt;0.001) and a significant decrease (P&lt;0.01) in their cell nuclear size. However, cell <BrainRegion>nuclei of the nervus terminalis</BrainRegion>(NT) neurons showed a significant increase in size. A highly significant reduction in the neuropeptide Y(NPY) -immunoreactive fiber density (P&amp;lt;0.001) was observed in several areas of the <BrainRegion>forebrain</BrainRegion>. Although testosterone replacement reversed these changes, fibers in some areas showed supranormal responses. Immunoreactive cells in <BrainRegion>ventralis telencephali pars lateralis</BrainRegion>(Vl) , <BrainRegion>nucleus preopticus</BrainRegion>(NPO) , <BrainRegion>nucleus lateralis tuberis</BrainRegion>(NLT) , <BrainRegion>paraventricular organ</BrainRegion>(PVO) , and midbrain <BrainRegion>tegmentum</BrainRegion>(MT) and fiber density in some other areas did not respond to castration. We suggest that the neuropeptide Y(NPY) -immunoreactive elements that respond to castration and testosterone replacement may serve as the substrate for processing the positive feedback action of the steroid hormone.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Distribution of transferrin binding protein immunoreactivity in the chicken central and peripheral nervous systems.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Transferrin binding protein (TfBP) is a glycoprotein originally purified from chicken oviduct that exhibits transferrin binding activity. Recent work has shown that Transferrin binding protein(TfBP) is a post-translationally modified form of the heat shock protein (HSP108), the avian homologue of a glucose regulated protein, GRP94. The function of this protein, however, has not yet been clearly defined. Antiserum to Transferrin binding protein(TfBP) was found to selectively stain oligodendrocytes of the avian brain. In this study, we further describe these oligodendrocytes and other cell types positive to anti- Transferrin binding protein(TfBP) in the chick nervous system. In accordance with previous studies, the most prominent cell type that labels with antiserum to Transferrin binding protein(TfBP) is the oligodendrocyte. At the electron microscopic level, the immunoreactive product is confined to the perinuclear cytoplasm and fine processes of the oligodendrocytes, whereas myelin and axoplasm are devoid of staining. The immunoreactive product is found both in the cytoplasmic matrix and bound to the endoplasmic reticulum and plasma membrane, suggesting that Transferrin binding protein(TfBP) may have properties of both a soluble and an integral membrane protein. There is great variability in the number of Transferrin binding protein(TfBP) -oligodendrocytes in different areas of the central nervous system (CNS); large numbers of cells are associated with the white matter regions and are found in the myelinated tracts, whereas few cells are present in the gray matter regions. In the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>, Transferrin binding protein(TfBP) is localized specifically in the cells, that are morphologically oligodendrocytic and is present in the optic nerve fiber layer and the ganglion cell layer. Obvious staining is also seen in the Bergmann glial cells of the <BrainRegion>cerebellum</BrainRegion> and in the Schwann cells of the sciatic nerve. Furthermore, the choroid plexus cells similarly exhibit a strong reaction. The association of Transferrin binding protein(TfBP) in these specific cell types responsible for myelination and sequestering iron and transferrin implies that Transferrin binding protein(TfBP) may be involved in myelination and iron metabolism of the chick nervous system, perhaps through a role in transferrin concentration in these cells. A putative role of Transferrin binding protein(TfBP) , as HSP108, is considered.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Somatotopic organization of the <BrainRegion>primary sensory trigeminal</BrainRegion> neurons in the hagfish, Eptatretus burgeri.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText><BrainRegion>Primary sensory trigeminal</BrainRegion> projections were investigated in the hagfish following application of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) to the sensory branches. In our control preparations we were able to distinguish five sensory ganglia and their respective nerves. horseradish peroxidase(HRP) application confirmed the almost exclusive relation of each of these nerves to their respective ganglia, with very little overlap. In normal frontal sections of the <BrainRegion>medulla oblongata</BrainRegion>, five columns of fibers surrounded by neuronal cell bodies could be clearly distinguished, but the number is probably fortuitous, for there was no one-on-one relationship with the five <BrainRegion>trigeminal</BrainRegion> ganglia. From their peripheral connections, we surmised that columns 1 and 3 handle general cutaneous sensation, columns 2, 4, and 5 handle taste sensation, and column 5 handles general mucous cutaneous sensation conveyed by utricular ganglion cells. Dorsally located columns received projections from nerves with dorsal peripheral connections, and more ventrally located columns received projections from nerves with ventral peripheral connections. This relation is the reverse of that seen in other vertebrates.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Improved immunohistochemical detection of postsynaptically located PSD-95/SAP90 protein family by protease section pretreatment: a study in the adult mouse brain.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Postsynaptic density (PSD)-95, SAP102, and Chapsyn-110 are members of the Postsynaptic density(PSD) -95/SAP90 protein family, which interact with the C-terminus of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor and shaker-type potassium channel subunits. Here we report that appropriate section pretreatment with pepsin has led to qualitative and quantitative changes in light microscopic immunohistochemical detection of the protein family. First, pepsin pretreatment lowered the concentration of affinity-purified primary antibodies, while it greatly increased the intensity of immunoreactions. Second, the resulting overall distributions of Postsynaptic density(PSD) -95, SAP102, and Chapsyn-110 in the adult mouse brain were consistent with their mRNA distributions. Third, instead of the reported patterns of somatodendritic labeling, tiny punctate staining in the neuropil became overwhelming. Fourth, many Postsynaptic density(PSD) -95-immunopositive puncta were apposed closely to synaptophysin-positive nerve terminals and overlapped with N-methyl-D-aspartate(NMDA) receptor subunits. By postembedding immunogold, the Postsynaptic density(PSD) -95 antibody was shown to label exclusively the postsynaptic density at asymmetrical synapses. Based on these results, we conclude that antibody access and binding to the postsynaptically located Postsynaptic density(PSD) -95/SAP90 protein family are hindered when conventional immunohistochemistry is adopted, and that pepsin pretreatment effectively unmasks the postsynaptic epitopes. On the other hand, Postsynaptic density(PSD) -95 in axon terminals of cerebellar basket cells, where high levels of potassium channels are present, was detectable irrespective of pepsin pretreatment, suggesting that Postsynaptic density(PSD) -95 antibody is readily accessible to the presynaptic epitopes. Consequently, the present immunohistochemical results have provided light microscopic evidence supporting the prevailing notion that the Postsynaptic density(PSD) -95/SAP90 protein family interacts with N-methyl-D-aspartate(NMDA) receptor subunits and potassium channel subunits.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Morphometric analysis of the effects of exenteration and enucleation on the development of third and sixth cranial nerves in the rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The effects on rat cranial nerve growth of removing various amounts of extraocular muscle was studied using morphometric techniques. Growth in the third cranial nerves was found to be severely retarded when most of the muscle tissue was removed. By contrast, removal of the eye alone, leaving extraocular muscles relatively intact, was found to have little or no effect on the subsequent growth of third and sixth cranial nerve fibers and of extraocular muscle fibers. This conclusion could be drawn only through the application of statistical methods which take into account several generally unrecognized facts: frequency distributions of axon circumference and myelin sheath thickness are highly variable from nerve to nerve even in normal rats, which often have more large fibers in left than in right nerves. The bimodal nature of peripheral nerve fiber distributions precludes the use of such parametric tests as the commonly and inappropriately used t-test, but a non-parametric test such as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, extensively used in these studies, is inadequate for data comprising several sets of distributions to be compared. The application of the analysis of variance to some of the data and the merits of the procedure are discussed.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Urotensin II in the central nervous system of the frog Rana ridibunda: immunohistochemical localization and biochemical characterization.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Urotensin II (UII) is traditionally regarded as a product of the neurosecretory cells in the <BrainRegion>caudal portion of the spinal cord</BrainRegion> of jawed fishes. A peptide related to Urotensin II(UII) has been recently isolated from the frog brain, thereby providing the first evidence that Urotensin II(UII) is also present in the central nervous system of a tetrapod. In the present study, we have investigated the distribution of Urotensin II(UII) -immunoreactive elements in the brain and <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> of the frog Rana ridibunda by immunofluorescence using an antiserum directed against the conserved cyclic region of the peptide. Two distinct populations of Urotensin II(UII) -immunoreactive perikarya were visualized. The first group of positive neurons was found in the <BrainRegion>nucleus hypoglossus of the medulla oblongata</BrainRegion>, which controls two striated muscles of the tongue. The second population of immunoreactive cell bodies was represented by a subset of motoneurons that were particularly abundant in the caudal region of the cord (34% of the motoneuron population). The <BrainRegion>telencephalon</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>diencephalon</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>mesencephalon</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>metencephalon</BrainRegion> were totally devoid of Urotensin II(UII) -containing cell bodies but displayed dense networks of Urotensin II(UII) -immunoreactive fibers, notably in the <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>tectum</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>tegmentum</BrainRegion>, and the granular layer of the <BrainRegion>cerebellum</BrainRegion>. In addition, a dense bundle of long varicose processes projecting rostrocaudally was observed coursing along the ventral surface of the brain from the <BrainRegion>midtelencephalon</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>medulla oblongata</BrainRegion>. Reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography analysis of frog brain, <BrainRegion>medulla oblongata</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> extracts revealed that, in all three regions, Urotensin II(UII) -immunoreactive material eluted as a single peak which exhibited the same retention time as synthetic frog Urotensin II(UII) . Taken together, these data indicate that Urotensin II(UII) , in addition to its neuroendocrine functions in fish, is a potential regulatory peptide in the central nervous system of amphibians.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Distributions of the mRNAs for L-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyrate-sensitive metabotropic glutamate receptors, mGluR4 and mGluR7, in the rat brain.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The distribution of mRNAs for metabotropic glutamate receptors, mGluR4 and mGluR7, which are highly sensitive for L-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyrate (L-AP4), was examined in the central nervous system of the rat by in situ hybridization. In general, the hybridization signals of mGluR7 mRNA were more widely distributed than those of mGluR4 mRNA, and differential expression of mGluR4 mRNA and mGluR7 mRNA was clearly indicated in some brain regions. Intense or moderate expression of mGluR4 mRNA was detected in the granule cells of the <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>cerebellum</BrainRegion>, whereas no significant expression of mGluR7 mRNA was found in these cells. In other neurons or regions where mGluR7 mRNA was intensely or moderately expressed, no significant expression of mGluR4 mRNA was observed. Such were the mitral and tufted cells of the <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>; <BrainRegion>anterior olfactory nucleus</BrainRegion>; <BrainRegion>neocortical regions</BrainRegion>; <BrainRegion>cingulate cortex</BrainRegion>; <BrainRegion>retrosplenial cortex</BrainRegion>; <BrainRegion>piriform cortex</BrainRegion>; <BrainRegion>perirhinal cortex</BrainRegion>; <BrainRegion>CA1</BrainRegion>; <BrainRegion>CA3</BrainRegion>; granule cells of the <BrainRegion>dentate gyrus</BrainRegion>; superficial layers of the <BrainRegion>subicular cortex</BrainRegion>; deep layers of the <BrainRegion>entorhinal</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>parasubicular</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>presubicular cortices</BrainRegion>; <BrainRegion>ventral part of the lateral septal nucleus</BrainRegion>; <BrainRegion>septohippocampal nucleus</BrainRegion>; <BrainRegion>triangular septal nucleus</BrainRegion>; <BrainRegion>nuclei of the diagonal band</BrainRegion>; <BrainRegion>bed nucleus of the stria terminalis</BrainRegion>; <BrainRegion>ventral pallidum</BrainRegion>; <BrainRegion>claustrum</BrainRegion>; <BrainRegion>amygdaloid nuclei</BrainRegion> other than the <BrainRegion>intercalated nuclei</BrainRegion>; <BrainRegion>preoptic region</BrainRegion>; <BrainRegion>hypothalamic nuclei</BrainRegion> other than the <BrainRegion>medial mammillary nucleus</BrainRegion>; <BrainRegion>ventral lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>; <BrainRegion>locus coeruleus</BrainRegion>; Purkinje cells; many nuclei of the <BrainRegion>lower brainstem</BrainRegion> other than the <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>interpeduncular nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>pontine nuclei</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>dorsal cochlear nucleus</BrainRegion>; and <BrainRegion>dorsal horn of the spinal cord</BrainRegion>. Both mGluR4 mRNA and mGluR7 mRNA were moderately or intensely expressed in the <BrainRegion>olfactory tubercle</BrainRegion>, superficial layers of the <BrainRegion>entorhinal cortex</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>CA4</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>septofimbrial nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>intercalated nuclei of the amygdala</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>medial mammillary nucleus</BrainRegion>, many <BrainRegion>thalamic nuclei</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>pontine nuclei</BrainRegion>. Intense expression of both mGluR4 mRNA and mGluR7 mRNA was further detected in the trigeminal ganglion and dorsal root ganglia, whereas no significant expression of them was found in the pterygopalatine ganglion and superior cervical ganglion. The results indicate differential roles of the L-AP4-sensitive metabotropic glutamate receptors in the glutamatergic nervous system.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Distribution of neurons projecting to the <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion> correlates with thick cytochrome oxidase stripes in macaque <BrainRegion>visual area V2</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>In <BrainRegion>visual area V2</BrainRegion> of macaque monkeys, cytochrome oxidase (CO) histochemistry reveals a pattern of alternating densely labeled thick and thin stripe compartments and lightly labeled interstripe compartments. This modular organization has been associated with functionally separate pathways in the visual system. We examined this idea further by comparing the pattern of cytochrome oxidase(CO) stripes with the distribution of neurons in <BrainRegion>V2</BrainRegion> that project to the <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion>. Visually evoked activity in the <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion> is known to be greatly reduced by blocking magnocellular but not parvocellular layers of the <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion> (LGN). From previous evidence that <BrainRegion>V2</BrainRegion> thick stripes are closely associated with the magnocellular <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(LGN) pathway, we predicted that a significant proportion of <BrainRegion>V2</BrainRegion> neurons projecting to the <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion> would reside in the thick stripes. To test this prediction, the tangential distribution of retrogradely labeled corticotectal cells in <BrainRegion>V2</BrainRegion> was compared with the pattern of cytochrome oxidase(CO) stripes. We found that neurons projecting to the <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion> accumulated preferentially into band-like clusters that were in alignment with alternate cytochrome oxidase(CO) dense stripes. These stripes were identified as thick stripes on the basis of their physical appearance and/or by their affinity to the monoclonal antibody Cat-301. A significantly smaller proportion of labeled cells was observed in thin and interstripe compartments. These data provide further evidence that the spatial distribution of <BrainRegion>subcortically</BrainRegion> projecting neurons can correlate with the internal modular organization of visual areas. Moreover, they support the notion that cytochrome oxidase(CO) compartments in <BrainRegion>V2</BrainRegion> are associated with functionally different pathways.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Somatosensory</BrainRegion> input to the <BrainRegion>ventrolateral thalamic region</BrainRegion> in the macaque monkey: potential substrate for parkinsonian tremor.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>In the present study, we determined the anatomic relationships between somatosensory and motor pathways within <BrainRegion>ventrolateral (VL) thalamic nuclei of the motor thalamus</BrainRegion> of macaque monkeys. In labeling experiments, four macaque monkeys (Macaca mulatta) received injections of biotinylated dextran amine and wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase into the <BrainRegion>cerebellar nuclei</BrainRegion> or <BrainRegion>internal segment of the globus pallidus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>cervical segments of the spinal cord</BrainRegion>, respectively. Each tracer was visualized in brain sections by sequentially using a different chromogen. Labeled terminals were plotted and superimposed on adjacent brain sections processed for Nissl substance, acetylcholinesterase, and the antigens for calbindin and Cat-301 to reveal <BrainRegion>thalamic nuclei</BrainRegion>. The labeled <BrainRegion>cerebellar</BrainRegion> terminals were distributed throughout the <BrainRegion>posterior ventrolateral</BrainRegion>(VL) ( ventrolateral(VL) p), whereas the labeled pallidothalamic terminals were concentrated in the <BrainRegion>anterior ventrolateral(VL) and the ventral anterior nucleus</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>spinothalamic</BrainRegion> input was directed mostly to the <BrainRegion>ventral posterior complex</BrainRegion> and cells just caudal to it. In addition, the patches of <BrainRegion>spinothalamic</BrainRegion> terminations intermingled and partly overlapped with the cerebellothalamic, but not with the pallidothalamic terminations within <BrainRegion>ventrolateral(VL) p</BrainRegion>. The regions of overlap of <BrainRegion>somatosensory</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>cerebellar</BrainRegion> inputs within the <BrainRegion>ventrolateral(VL) p</BrainRegion> of the present study appear to correspond to the reported locations of the tremor-related cells in parkinsonian patients. Thus, the overlapping <BrainRegion>spinothalamic</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>cerebellar</BrainRegion> inputs may provide a substrate for the altered activity of <BrainRegion>motor thalamic</BrainRegion> neurons in such patients.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Dependence of parvalbumin expression on Purkinje cell input in the <BrainRegion>deep cerebellar nuclei</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>A complete loss of Purkinje cell (PC) input leads to an increase in expression of the calcium-binding protein parvalbumin (Parv) in neurons of the <BrainRegion>deep cerebellar nuclei</BrainRegion> (DCN) of Purkinje cell(PC) degeneration (pcd) mutants. To verify this apparent dependence of parvalbumin(Parv) expression on Purkinje cell(PC) input in the <BrainRegion>deep cerebellar nuclei</BrainRegion>(DCN) , the patterns of expression in five other <BrainRegion>cerebellar</BrainRegion> mutants (weaver, staggerer, leaner, nervous, and lurcher) with differing grades and chronologies of Purkinje cell(PC) loss were compared. Degree and time course of Purkinje cell(PC) loss and the subsequent denervation of <BrainRegion>deep cerebellar nuclei</BrainRegion>(DCN) neurons were monitored by using Calbindin D-28k ( Calbindin D-28k(Calb) ) immunocytochemistry. Similar to PC degeneration(pcd) mice, somatal parvalbumin(Parv) in lurcher mutants increased massively throughout the <BrainRegion>cerebellar nuclei</BrainRegion>. In nervous and leaner mutants, somatal parvalbumin(Parv) was restricted to almost completely denervated nuclear areas, whereas areas with appreciable remnants of Purkinje cell(PC) input were spared. The first appearance of parvalbumin(Parv) + somata was closely correlated with the time course of Purkinje cell(PC) degeneration--postnatal day 19 in lurcher mutants and postnatal day 23 in nervous mutants. In staggerer mice, neurons immunopositive for parvalbumin(Parv) as well as for Calbindin D-28k(Calb) were present in <BrainRegion>outer deep cerebellar nuclei(DCN) areas</BrainRegion>, likely representing ectopic Purkinje cell(PC) s rather than <BrainRegion>deep cerebellar nuclei</BrainRegion>(DCN) neurons. No parvalbumin(Parv) + <BrainRegion>deep cerebellar nuclei</BrainRegion>(DCN) somata were found in weaver mutants at any time. In conclusion, increased expression of somatal parvalbumin(Parv) in <BrainRegion>deep cerebellar nuclei</BrainRegion>(DCN) neurons is not restricted to the specific histopathology in PC degeneration(pcd) mutants but is a common mechanism that is dependent on the topography and severeness of Purkinje cell(PC) -input loss. The functional significance of the parvalbumin(Parv) increase and its possible contribution to the degree of motor disability among the different mutants are discussed.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Morphological and physiological comparisons of two types of allatostatin in the brain and <BrainRegion>retrocerebral complex</BrainRegion> of the tomato moth, Lacanobia oleracea (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae).</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The cellular localisation of two types of allatostatin in the brain and <BrainRegion>retrocerebral complex</BrainRegion> has been studied in larvae of Lacanobia oleracea (Noctuidae) using antisera against Manduca sexta allatostatin (Mas-AS) and two members of the Y/FXFGL-NH(2) allatostatin family. The axons of two groups of Manduca sexta allatostatin(Mas-AS) -immunoreactive neurosecretory cells in the <BrainRegion>pars lateralis</BrainRegion> form part of the <BrainRegion>nervi corporis cardiaci</BrainRegion> (NCC 1). They exit the brain as the combined <BrainRegion>N cardiaca(CC) 1</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>N cardiaca(CC) 2</BrainRegion> and pass through the <BrainRegion>corpora cardiaca</BrainRegion> ( cardiaca(CC) ), where they divide to innervate the <BrainRegion>corpora allata</BrainRegion> (CA) and the mandibular (salivary) gland. The presence of Manduca sexta allatostatin(Mas-AS) immunoreactivity in the <BrainRegion>corpora allata</BrainRegion>(CA) is consistent with the inhibitory action of this peptide on juvenile hormone (JH) biosynthesis in L. oleracea. Immunoreactivity in the mandibular gland nerve suggests an additional, as yet unidentified role for this peptide. Cells of the pars intermedialis, the main contributors to <BrainRegion>N cardiaca(CC) 2</BrainRegion>, do not show Manduca sexta allatostatin(Mas-AS) immunoreactivity. The distribution of Y/FXFGL-NH(2) immunoreactivity is different from that of Manduca sexta allatostatin(Mas-AS) . Although there are fewer cells in the <BrainRegion>pars lateralis</BrainRegion>, immunoreactivity is observed in certain neurones of the <BrainRegion>pars intermedialis</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>tritocerebrum</BrainRegion>. Axons of these latter neurones contribute to <BrainRegion>N cardiaca(CC) 2</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>N cardiaca(CC) 3</BrainRegion>, respectively, and, combined with those from <BrainRegion>N cardiaca(CC) 1</BrainRegion>, result in the prominent occurrence of Y/FXFGL-NH(2) immunoreactivity in the cardiaca(<BrainRegion>CC</BrainRegion>) , particularly in the storage lobe. The <BrainRegion>corpora allata</BrainRegion>(CA) has far less Y/FXFGL-NH(2) immunoreactivity compared with Manduca sexta allatostatin(Mas-AS) . In bioassays, the Y/FXFGL-NH(2) allatostatins did not inhibit juvenile hormone(JH) synthesis by <BrainRegion>corpora allata</BrainRegion>(CA) of L. oleracea.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Development of the brachial lateral motor column in the wingless mutant chick embryo: motoneuron survival under varying degrees of peripheral load.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Survival of motoneurons in the lateral motor column (LMC) of the chick embryo is known to depend on the periphery. How this dependence relates to the normally occurring death of motoneurons is unknown. Analysis of the time course of lateral motor column(LMC) cell loss in the absence of varying amounts of limb musculature could help bring about an understanding of this relationship. We undertook this analysis by studying lateral motor column(LMC) development in wingless chick embryos. Grossly these embryos lack wings, but we have reported that some of them possess more than 40% of the normal volume of wing bud-derived muscles (M.E. Lanser and J.F. Fallon, Anat. Rec. 217:61-78, 1987). In the present work we compared the time course of lateral motor column(LMC) development in wingless embryos that possessed varying amounts of wing bud-derived musculature with that in normal embryos. In normal embryos little cell loss occurs from the brachial lateral motor column(LMC) prior to day 8 (15% of the total cell loss). Most of the normal cell loss occurs between 8 and 10 days (62% of the total cell loss). In the wingless lateral motor column(LMC) , anywhere from 55% to 70% of the total cell loss occurs before day 8. The death of motoneurons prior to day 8 is proportional to the amount of wing bud musculature eliminated by the mutation. Cell loss after day 8 is proportional to the amount of wing bud musculature spared by the mutation. Therefore, when the limb is missing, most motoneurons die before the major period of cell loss even begins in the normal lateral motor column(LMC) . Counts of dead cells in the lateral motor column(LMC) also support this conclusion. In addition, curves plotting the rates at which cells are lost from the brachial lateral motor column(LMC) provide a suggestion that normal cell loss is biphasic and that limb removal enhances primarily the first phase of cell loss. These data suggest that the majority of motoneurons may die for different reasons in the normal and the limb-deprived lateral motor column(LMC) s. Overall, the number of motoneurons surviving in the brachial lateral motor column(LMC) is proportional to the volume of wing bud-derived muscle present. However, as the muscle volume approaches zero, motoneuron number does not. This suggests that most, but not all, motoneurons depend on limb bud-derived muscles for survival. Finally, the decreased motoneuron number in the wingless lateral motor column(LMC) , when compared to normal after the cell death period, cannot be totally accounted for by the additional loss of cells that occurred during the cell death period in the wingless lateral motor column(LMC) .(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Progressive morphological abnormalities observed in rat <BrainRegion>spinal</BrainRegion> motor neurons at extended intervals after axonal regeneration.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>It is generally accepted that mammalian spinal motor neurons return to normal after axotomy if their regenerated axons successfully reinnervate appropriate peripheral targets. However, morphological abnormalities, recently observed in <BrainRegion>spinal</BrainRegion> motor neurons examined 1 year after nerve crush injury, raise the possibility that delayed perikaryal changes occur after regeneration is complete. In order to distinguish between chronic and progressive alterations in neurons with long-term regenerated axons, rat <BrainRegion>spinal</BrainRegion> motor neurons and dorsal root ganglion cells were examined at 5 and 10 months following unilateral sciatic nerve crush. Neurons with regenerated axons were identified by retrograde labelling with horseradish peroxidase. The structural properties of neurons ipsilateral to nerve injury were compared to those of neurons from the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> and dorsal root ganglia on the contralateral side and from age-matched control rats. At 5 months postcrush, the morphology of motor and sensory neurons ipsilateral to injury was comparable to that of control cells. However, several features of the motor neurons with regenerated axons distinguished them from control motor neurons at 10 months postcrush. Mean perikaryal area of ipsilateral spinal motor neurons was larger than the means for control motor neurons (p less than .001). Ipsilateral <BrainRegion>spinal</BrainRegion> motor neurons also appeared clustered within the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> and had thicker dendrites. Dorsal root ganglion cells with regenerated axons were slightly larger than control cells at 10 months postcrush but they exhibited no other morphological changes. The present findings indicate that <BrainRegion>spinal</BrainRegion> motor neurons are progressively altered after their regenerated axons have reestablished functional synapses with their peripheral targets.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Metabotropic glutamate receptor subtypes in axon terminals of projection fibers from the <BrainRegion>main and accessory olfactory bulbs</BrainRegion>: a light and electron microscopic immunohistochemical study in the rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Localization of metabotropic glutamate receptor subtypes, mGluR1, mGluR1alpha, mGluR2/3, mGluR4a, mGluR5, mGluR7a, mGluR7b, and mGluR8, was examined in some of the target areas of projection fibers from the <BrainRegion>main and accessory olfactory bulbs</BrainRegion> (MOB and AOB) by using subtype-specific antibodies. The superficial layer of the olfactory tubercle and layer Ia of the piriform cortex, the target areas of MOB, showed marked mGluR1-, mGluR5-, mGluR7a-, and mGluR8-like immunoreactivities (-LI), and rather weak mGluR2/3-LI. The <BrainRegion>periamygdaloid cortical region</BrainRegion> including the target areas of both <BrainRegion>MOB</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>AOB</BrainRegion> showed intense mGluR2/3-LI as well as marked mGluR1-, mGluR5-, mGluR7a-, and mGluR8-LI. No significant mGluR1alpha-, mGluR4a-, or mGluR7b-LI was seen in these regions. After transection of the lateral olfactory tract, mGluR2/3-, mGluR7a-, and mGluR8-LI were reduced markedly in the target regions on the side ipsilateral to the transection; no significant changes were detected in mGluR1- or mGluR5-LI. Double labeling experiments indicated light and electron microscopically colocalization of mGluR7a- and mGluR8-LI in axon terminals on dendritic shafts of presumed interneurons in the superficial layer of the <BrainRegion>olfactory tubercle</BrainRegion> and layer Ia of the <BrainRegion>piriform cortex</BrainRegion>. Electron microscopically mGluR2/3-LI was seen in preterminal and terminal portions of axons, whereas mGluR7a- and mGluR8-LI were associated with presynaptic membrane specialization. Immunolabeled axon terminals were filled with round synaptic vesicles and constituted asymmetric synapses with dendritic profiles. The results suggest that glutamate release from axon terminals of projection fibers from <BrainRegion>MOB</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>AOB</BrainRegion> is regulated presynaptically and differentially through mGluR2/3, mGluR7a, and/or mGluR8.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>The organization of the pudendal nerve in the male and female rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Mature male and female Sprague-Dawley rats were used in this study to compare the organization of the pudendal nerve in the two sexes. Experiments included incubating the cut pudendal nerve in diamidino-2-phenylindole HCl (DAPI), fast blue (FB), or horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and injecting individual perineal muscles with these substances. In both sexes, incubation of the pudendal nerve labelled two motoneuron nuclei in the L5-L6 segments of the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>. These nuclei are the <BrainRegion>dorsomedial (DM) and dorsolateral (DL) cell columns</BrainRegion> described by Schrøder (J. Comp. Neurol. 192:567-587, 1980). In agreement with previous studies, there were significantly more neurons in both nuclei in the male than in the female and the neurons were larger in the male. In both sexes, the <BrainRegion>dorsolateral(DL) and dorsomedial(DM) nuclei</BrainRegion> were characterized by a longitudinal dendritic structure. The <BrainRegion>dorsomedial(DM) nucleus</BrainRegion> also had numerous dendritic bundles extending across the midline, linking the <BrainRegion>dorsomedial(DM) nuclei</BrainRegion> bilaterally. Pudendal nerve afferent neurons were located in the L6 and S1 dorsal root ganglia. In the male, the afferent neurons were larger and more numerous. In both sexes, labelled pudendal afferent fibers in the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> were located in the <BrainRegion>dorsal columns</BrainRegion>, the medial half of Lissauer&apos;s tract, the <BrainRegion>extreme medial edge of the dorsal horn</BrainRegion>, both ipsilaterally and contralaterally, and in a large terminal field in the <BrainRegion>dorsal gray commissure</BrainRegion>. No labelled afferents were seen in the <BrainRegion>intermediate or ventral gray</BrainRegion>. Perineal muscle injections established that there was no difference between males and females in the number of motoneurons innervating the external anal or urethral sphincters. In the female, urethral sphincter motoneurons accounted for almost all the dorsolateral(DL) motoneurons, and anal sphincter motoneurons accounted for almost all the dorsomedial(DM) motoneurons. The ischiocavernosus and bulbospongiosus muscles are vestigial in the female rat. In the male, neurons innervating the anal sphincter and bulbospongiosus muscles were intermingled in the <BrainRegion>dorsomedial(DM) nucleus</BrainRegion>. In contrast, in the <BrainRegion>dorsolateral(DL) nucleus</BrainRegion>, the urethral sphincter neurons were located in the lateral portion of the nucleus and the ischiocavernosus neurons were located in the medial portion.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Origin of ascending projections to an isofrequency region of the mustache bat&apos;s <BrainRegion>inferior colliculus</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The <BrainRegion>inferior colliculus</BrainRegion> of the mustache bat is similar in most respects to the <BrainRegion>inferior colliculus</BrainRegion> of more commonly studied mammals, but one isofrequency contour, the <BrainRegion>dorsoposterior division</BrainRegion>, is greatly overrepresented. The present study utilizes this specialization of the auditory system in the mustache bat to determine the total set of ascending projections to a single isofrequency contour of the <BrainRegion>inferior colliculus</BrainRegion>. Within the <BrainRegion>dorsoposterior division</BrainRegion>, neurons are all very narrowly tuned to 60 kHz, the major component of this bat&apos;s echolocation call. The afferent projections to this isofrequency contour were identified by making deposits of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) within the <BrainRegion>dorsoposterior division</BrainRegion> after physiologically defining its borders. Two other frequency representations are present in the <BrainRegion>central nucleus of the inferior colliculus</BrainRegion> of the mustache bat, the <BrainRegion>anterolateral division</BrainRegion> in which there is an orderly progression of frequencies from 59 down to 20 kHz, and the <BrainRegion>medial division</BrainRegion> in which frequencies from 63-120 kHz are represented. In additional experiments, the afferent projections to the <BrainRegion>medial and anterolateral divisions</BrainRegion> were examined, providing an anatomical description of the tonotopicity of the <BrainRegion>lower auditory nuclei</BrainRegion>. Deposits of horseradish peroxidase(HRP) in the DPD labeled cells in each of the <BrainRegion>lower brainstem auditory nuclei</BrainRegion> that have previously been shown to project to the entire <BrainRegion>central nucleus of the inferior colliculus</BrainRegion>. The ascending projections to the <BrainRegion>dorsoposterior division</BrainRegion> include contralateral projections from the <BrainRegion>cochlear nucleus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>inferior colliculus</BrainRegion>, ipsilateral projections from the <BrainRegion>medial superior olive</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>ventral and intermediate nuclei of the lateral lemniscus</BrainRegion>, and bilateral projections from the <BrainRegion>lateral superior olive</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>dorsal nucleus of the lateral lemniscus</BrainRegion>. In most of the nuclei, labeled cells were confined to specific portions of the nuclei, often forming &quot;slabs" of labeled cells across the rostrocaudal extent of most nuclei. These slabs presumably represent the 60 kHz representation in each of the lower nuclei. When deposits of horseradish peroxidase(HRP) were made into other frequency band representations of the <BrainRegion>inferior colliculus</BrainRegion>, in either the <BrainRegion>medial or anterolateral division</BrainRegion>, labeled cells again formed slabs in each lower nucleus. However, the location of the slab varied as a function of the best frequency of neurons at the deposit site, and labeled cells were not present within the 60 kHz representation. These results show the general tonotopy of the mustache bat&apos;s <BrainRegion>brainstem auditory nuclei</BrainRegion>, and with respect to the <BrainRegion>dorsoposterior division</BrainRegion>, clearly reveal the total set of projections to a single isofrequency region.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Astrocyte subtypes in the rat <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>: morphological heterogeneity and differential laminar distribution.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Despite increased recognition of the importance and heterogeneity of astrocyte functions throughout the central nervous system (CNS) relatively little attention has been paid to morphological diversity among astrocytes. Recent studies have indicated that subsets of astrocytes are involved in glial-axonal interactions critical to both development and reinnervation of the rat <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>. Here, we have characterized the morphologies and distribution of astrocytes within anatomically and functionally distinct layers of the adult <BrainRegion>main olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> (MOB). Using a known immunohistochemical marker for astrocytes, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and the classic gold sublimate method, we identified six astrocyte subtypes based on their morphology and distribution: (1) unipolar, (2) irregular, (3) wedge-shape, (4) circular, (5) semicircular, and (6) elongate. Unipolar, irregular and wedge-shape astrocytes have not been previously described in the central nervous system(CNS) . The unipolar and irregular types are located exclusively in the <BrainRegion>olfactory nerve</BrainRegion> layer. Wedge-shape astrocytes are unique to, and are the major subtype in, the glomerular layer. These three morphologically unique astrocyte subtypes may correspond to <BrainRegion>olfactory nerve</BrainRegion> layer (ONL) and glomerular layer (GL) astrocytes, which express molecules that regulate axonal growth or synaptogenesis during development and/or regeneration of the olfactory nerve. In the glomerular layer, astrocytes are highly organized with respect to the glomeruli. Individual astrocytes are loyal to a single glomerulus. In the external plexiform layer, astrocytes are spaced relatively uniformly. In the granule cell layer, astrocytes appear to compartmentalize granule cell aggregates, recently shown to be coupled by tight junctions. The distribution and patterns of astrocyte processes and the density of glial fibrillary acidic protein(GFAP) immunoreactivity are distinctive for each of the layers of the <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>. The spacing of astrocytes and the organization of their processes may be important to compartmentalization of neuronal functions. High levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein(GFAP) immunoreactivity correlated with layers of high neuronal plasticity. The morphological diversity and differential distribution of astrocytes in the <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> reported here support growing evidence for functional diversity of astrocytes and important interactions among specific astrocyte and neuron subtypes. It is reasonable to hypothesize, therefore, that as for neurons, morphologically distinctive astrocyte subtypes may correspond to functionally specific classes.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Zona incerta</BrainRegion>: Substrate for contralateral interconnectivity in the <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion> of rats.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>We have shown previously that the <BrainRegion>zona incerta</BrainRegion> (ZI), a small nucleus deriving from the <BrainRegion>ventral thalamus</BrainRegion>, has extensive ipsilateral connections with the higher order and <BrainRegion>intralaminar nuclei of the dorsal thalamus</BrainRegion> and that there are many ipsilateral interconnections between the different cytoarchitectonic sectors of the <BrainRegion>zona incerta</BrainRegion>(ZI) . In this study, we explore the contralateral connections that the <BrainRegion>zona incerta</BrainRegion>(ZI) has with its opposing nucleus as well as with the other <BrainRegion>nuclei of the thalamus</BrainRegion>. Injections of biotinylated dextran or cholera toxin subunit B were made into each of the different <BrainRegion>zona incerta</BrainRegion>(ZI) sectors (rostral, dorsal, ventral, and caudal) and into intralaminar and higher order <BrainRegion>dorsal thalamic nuclei</BrainRegion> of Sprague-Dawley rats by using stereotaxic coordinates. Brains were fixed in aldehyde and processed using standard methods. Our results show that, after injections limited to a given <BrainRegion>zona incerta</BrainRegion>(ZI) sector, labelled terminal-like elements and cells were seen across the other sectors of the <BrainRegion>zona incerta</BrainRegion>(ZI) of the contralateral side. Furthermore, after each of these <BrainRegion>zona incerta</BrainRegion>(ZI) injections, labelling was seen in the <BrainRegion>intralaminar (e.g., parafascicular, central lateral, and central medial)</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>higher order (e.g., posterior thalamic, lateral posterior, and lateral dorsal) nuclei</BrainRegion> of the contralateral side. These patterns of labelling were confirmed after tracer injections into <BrainRegion>intralaminar and higher order nuclei</BrainRegion>; after such injections, labelling was seen in the <BrainRegion>contralateral zona incerta</BrainRegion>(ZI) . In all cases, there was labelling on the ipsilateral side as well, and this was generally heavier than on the contralateral side. Overall, our results indicate that there is a network of interconnections between the <BrainRegion>zona incerta</BrainRegion>(ZI) of both sides of the <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion> and that the <BrainRegion>zona incerta</BrainRegion>(ZI) has contralateral connections with the <BrainRegion>intralaminar and higher order nuclei</BrainRegion>. Hence, the <BrainRegion>zona incerta</BrainRegion>(ZI) furnishes a substrate that spreads activity to both sides of the brain.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Rules for retinotectal terminal arborizations in the goldfish <BrainRegion>optic tectum</BrainRegion>: a whole-mount study.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText><BrainRegion>Retinal</BrainRegion> axons were labeled in the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>optic nerve</BrainRegion> with horseradish peroxidase and traced in <BrainRegion>tectal</BrainRegion> whole-mounts. The typical network formed by <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> fibers in the five retinorecipient layers of <BrainRegion>tectum</BrainRegion> is illustrated in camera lucida drawings. Three size classes of terminal arbors were identified in the <BrainRegion>Stratum fibrosum et griseum superficiale</BrainRegion> (SFGS)-ca. 34 X 52, ca. 103 X 150, and ca. 158 X 274 micron. Terminal arbors are flattened and occupy three sublayers of <BrainRegion>Stratum fibrosum et griseum superficiale</BrainRegion>(SFGS) . Passing an HRP-coated needle through the <BrainRegion>optic nerve</BrainRegion> labeled ganglion cells in <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> and axons and terminal arbors in <BrainRegion>tectum</BrainRegion>. Terminal arbors of axons that originated in <BrainRegion>retinal annuli</BrainRegion> lay in distinct annular regions in <BrainRegion>Stratum fibrosum et griseum superficiale</BrainRegion>(SFGS) , with old generations from <BrainRegion>central retina</BrainRegion> lying central to younger generations from <BrainRegion>peripheral retina</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>tectal annuli</BrainRegion> were concentric with one another and agreed with the retinotopic map as it had been described before. The youngest terminal arbors from <BrainRegion>peripheral retina</BrainRegion> were next to the path of their fascicle along the <BrainRegion>tectal periphery</BrainRegion>, connected to their fascicle by short, centrally directed extrafascicular axons. The oldest terminal arbors from <BrainRegion>central retina</BrainRegion> were caudally displaced from their rostral fascicle of entrance, at the end of long, caudally directed extrafascicular axons. Terminal arbors from <BrainRegion>intermediate retina</BrainRegion> occupied intermediate positions in the <BrainRegion>tectum</BrainRegion>. Rostrally, they arose from centrocaudally directed extrafascicular axons but caudally from axons of various orientations. Terminal arbors arising from those extrafascicular axons exhibited different orientations and shapes depending on their <BrainRegion>tectal</BrainRegion> position. The spatial order of intratectal paths and terminal arbor sites, and the variability of terminal arbor orientation and shape, are consistent with an earlier model on shifting retinotectal terminals (Easter and Stuermer, &apos;84).</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Developmental changes in the expression of gamma-aminobutyric acidA/benzodiazepine receptor subunit mRNAs in the murine <BrainRegion>inferior olivary complex</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The pharmacological and physiological properties of ligand-gated ion channels are dependent on their subunit composition; spontaneously occurring changes in subunit composition during neuronal development may result in dramatic functional differences between embryonic and adult forms of the receptor complex. In the present study, in situ hybridization with antisense cRNA probes was used to examine the subunit composition of the gamma-aminobutyric acidA/benzodiazepine (GABAA/BZ) receptor in the developing <BrainRegion>inferior olivary complex</BrainRegion>. This receptor is thought to be a pentameric chloride channel comprised of selected alpha, beta, gamma, delta, and rho subunits, the majority of which have several isoforms: alpha 1-6, beta 1-4, gamma 1-4, and rho 1,2. Among the 13 subunit variants present in the mammalian central nervous system, alpha 2-5, beta 3, and gamma 1,2 mRNAs are expressed at significant levels in the <BrainRegion>inferior olivary complex</BrainRegion>. Two clearly different temporal patterns of gamma-aminobutyric acidA/benzodiazepine(GABAA/BZ) receptor subunit mRNA expression were observed: The expression of alpha 3, alpha 5, beta 3, and gamma 2 mRNAs was at a peak during embryonic and early postnatal development followed by rapid down-regulation thereafter. Conversely, alpha 2, alpha 4, and gamma 1 mRNA expression was very low or absent during early development, and a pronounced increase was observed at the end of postnatal week 1. These studies suggest that there are developmental changes in the subunit composition of the gamma-aminobutyric acidA/benzodiazepine(GABAA/BZ) receptor in <BrainRegion>inferior olivary</BrainRegion> neurons. These changes in subunit expression, which occur during a period of major alterations in afferent and efferent synaptic connections, may subserve a change in the role of GABA from its function as a neurotrophic factor to that of an inhibitory neurotransmitter.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Collateral sprouting of the central terminals of cutaneous primary afferent neurons in the rat <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>: pattern, morphology, and influence of targets.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The capacity of the central terminals of primary afferents to sprout into denervated areas of neonatal <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> and the morphology of any novel terminals has been investigated. In rats which had undergone sciatic nerve section on the day of birth, 12 of 18 physiologically characterized intact saphenous hair follicle afferents (HFAs) were labelled intra-axonally with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) were shown to sprout up to 2,000 microns into the deafferented sciatic terminal field. The morphology of these sprouts depended on which area of the sciatic nerve territory was invaded by the afferent sprouts. Six hair follicle afferents(HFAs) sprouted into areas normally innervated by glabrous skin afferents and the morphology of the collateral sprouts in this region resembled that of rapidly adapting (RA) afferents. The other six saphenous hair follicle afferents(HFAs) had sprouted into sciatic &quot;hairy" skin areas and the morphology of these sprouts, although abnormal, was flame shaped. In rats whose sural, saphenous, and superficial peroneal nerves were cut at birth, 4 of 7 single horseradish peroxidase(HRP) labelled rapidly adapting(RA) afferents had central terminals that had sprouted into regions of cord normally devoted to "hairy" input. These showed clear signs of HFA morphology despite their peripheral receptive fields remaining in the glabrous skin. The results show collateral sprouting of single cutaneous sensory afferent axons into adjacent inappropriate central target regions following neonatal deafferentation. Such plasticity may provide some compensation following neonatal injury. The morphology of the sprouted terminals is appropriate to the new target area rather than to its functional class and is also independent of the peripheral receptive field location providing an example of central rather than peripheral control over afferent growth patterns.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Early postnatal development of glial cells in the canine cervical spinal cord.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>To study qualitative and quantitative changes in the glial cell population of young postnatal dogs, the cervical spinal cords of 20 beagle pups, ranging in age from 1 to 28 days, were prepared for light and electron microscopy. Glial cells in the lateral corticospinal tract were classified and quantified directly on the electron microscope. Quantification was performed by means of a stereological method designed to correct for sampling bias, and glia were classified according to morphological criteria as immature glial cell precursors, light and dark oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and microglia. Glial cell precursors, which include undifferentiated glioblasts, oligodendroblasts, and astroblasts, predominated in the first few days after birth, constituting 43% of the glial cell population, and then declined to less than 5% by 28 days. Light and dark oligodendrocytes differed morphologically in their electron density and the appearance of their organelles. Light oligodendrocytes increased slightly prior to myelination, and then declined, whereas dark oligodendrocytes continued to increase throughout the 4-week period and became the predominant cell type at 28 days (66%). In contrast to the oligodendroglial population, the sizes of the astroglial and microglial cell populations were relatively stable. This study shows that the population of immature glial cell precursors, abundant at birth in the lateral corticospinal tract, appear to be differentiating primarily into oligodendroglia, because this population exhibits a rapid increase in size, and relatively little change occurs in the astrocyte population. The trends in glial cell development in the dog are similar to those reported for rodents, although there may be some variation in the maturation and activity of oligodendrocytes.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Catecholaminergic innervation of the sympathetic preganglionic cell column of the filefish Stephanolepis cirrhifer.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Nerve fibers immunoreactive for enzymes synthesizing catecholamines were examined in the <BrainRegion>central autonomic nucleus</BrainRegion>, a column of sympathetic preganglionic neurons, in the filefish Stephanolepis cirrhifer. Varicose nerve fibers immunoreactive for tyrosine hydroxylase were densely distributed in the rostral part, sometimes in contact with perikarya but were sparse in the caudal part of this nucleus. Fluorescent double labeling distinguished noradrenergic nerve fibers immunoreactive for both tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine beta hydroxylase, and dopaminergic fibers immunoreactive only for tyrosine hydroxylase. In the <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion>, catecholaminergic neurons were observed in the <BrainRegion>locus coeruleus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>caudal dorsomedial reticular zone of the medulla</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>area postrema</BrainRegion>. Double labeling of tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine beta hydroxylase showed that the neurons in the <BrainRegion>locus coeruleus</BrainRegion> were all noradrenergic, and those in the <BrainRegion>caudal dorsomedial medulla</BrainRegion> were mostly noradrenergic, whereas the <BrainRegion>area postrema</BrainRegion> contained both noradrenergic and dopaminergic neurons. No catecholaminergic neurons were found in the <BrainRegion>ventral region of the brainstem</BrainRegion>. After application of DiI to the <BrainRegion>central autonomic nucleus</BrainRegion>, retrogradely labeled neurons were seen in the <BrainRegion>caudal dorsomedial medulla</BrainRegion> but not in the <BrainRegion>locus coeruleus</BrainRegion> or the <BrainRegion>area postrema</BrainRegion>. These findings suggest that the sympathetic preganglionic neurons of the filefish may receive noradrenergic axonal projections from neurons in the <BrainRegion>caudal dorsomedial medulla</BrainRegion>. In the light of previous studies, inputs of these catecholaminergic fibers to the <BrainRegion>central autonomic nucleus</BrainRegion> may be involved in regulation of sympathetic activity of peripheral organs, together with serotoninergic and peptidergic inputs to this nucleus.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Immunocytochemical localization of the GABA(C) receptor rho subunits in the cat, goldfish, and chicken <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Polyclonal antibodies against the N-terminus of the rat rho1 subunit were used to study the distribution of gamma-aminobutyric acid C (GABA(C)) receptors in the cat, goldfish, and chicken <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>. Strong punctate immunoreactivity was present in the inner plexiform layer (IPL) of all three species. The punctate labelling suggests a clustering of the GABA(C) receptors at synaptic sites. Weak label was also found in the outer plexiform layer (OPL) and over the cell bodies of bipolar cells. Double immunostaining of vertical sections with an antibody against protein kinase C (PKC) showed the punctate immunofluorescence to colocalize with bipolar cell axon terminals. In the goldfish <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>, the axon terminals of Mb1 bipolar cells were enclosed by rho-immunoreactive puncta. In the chicken <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>, several distinct strata within the inner plexiform layer(IPL) showed a high density of rho-immunoreactive puncta. The results suggest a high degree of sequence homology between the rho subunits of different vertebrate species, and they show that the <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> localization of GABA(C) receptors is similar across different species.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Septotemporal distribution of <BrainRegion>entorhinal</BrainRegion> projections to the <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion> in the cat: electrophysiological evidence.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The projection of the <BrainRegion>entorhinal cortex</BrainRegion> (EA) to the <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion> in the cat has been studied by electrophysiological methods. Field potentials elicited by <BrainRegion>entorhinal cortex</BrainRegion>(EA) stimulation sites were measured in the <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>fascia dentata</BrainRegion>). Different topographic distributions of the amplitude and of the onset latency of average evoked potentials (AEPs) were obtained depending on the place of the stimulation along a lateromedial axis in the <BrainRegion>Ea</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>lateral entorhinal cortex</BrainRegion>(EA) elicited the largest average evoked potentials(AEPs) in the <BrainRegion>septal part of the hippocampus</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>medial entorhinal cortex</BrainRegion>(EA) evoked maximal responses in the <BrainRegion>temporal part of the hippocampus</BrainRegion>, while the <BrainRegion>intermediate part of the entorhinal cortex</BrainRegion>(EA) evoked the largest average evoked potentials(AEPs) in the <BrainRegion>splenial (intermediate) part of the hippocampus</BrainRegion>. Unit activity elicited by <BrainRegion>hippocampal</BrainRegion> stimulation was measured in the <BrainRegion>entorhinal cortex</BrainRegion>(EA) . Analysis of the antidromic unit activity showed that the pathways analysed were monosynaptic. Different conduction velocities to the s<BrainRegion>eptal part of the hippocampus</BrainRegion> were found; the pathway from the <BrainRegion>lateral entorhinal cortex</BrainRegion>(EA) was the fastest and the pathway from the <BrainRegion>medial entorhinal cortex</BrainRegion>(EA) the slowest. Assuming that the sites of maximal AEP amplitude correspond to the location of the major synaptic inputs, it can be concluded that the active synaptic inputs arising along a <BrainRegion>latero-medial axis in the entorhinal cortex</BrainRegion>(EA) are distributed within the <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion> according to a septotemporal axis, although with some overlap between the different projections. Therefore it may be concluded that the <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion> is not homogeneous with respect to the inputs from the <BrainRegion>entorhinal cortex</BrainRegion>(EA) . The present observations are discussed regarding anatomical data and putative functional differences between <BrainRegion>septal and temporal hippocampus</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Expression of the transcription factors GATA3 and Pax2 during development of the mammalian <BrainRegion>inner ear</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The transcription factors GATA3 and Pax2 are expressed throughout development of the mouse <BrainRegion>inner ear</BrainRegion>. We have used antibodies to study their temporal and spatial expression patterns from embryonic days E8-E16.5. The two factors show reciprocal relationships in the regional patterning of the early otocyst and cellular patterning within the sensory epithelia. GATA3 is expressed in the whole <BrainRegion>otic placode</BrainRegion> at E8. In the otocyst at E9.5-10.5, the distribution is lateral and complementary to the medial expression pattern of Pax2. Only Pax2 is expressed in the endolymphatic duct, but both factors are expressed in the <BrainRegion>cochlea</BrainRegion>. At E11.5-13.5, GATA3 is expressed strongly in the <BrainRegion>cochlea</BrainRegion>, but in the dorsal, vestibular region it is downregulated. In all sensory epithelia, downregulation coincides with sensory innervation. Pax2 is expressed in all sensory and some nonsensory epithelia, but within sensory epithelia at E16.5 it is restricted to hair cells. GATA3 is expressed throughout key periods of cell proliferation, fate determination, and differentiation and is not specifically associated with any of these processes. Expression persists most strongly in the main components of the developing auditory system. These include the auditory sensory epithelium, the afferent and efferent nerves, and the mesenchymal and ectodermal cells in regions that form key parts of the <BrainRegion>middle and outer ear</BrainRegion>. GATA3 is thus expressed in functionally distinct groups of cells that integrate to form a complete sensory system. The results suggest that both factors may be involved in tissue compartmentalisation, morphogenesis, and cell signalling.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Distributions of mRNAs for alpha-2 adrenergic receptor subtypes in rat brain: an in situ hybridization study.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Selective 35S-labeled oligonucleotide probes were designed to sequences of the rat alpha-2A (RG20), alpha-2B (RNG), and alpha-2C (RG10) adrenoreceptor mRNAs for use in in situ hybridization experiments on sections of unfixed rat brain, <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> and kidney. After hybridized sections were exposed to film or dipped in autoradiographic emulsion, specific and selective labeling patterns characteristic for each probe and region of the central nervous system were observed. Alpha-2A mRNA labeling was most pronounced in neurons in layer six of the <BrainRegion>cerebral cortex</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>reticular thalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>pontine nuclei</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>locus coeruleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>vestibular nuclei</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>trapezoid nuclei</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>deep cerebellar nuclei</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>nucleus tractus solitarii</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>ventrolateral medullary reticular formation</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>intermediolateral cell column of the thoracic spinal cord</BrainRegion>. In some of these locations, the receptor mRNA, in all probability, is present in noradrenaline and perhaps adrenaline neurons. The alpha-2B probe, which primarily labels the kidney, gave only a very light signal in the <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion> in the central nervous system after extended exposure times. Alpha-2C mRNA labeling was primarily observed in the <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>, c<BrainRegion>erebral cortex</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>islands of Calleja</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>striatum</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>hippocampal formation</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>cerebellar cortex</BrainRegion>, and dorsal root ganglia. Labeling patterns disappeared when excess unlabeled probes were added to their respective radiolabeled probes, or when sense probes were employed. When a hybrid antisense probe homologous to all three alpha-2 probes was used, labeling patterns also disappeared. The present study therefore justifies the pharmacological subclassification of alpha-2 receptors by providing anatomical evidence for specific and selective cell groups in the rat central nervous system containing mRNA for three alpha-2 receptor subtypes.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Gustatory innervation and bax-dependent caspase-2: participants in the life and death pathways of mouse taste receptor cells.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>In the adult mouse tongue, an average of 11% of the gustatory receptor cells are replaced each day. In investigating homeostatic cell death mechanisms in gustatory renewing epithelium, we observed that taste receptor cells were selectively immunopositive for the bcl-2 family death factor, Bax, and for the protease Caspase-2 (Nedd2/Ich1). We determined that 8-10% of the taste receptor cells of the vallate papilla were Bax positive and that 11% were Caspase-2 positive. Some of these immunopositive taste cells had apoptotic morphological defects. Within the subset of vallate taste cells immunopositive for either Caspase-2 or Bax, up to 79% coexpressed both death factors. Bax and Caspase-2 first appeared in occasional vallate taste receptor cells on the same postnatal day-the day after birth. bax null mutation markedly reduced gustatory Caspase-2 immunoexpression. These observations suggest that taste cell death pathways utilize p53, Bax, and Caspase-2 to dispose of aged receptor cells. Apart from reducing Caspase-2 expression, Bax deficiency also altered taste organ development. bax(-/-) mice had a more profusely innervated vallate papilla, which grew to be 25% longer and taller, with the mean taste bud containing more than twice the normal number of taste cells. This augmentation of taste organ development with increased innervation is complementary to the well-documented reduction in taste organ development with sparse innervation. We propose that additional taste neurons survived programmed cell death in Bax-deficient mice, thereby providing an inductive boost to vallate gustatory development.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>The role of <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion> in vision: visual form discrimination in cats with <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion> ablations.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The rate of acquisition of visual form discriminations in cats with <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion> damage was measured in a testing apparatus requiring a minimal amount of stimulus localization in space. In animals with <BrainRegion>bilateral superior colliculus</BrainRegion> ablations, acquisition was imparied relative to acquisition in normal animals. In these animals, the extent of the lesion was related to the severity of the deficit. In split-brain preparations with <BrainRegion>unilateral superior colliculus</BrainRegion> ablations, acquisition with the eye ipsilateral to the lesion was impaired relative to acquisition with eye contralateral to the lesion. The deficits observed did not depend upon damage to <BrainRegion>pretectum</BrainRegion>. The results support the conclusion that the superior colliculus participates in certain aspects of form vision.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Zebrin II immunoreactivity in the rat and in the weakly electric teleost Eigenmannia (gymnotiformes) reveals three modes of Purkinje cell development.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Monoclonal antibody (mab) anti-zebrin II recognizes a single 36-kD polypeptide in Purkinje cells in the rat and fish <BrainRegion>cerebellum</BrainRegion>. In the adult rat, zebrin II+ Purkinje cells form, in each <BrainRegion>hemicerebellum</BrainRegion>, seven parasagittal bands interposed by zebrin II- bands. We show that, in rats, immunoreactivity first appears caudally at postnatal day 5 and spreads; all Purkinje cells are labelled by postnatal day 12. Subsequently, immunoreactivity is selectively lost so that by day 18 the adult pattern of zebrin II+/-immunoreactive bands is created. This pattern indicates two types of Purkinje cells according to developmental trajectory, zebrin II-/+/-. In the adult gymnotiform teleost Eigenmannia, Purkinje cells in the <BrainRegion>corpus cerebelli</BrainRegion> (CCb), <BrainRegion>lateral valvula cerebelli</BrainRegion> (VCbl), and <BrainRegion>eminentia granularis anterior</BrainRegion> (EGa) are zebrin II+. Purkinje cells in the <BrainRegion>eminentia granularis posterior (EGp) and medialis</BrainRegion> (EGm) and the <BrainRegion>medial valvula cerebelli</BrainRegion> (VCbm) are zebrin II-. Zebrin II antigenicity is first present at 6 days postspawning (P6) in the <BrainRegion>eminentia granularis anterior</BrainRegion>(EGa) and at P8 in the <BrainRegion>corpus cerebelli</BrainRegion>(CCb) . In the valvula, labelling does not appear until P29. Immunoreactivity in the <BrainRegion>corpus cerebelli</BrainRegion>(CCb) , <BrainRegion>VCBl</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>eminentia granularis anterior</BrainRegion>(EGa) persists in the adult, whereas in the <BrainRegion>VCbm</BrainRegion> Purkinje cells become zebrin II- before reaching adulthood. These developmental histories (zebrin II-/+ and zebrin II-/+/-) correspond to the patterns of Purkinje cell development in mammals. Additionally, Eigenmannia has a third class of Purkinje cells, in the <BrainRegion>eminentia granularis posterior</BrainRegion>(EGp) and <BrainRegion>EGm</BrainRegion>, that never express zebrin II immunoreactivity, indicating that zebrin II expression is not an obligatory feature of Purkinje cell development in all vertebrates.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Effect of nerve crush on perikaryal number and volume of neurons in adult rat dorsal root ganglion.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Assumption-free stereological methods were applied to assess the effect of nerve crush on perikaryal number and mean volume of neuronal subpopulations in adult rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG). The L5 spinal nerve of 20 Wistar rats was crushed approximately 7 mm distal to the dorsal root ganglion(DRG) , and the <BrainRegion>contralateral spinal nerve</BrainRegion> and dorsal root ganglion(DRG) were left intact and used as controls. After four, 15, 45, and 120 days, the rats were killed, and the tissue was fixed and processed for subsequent preparation of 30-microm-thick sections. Estimates of neuron number were obtained with the optical fractionator technique and estimates of the mean perikaryal volume with the vertical planar rotator principle. Perikaryal loss was progressive during the early study period but stabilized 45 days after nerve injury. The mean number (n) of all neurons in intact L5 dorsal root ganglion(DRG) was 16,400 (S.D. = 2,000). The loss of perikarya was 16% (P &amp;lt; 0.05) after four days, 15% (P &lt; 0.05) after 15 days, 30% (P = 0.059) after 45 days, and 34% (P &lt; 0. 05) after 120 days. B cells were lost at an earlier time than were A cells, and the B cell loss was more pronounced (39% vs. 22%, respectively, after 120 days). For A cells, the mean perikaryal volume was initially reduced but was normalized at the end of the study. Distributions of perikaryal volume showed that the curves of both A and B cells were uniformly displaced toward smaller values 15 and 45 days after injury. Neuronal loss caused by crush seems similar to that seen in rats exposed to permanent axotomy (Vestergaard et al. [1997] J Comp Neurol 388:307-312) at the same location, indicating that survival of perikarya is not dependent on possibility for fiber growth.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> core is a rich source of neural progenitor and stem cells in adult rodent and human.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> (OB) core is an extension of the rostral migratory stream and thus is a potential source of neural progenitor and neural stem cells. We characterized in vivo and in vitro neuronal progenitor and neural stem cells in the adult <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>(OB) core. In mouse and rat, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling showed that the <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>(OB) core accumulates newly replicated cells. Nestin, a neuroepithelial stem cell marker, was enriched in the <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>(OB) core. bromodeoxyuridine(BrdU) -positive cells were immunolabeled for nestin and TUC4, a marker for early postmitotic neurons. The distributions of cells labeled for bromodeoxyuridine(BrdU) , TUC4, and nestin were similarly concentrated in the <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>(OB) core. Nestin- and TUC4-positive cells were also found in the <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>(OB) of young and aged humans. Isolated and cultured <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>(OB) core cells from adult rat and mouse had the capacity to generate numerous neurospheres. Adult <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>(OB) core neurospheres were cryopreserved and subsequently cultured. Single cell clonal analysis of neurospheres revealed the capacity for self-renewal and multipotency. Cultured adult <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>(OB) core cells differentiated into neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. Some neurons expressed choline acetlytransferase, substance P, and glutamic acid decarboxylase. Basic fibroblast growth factor potentiated the self-renewal of cells and beta-nerve growth factor stimulated differentiation. <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>(OB) -derived neural stem cells in coculture with skeletal muscle cells were induced to become neurons expressing choline acetyltransferase and substance P and formed neuromuscular synaptic junctions on myocytes displaying acetylcholinesterase-positive motor end plates. Cocultured <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>(OB) -derived neural stem cells with myoblast cells also generated nonneural cell progeny. We conclude that the adult mammalian <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>(OB) core is a reservoir of neural progenitor cells and pluripotent neural stem cells.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Distribution of noradrenaline immunoreactivity in the <BrainRegion>forebrain</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>midbrain</BrainRegion> of the lizard Gekko gecko.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The distribution of noradrenaline (NA) immunoreactivity in the <BrainRegion>forebrain</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>midbrain</BrainRegion> of the lizard Gekko gecko was studied by means of recently developed antibodies against noradrenaline(NA) . Noradrenaline-containing cell bodies are found in the <BrainRegion>hypothalamic periventricular organ</BrainRegion> and ependymal wall of the <BrainRegion>infundibular recess of the diencephalon</BrainRegion>. They are also present in the <BrainRegion>locus coeruleus</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion> of the <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion>. Noradrenaline-immunoreactive ( noradrenaline(NA) i) fibers and varicosities are widely, but not uniformly, distributed throughout the <BrainRegion>forebrain</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>midbrain</BrainRegion>. In the <BrainRegion>telencephalon</BrainRegion>, dense plexuses of noradrenaline(NA) i fibers are found in the <BrainRegion>bed nucleus of the medial forebrain bundle</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>vertical limb of the nucleus of the diagonal band of Broca</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>caudoventral part of the septal region</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>diencephalon</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>periventricular preoptic area</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>supraoptic nucleus</BrainRegion>, and, in particular, the <BrainRegion>medial habenular nucleus</BrainRegion> are densely innervated by noradrenaline(NA) i fibers, whereas in the <BrainRegion>midbrain</BrainRegion> noradrenaline(NA) i plexuses are found in the <BrainRegion>ventral tegmental area</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>substantia nigra</BrainRegion> and its dorsolateral extension (RA8), and in an area ventral to the <BrainRegion>nucleus interpeduncularis, pars ventralis</BrainRegion>. Moderately dense plexuses of noradrenaline(NA) i fibers are found in the small-celled medial cortex, the <BrainRegion>dorsal cortex</BrainRegion>, and the midbrain <BrainRegion>tectum</BrainRegion>. The remaining <BrainRegion>forebrain</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>midbrain</BrainRegion> areas are generally not or only sparsely innervated by noradrenaline(NA) i fibers. The distribution of noradrenaline(NA) i cell bodies and fibers resembles the pattern revealed with antibodies against dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH). A remarkable exception is that the cells in the <BrainRegion>hypothalamic periventricular organ</BrainRegion> and ependymal wall of the <BrainRegion>infundibular recess</BrainRegion> are immunonegative for dopamine-beta-hydroxylase(DBH) . Possible explanations for this discrepancy are discussed. The present study on the distribution of noradrenaline(NA) immunoreactivity in the brain of Gekko gecko combined with the results of a previous report on the distribution of dopamine in the same species (Smeets et al., &apos;86b) offer the opportunity to differentiate between the two catecholamines in the brain of this vertebrate.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Cholinergic innervation of the chick basilar papilla.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Antibodies directed against choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), the synthesizing enzyme for acetylcholine (ACh) and a specific marker of cholinergic neurons, were used to label axons and nerve terminals of efferent fibers that innervate the chick basilar papilla (BP). Two morphologically distinct populations of cholinergic fibers were labeled and classified according to the region of the basilar papilla(BP) they innervated. The inferior efferent system was composed of thick fibers that coursed radially across the basilar membrane in small fascicles, gave off small branches that innervated short hair cells with large cup-like endings, and continued past the inferior edge of the basilar papilla(BP) to ramify extensively in the hyaline cell area. The superior efferent system was made up of a group of thin fibers that remained in the superior half of the epithelium and innervated tall hair cells with bouton endings. Both inferior and superior efferent fibers richly innervated the basal two thirds of the basilar papilla(BP) . However, the apical quarter of the chick basilar papilla(BP) was virtually devoid of efferent innervation except for a few fibers that gave off bouton endings around the peripheral edges. The distribution of choline acetyltransferase(ChAT) -positive efferent endings appeared very similar to the population of efferent endings that labeled with synapsin antisera. Double labeling with choline acetyltransferase(ChAT) and synapsin antibodies showed that the two markers colocalized in all nerve terminals that were identified in basilar papilla(BP) whole-mounts and frozen sections. These results strongly suggest that all of the efferent fibers that innervate the chick basilar papilla(BP) are cholinergic.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Pallidothalamic projections in the rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The purpose of this investigation was to examine pallidofugal projections to the <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion> of the rat using a selective silver degeneration method and autoradiography. Degenerating pallidothalamic projections emerging from the <BrainRegion>anterior part of the pallidum</BrainRegion> formed two diffuse groups of fibers; one coursed ventromedially directly through the <BrainRegion>internal capsule</BrainRegion> without forming a lenticular fasciculus and terminated uniformly in the reticular, VA, VD, VM and the medial part of the VE. The otehr group coursed ventrolaterally in the <BrainRegion>internal capsule</BrainRegion> and, without forming an ansa lenticularis, entered the <BrainRegion>zona incerta</BrainRegion>, swept medially through and ventral to the medial lemniscus, and terminated in the medial part of the VE and throughout the VD.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor alpha-immunoreactivity in the monkey central nervous system.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) sustains the viability and phenotypic expression of a variety of neuronal populations in the central nervous system. Cranial and <BrainRegion>spinal</BrainRegion> motor neurons are particularly sensitive to the trophic effects of Ciliary neurotrophic factor(CNTF) , and clinical trials are underway testing the potential therapeutic value of this trophic factor in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Yet, the distribution of the alpha subunit of the receptor for ciliary neurotrophic factor ( Ciliary neurotrophic factor(CNTF) R alpha), which is essential for the trophic effects of Ciliary neurotrophic factor(CNTF) to occur, is unknown in any primate species. Towards this end, the present study used a polyclonal antibody directed against Ciliary neurotrophic factor(CNTF) R alpha to evaluate the distribution of Ciliary neurotrophic factor(CNTF) R alpha-immunoreactive (-ir) cells within the brain and <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> of Cebus apella monkeys. Ciliary neurotrophic factor(CNTF) R alpha-ir was found exclusively within neurons. In the anterior horn of the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>, virtually all motor neurons were darkly immunoreactive for Ciliary neurotrophic factor(CNTF) R alpha. A similar pattern of Ciliary neurotrophic factor(CNTF) R alpha-ir was seen within all <BrainRegion>cranial motor nuclei</BrainRegion> with general somatic efferent function (<BrainRegion>III, IV, motor V, VI, VII, and XII cranial nerves</BrainRegion>). Ciliary neurotrophic factor(CNTF) R alpha-ir was also seen in other regions involved with motor function including the Purkinje cells of the <BrainRegion>cerebellum</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>substantia nigra pars compacta</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>red nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>dorsal motor nucleus of X cranial nerve</BrainRegion>, and giant neurons of sensory motor <BrainRegion>neocortex</BrainRegion>. A few Ciliary neurotrophic factor(CNTF) R alpha-ir neurons were seen within the <BrainRegion>globus pallidus</BrainRegion> with concomitant terminal-like staining within the <BrainRegion>subthalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>. Autonomic regions such as the <BrainRegion>mesencephalic nucleus of the trigeminal nerve</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>interomedial lateral cell column of the thoracic spinal cord</BrainRegion> also contained Ciliary neurotrophic factor(CNTF) R alpha-ir neurons. Finally, the hippocampus displayed dense Ciliary neurotrophic factor(CNTF) R alpha-ir within the pyramidal cell layer of the <BrainRegion>hippocampal formation</BrainRegion> and the granule cell layer of the <BrainRegion>dentate gyrus</BrainRegion>. The dense expression of this Ciliary neurotrophic factor(CNTF) R alpha protein within regions subserving motor, autonomic, and sensory functions suggests that Ciliary neurotrophic factor(CNTF) R alpha supports many central nervous system regions with diverse functions.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Central gustatory paths in the crucian carp, Carassius carassius.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The central fiber connections of the gustatory system (<BrainRegion>VII, IX, and X nerves</BrainRegion>) in th crucian carp were examined by the Fink-Heimer method and its modification. The sensory and recurrence roots of the <BrainRegion>VII</BrainRegion> enter th <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion> separately and terminate in teh <BrainRegion>ipsilateral half of the facial lobe</BrainRegion> (L-VII). Afferent fibers of the <BrainRegion>IX</BrainRegion> terminate in the <BrainRegion>glossopharyngeal lobe</BrainRegion> (L-IX). Most afferent fibers of the <BrainRegion>X</BrainRegion> terminate in the sensory layer of the <BrainRegion>vagal lobe</BrainRegion> (L-X), in which degenerating terminals occur in some laminae. Some vagal afferents project bilaterally to the <BrainRegion>commissural nucleus of Cajal</BrainRegion>. The cutaneous component of the <BrainRegion>X</BrainRegion> projects to the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the spinal trigeminal tract</BrainRegion> (SpV) and the <BrainRegion>medial funicular nucleus</BrainRegion> (nFM). Ascending secondary fibers from the <BrainRegion>L-VII</BrainRegion> project bilaterally to the <BrainRegion>secondary gustatory nucleus</BrainRegion> (nGS) in the isthmus region. Descending secondary fibers from the <BrainRegion>L-VII</BrainRegion> turn caudally in the <BrainRegion>SpV</BrainRegion>. These fibers terminate mostly in the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the SpV</BrainRegion>  and sparsely in the <BrainRegion>nFM</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>L-IX</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>L-X</BrainRegion> give rise to the long and short secondary paths. The long path projects as the ascending secondary tract to the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral nGs</BrainRegion>. The short path includes secondary fibers projecting to the motor layer of the <BrainRegion>L-X</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>medullary reticular formation</BrainRegion>. Teritary gustatory fibers arisig in the <BrainRegion>nGs</BrainRegion> project ipsilaterally to two <BrainRegion>diencephalic nuclei</BrainRegion>; the <BrainRegion>nucleus glomerulosus</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>nucleus diffusus lobi inferioris</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Programmed cell death during the earliest stages of <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> development in the chick embryo: a possible means of early phenotypic selection.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The spatiotemporal distribution of cell death in the chick embryo <BrainRegion>neural tube</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> (brachial region) was examined between stage (St.) 12 and 22, in plastic semithin sections. Between stage(St.) 12 and 16, the total number of pycnotic cells per segment was low, whereas after stage(St.) 16 the number of pycnotic cells was substantially increased. Between stage(St.) 17 and 19 three cell death foci or regions could be recognized. One region, the dorsal pycnotic zone, was located in the most dorsal part of the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>, including the <BrainRegion>neural crest</BrainRegion>, with the highest number of pycnotic cells observed at stage(St.) 18. The second region, or ventral pycnotic zone, was located between motoneurons and the floor plate and had the highest number of dying cells at stage(St.) 17. The third region, the floor plate pycnotic zone, was located in the midportion of the floor plate and had the greatest amount of cell death at stage(St.) 19. Although low numbers of pycnotic cells were also observed in other regions between stage(St.) 17 and 19, no pycnotic cells were found in the ventrolateral region that gives rise to motoneurons. Ultrastructural observations as well as data from in situ nick end labeling indicate that the pycnotic cells observed in the neural tube die by apoptosis and that the debris from the dead cells is phagocytized primarily by adjacent healthy neuroepithelial cells. Although the spatiotemporal distribution of pycnotic cells suggests that cell death at these early stages could play a role in establishing the pioneer axonal pathway for <BrainRegion>spinal</BrainRegion> commissural neurons, preliminary observations following perturbations of cell death do not support this notion. Alternatively, early cell death may be involved in the regulation of cellular patterning along the dorsoventral axis of the <BrainRegion>neural tube</BrainRegion> by a kind of negative selection of specific progenitor cells.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Projections of the <BrainRegion>oval nucleus of the hyperstriatum ventrale</BrainRegion> in the budgerigar: relationships with the auditory system.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The afferent and efferent projections of a <BrainRegion>vocal control nucleus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>oval nucleus of the hyperstriatum ventrale</BrainRegion> (HVo), were mapped out in a parrot, the budgerigar (Melopsittacus undulatus) to determine the relationships of this nucleus to the auditory system. In budgerigars, <BrainRegion>HVo</BrainRegion> is connected to both the <BrainRegion>anterior forebrain</BrainRegion> pathway as well as to nuclei forming the descending projection system to the <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion> (Durand et al. [1997] J. Comp. Neurol. 377:179-206). Previous studies (Brauth et al. [1997] Proc. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 807:368-385; Durand and Brauth [1998] Neurosci Abstr 24:78.9) indicate that <BrainRegion>HVo</BrainRegion> lesions disrupt vocal performance and that <BrainRegion>HVo</BrainRegion> neurons show long latency electrophysiologic auditory responses. <BrainRegion>HVo</BrainRegion> has also been shown to receive input from neurons in the immediately adjacent <BrainRegion>HV</BrainRegion> (Durand et al. [1997] J. Comp. Neurol. 377:179-206). Thus, the focus of the present study was to elucidate relationships between <BrainRegion>HVo</BrainRegion>, its immediately adjacent surround and <BrainRegion>telencephalic auditory nuclei</BrainRegion>. The results show that, although the <BrainRegion>lateral and medial portions of HVo</BrainRegion> are interconnected with one another, inputs to these areas and their surrounds are distinctively different. The most substantial auditory system inputs are derived from the <BrainRegion>frontal lateral neostriatum</BrainRegion> (NFl) and <BrainRegion>supracentral nucleus of the lateral neostriatum</BrainRegion> (NLs); these project primarily to the <BrainRegion>lateral HVo</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>lateral HVo</BrainRegion> surround. The <BrainRegion>medial HVo</BrainRegion> and surround receive only sparse or modest input from <BrainRegion>auditory nuclei</BrainRegion>, including the <BrainRegion>caudomedial neostriatum</BrainRegion> (NCM), <BrainRegion>neostriatum intermedium pars lateralis</BrainRegion> (NIL), Fields L1 and L3, and the <BrainRegion>neostriatum intermedium pars ventrolateralis</BrainRegion> (NIVL). Other sources of input to the <BrainRegion>HVo</BrainRegion> surround include the <BrainRegion>hyperstriatum accessorium</BrainRegion> (HA), the <BrainRegion>supralaminar area of the frontal neostriatum</BrainRegion> (NAs), the <BrainRegion>ventral anterior archistriatum</BrainRegion> (AAv), the <BrainRegion>medial archistriatum</BrainRegion> (Am) and the <BrainRegion>medial HV</BrainRegion>. Neurons in the <BrainRegion>HV</BrainRegion> immediately medial to <BrainRegion>HVo</BrainRegion> project to a shell region around the entire nucleus. Both the <BrainRegion>ventral paleostriatum</BrainRegion> (VP) and <BrainRegion>ventral part of the central nucleus of the lateral neostriatum</BrainRegion> (NLc) project to <BrainRegion>HVo</BrainRegion> but not to the surround. Previously described projections (Durand et al., 1997) from <BrainRegion>HVo</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>NAom</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>NLc</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>magnicellular nucleus of the lobus parolfactorius</BrainRegion> (LPOm) were confirmed.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Abnormal expression of the G-protein-activated inwardly rectifying potassium channel 2 (GIRK2) in <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>frontal cortex</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>substantia nigra</BrainRegion> of Ts65Dn mouse: a model of Down syndrome.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Ts65Dn, a mouse model of Down syndrome (DS), demonstrates abnormal <BrainRegion>hippocampal</BrainRegion> synaptic plasticity and behavioral abnormalities related to spatial learning and memory. The molecular mechanisms leading to these impairments have not been identified. In this study, we focused on the G-protein-activated inwardly rectifying potassium channel 2 (GIRK2) gene that is highly expressed in the <BrainRegion>hippocampus region</BrainRegion>. We studied the expression pattern of GIRK subunits in Ts65Dn and found that GIRK2 was overexpressed in all analyzed Ts65Dn brain regions. Interestingly, elevated levels of GIRK2 protein in the Ts65Dn <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>frontal cortex</BrainRegion> correlated with elevated levels of GIRK1 protein. This suggests that heteromeric GIRK1-GIRK2 channels are overexpressed in Ts65Dn <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>frontal cortex</BrainRegion>, which could impair excitatory input and modulate spike frequency and synaptic kinetics in the affected regions. All GIRK2 splicing isoforms examined were expressed at higher levels in the Ts65Dn in comparison to the diploid <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion>. The pattern of GIRK2 expression in the Ts65Dn mouse brain revealed by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry was similar to that previously reported in the rodent brain. However, in the Ts65Dn mouse a strong immunofluorescent staining of GIRK2 was detected in the lacunosum molecular layer of the <BrainRegion>CA3 area</BrainRegion> of the <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion>. In addition, tyrosine hydroxylase containing dopaminergic neurons that coexpress GIRK2 were more numerous in the <BrainRegion>substantia nigra compacta</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>ventral tegmental area</BrainRegion> in the Ts65Dn compared to diploid controls. In summary, the regional localization and the increased brain levels coupled with known function of the GIRK channel may suggest an important contribution of GIRK2 containing channels to Ts65Dn and thus to Down syndrome(DS) neurophysiological phenotypes.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Single <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> neurons project to both <BrainRegion>lateral suprasylvian visual cortex</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>area 17</BrainRegion>: a retrograde fluorescent double-labeling study.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText><BrainRegion>Area 17</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>posteromedial lateral suprasylvian (PMLS) visual cortex</BrainRegion> receive inputs from three <BrainRegion>thalamic nuclei</BrainRegion> in common: the <BrainRegion>lateral division of the lateral posterior nucleus</BrainRegion> (LPl), the <BrainRegion>C-laminae of the lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion> (LGNd), and the <BrainRegion>medial interlaminar nucleus</BrainRegion> (MIN). The present study determined whether these projections originate from the same cells via bifurcating axons or from separate populations of cells. Double-label retrograde transport techniques were used to label cells projecting to <BrainRegion>area 17</BrainRegion> with one fluorescent dye and to label cells projecting to <BrainRegion>posteromedial lateral suprasylvian(PMLS) cortex</BrainRegion> with a different dye. The two dyes used were fast blue and Evans blue. Following injections into the two <BrainRegion>cortical areas</BrainRegion>, some cells were double labeled and some were single labeled in all three <BrainRegion>thalamic nuclei</BrainRegion> studied. However, the relative number of double- and single-labeled cells, as well as the relative number of cells single-labeled following injections into each <BrainRegion>cortical area</BrainRegion>, differed among the three <BrainRegion>thalamic nuclei</BrainRegion>. In both <BrainRegion>medial interlaminar nucleus</BrainRegion>(MIN) and the <BrainRegion>C-laminae of the LGNd</BrainRegion>, the number of double-labeled cells was small. Similarly, the number of cells single labeled with the dye placed in <BrainRegion>posteromedial lateral suprasylvian(PMLS) cortex</BrainRegion> was small in these two nuclei. In contrast, a relatively large number of cells were single labeled with the dye placed in <BrainRegion>area 17</BrainRegion>, especially in the <BrainRegion>C-laminae of the LGNd</BrainRegion>. These results suggest that in both <BrainRegion>medial interlaminar nucleus</BrainRegion>(MIN) and the <BrainRegion>C-laminae of the LGNd</BrainRegion>, few cells project to both <BrainRegion>area 17</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>posteromedial lateral suprasylvian(PMLS) cortex</BrainRegion>, few cells project only to <BrainRegion>posteromedial lateral suprasylvian(PMLS) cortex</BrainRegion>, and a relatively greater number of cells project only to <BrainRegion>area 17</BrainRegion>. In <BrainRegion>lateral posterior nucleus</BrainRegion>(LPl) , many cells were labeled after the <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> injections. In fact, when the areas of densest labeling for both dyes overlapped, almost every labeled cell in <BrainRegion>lateral posterior nucleus</BrainRegion>(LPl) was double labeled. This indicates that almost all <BrainRegion>lateral posterior nucleus</BrainRegion>(LPl) cells that project to one <BrainRegion>cortical area</BrainRegion> also project to the other via a bifurcating axon.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Codistribution of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit alpha3 and beta4 mRNAs during rat brain development.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>We have used in situ hybridization to characterize the ontogeny of alpha3 and beta4 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunit mRNA expression in rat brain. Transcripts for both subunits were detected in embryonic brain, although overlapping expression of alpha3 mRNA was only evident in areas of strong beta4 mRNA expression, including the <BrainRegion>medial habenula</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>locus coeruleus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>cerebellar primordium</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>several motor and sensory brainstem nuclei</BrainRegion>. During the perinatal period, the independent expression of alpha3 mRNA declined, and greater correspondence in the temporal and spatial expression of alpha3 and beta4 subunit mRNAs emerged. In general, beta4 mRNA expression preceded that of alpha3 mRNA by 1 to 2 days. Overlapping expression patterns were transiently detected in the <BrainRegion>caudate putamen</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>basal forebrain</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>frontal and visual cortices</BrainRegion>, and in the <BrainRegion>CA3 field of hippocampus</BrainRegion>. Codistribution that lasted throughout development and into adulthood was noted in a number of brain areas, including the <BrainRegion>retrosplenial cortex</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>subiculum</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>medial habenula</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>interpeduncular nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>locus coeruleus</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>brainstem motor nuclei</BrainRegion>. In many of these regions, alpha5 subunit mRNA was also expressed. Colocalization of alpha3 and beta4 mRNAs with choline acetyltransferase mRNA was detected in cholinergic neurons of the <BrainRegion>brainstem motor nuclei</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>nucleus ambiguus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>motor trigeminal nucleus</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>facial nucleus</BrainRegion>, but not in most <BrainRegion>forebrain</BrainRegion> cholinergic cells. The extensive correspondence in temporal and spatial distribution of alpha3 and beta4 mRNAs throughout postnatal brain development suggests that these subunits may be coordinately regulated and may form functional neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor(nAChR) s with significant developmental roles.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Intracellular labeling of <BrainRegion>auditory nerve</BrainRegion> fibers in guinea pig: central and peripheral projections.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Auditory-nerve fibers (ANFs) in the cat have been subdivided according to spontaneous rate (SR), with high- spontaneous rate(SR) fibers showing the lowest thresholds. <BrainRegion>Cochlear</BrainRegion> terminals of the three spontaneous rate(SR) groups differ in caliber and synaptic position around the inner hair cell (Liberman [1982b] Science 216:1239-1241); central terminals differ in degree of branching and in which subregions of the <BrainRegion>cochlear nucleus</BrainRegion> (CN) are targeted (Liberman [1991] J. Comp. Neurol. 313:240-258). The present study investigates whether these spontaneous rate(SR) -based differences in ANF connections are unique to the cat. Thirty <BrainRegion>Auditory-nerve</BrainRegion> fibers(ANFs) from 15 guinea pigs were intracellularly labeled after measuring characteristic frequency, threshold, and spontaneous rate(SR) . Labeled cochlear projections showed significant spontaneous rate(SR) -based differences in axonal caliber, with low- and medium- spontaneous rate(SR) fibers 20-40% thinner than those of high- spontaneous rate(SR) fibers for both peripheral and central (modiolar) axons. Spatial segregation in the inner hair cell area could not be assessed; however, the peripheral axons in the osseous spiral lamina showed the same spontaneous rate(SR) -based organization reported for the cat (Kawase and Liberman [1992] J. Comp. Neurol. 319:312-318). Labeled central projections also showed significant spontaneous rate(SR) -based differences. Low- and medium- spontaneous rate(SR) fibers: 1) were more highly branched, 2) sent significantly more terminals to the small-cell cap region of the <BrainRegion>cochlear nucleus</BrainRegion>(CN) , and 3) produced endbulb terminals (on spherical cells) that were significantly more complex than high- spontaneous rate(SR) fibers. All of these spontaneous rate(SR) -based trends for both central and peripheral projections are analogous to those reported in the cat, and, thus, may represent a fundamental organizational principle of the mammalian ear.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Local-circuit neurones in the <BrainRegion>medial prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>areas 25</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>32</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>24b</BrainRegion>) in the rat: morphology and quantitative distribution.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>This paper is a light microscopical study describing the detailed morphology and quantitative distribution of local circuit neurones in <BrainRegion>areas 25</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>32</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>24b</BrainRegion> of the <BrainRegion>medial prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion> (mPFC) in the rat. <BrainRegion>Cortical</BrainRegion> interneurones were identified immunocytochemically by their expression of calretinin (CR), parvalbumin (PV), and calbindin D-28k (CB) immunoreactivity. Neurones immunoreactive for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) were also investigated, as were interneurones containing reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) diaphorase activity. Several distinct classes of calretinin(CR) +, parvalbumin(PV) +, and calbindin D-28k(CB) + neurones were identified; the most frequent were: bipolar/bitufted calretinin(CR) + cells in upper layer 3; multipolar parvalbumin(PV) + neurones in layers 3 and 5; and bitufted/multipolar calbindin D-28k(CB) + neurones in lower layer 3. calbindin D-28k(CB) + neurones resembling Martinotti and neurogliaform cells were also present in layers 5/6. The morphologies and depth distributions of each cell type were consistent across the three areas of <BrainRegion>medial prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion>(mPFC) studied. Seven classes of diaphorase-reactive <BrainRegion>medial prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion>(mPFC) neurone are described; these cells were composed about 0.8% of the total neurone population and had a peak distribution located in mid- to lower layer 5 in each area. In <BrainRegion>areas 32</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>25</BrainRegion>, three defined bands of diffuse nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate(NADPH) diaphorase staining were located in layer 2 and in upper and deep layer 5. Diaphorase reactivity was very infrequently colocalised with either calretinin(CR) , parvalbumin(PV) , or calbindin D-28k(CB) immunoreactivities. The numerical densities of neurones (N(V), number of cells per mm3) in each layer were calculated stereologically. The mean total neuronal N(V) estimate for <BrainRegion>areas 25</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>32</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>24b</BrainRegion> was 51,603 +/- 3,324 (mean +/- S.D.; n = 8). Significant interareal differences were detected. From <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> thickness data and neuronal N(V) estimates, the absolute number of neurones under 1 mm2 of <BrainRegion>cortical surface</BrainRegion> (N(C)) have been derived. The mean N(C) value for <BrainRegion>areas 25</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>32</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>24b</BrainRegion> was 57,328 +/- 7,505 neurones. In immunolabelled Nissl-stained sections, calretinin(CR) + neurones constituted an overall 4.0%, parvalbumin(PV) + cells 5.6%, and calbindin D-28k(CB) + 3.4% of the total neurone populations in <BrainRegion>medial prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion>(mPFC) . gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) + cells represented a mean of 16.2% (14.8-17.2%) of neurones in <BrainRegion>areas 25</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>32</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>24b</BrainRegion>. The absolute numbers of calretinin(CR) +, parvalbumin(PV) +, calbindin D-28k(CB) +, and gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) + neurones within individual layers in a column of <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion> under 1 mm2 of cortical surface (N(L)) have also been derived, with significant interareal differences in N(L) values being detected. The data provide the structural basis for a qualitative and quantitative definition of local cortical circuits in the rat <BrainRegion>medial prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion>(mPFC) .</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Identification of roughskin newt <BrainRegion>medullary</BrainRegion> vasotocin target neurons with a fluorescent vasotocin conjugate.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Arginine8 vasotocin (AVT), a neurohypophyseal peptide in nonmammalian vertebrates, plays a key role in the regulation of social behaviors related to reproduction. In male roughskin newts (Taricha granulosa), Arginine8 vasotocin(AVT) is an important facilitator of several reproductive behaviors, including courtship clasping of females. Although Arginine8 vasotocin(AVT) is known to act in certain brain regions and Arginine8 vasotocin(AVT) receptors have been localized to some extent, specific target neurons for this peptide have not been identified in any species. Internalization of a receptor-specific conjugate of Arginine8 vasotocin(AVT) and the fluorescent dye Oregon green was used to identify Arginine8 vasotocin(AVT) target cells in the <BrainRegion>medulla</BrainRegion> of male roughskin newts. Medullary neurons are of interest because they appear to mediate facilitation of clasping by Arginine8 vasotocin(AVT) . Direct application of Arginine8 vasotocin(AVT) -Oregon green to the fourth ventricular surface of the <BrainRegion>medulla</BrainRegion> in vivo resulted in conjugate internalization by a widespread population of <BrainRegion>medullary</BrainRegion> neurons, particularly in the <BrainRegion>medial reticular formation</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>nuclei of cranial nerves V, VII, VIII, IX, and X</BrainRegion>. Some <BrainRegion>fourth-ventricle</BrainRegion> ependymal cells were also labeled. <BrainRegion>Reticulospinal</BrainRegion> neurons, which play an important role in clasping, were identified by retrograde labeling with tetramethylrhodamine dextran amine. Arginine8 vasotocin(AVT) -Oregon green was internalized by 72% of these neurons. These results show that Arginine8 vasotocin(AVT) can directly affect a very large and diverse <BrainRegion>medullary</BrainRegion> neuronal population, which may underlie the peptide&apos;s role in multiple neuroendocrinological processes, including autonomic and behavioral regulation. Selectivity of the Arginine8 vasotocin(AVT) action may arise through interactions between Arginine8 vasotocin(AVT) and steroids such as corticosterone.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Changes in vesicular transporters for gamma-aminobutyric acid and glutamate reveal vulnerability and reorganization of <BrainRegion>hippocampal</BrainRegion> neurons following pilocarpine-induced seizures.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The reorganizations of the overall intrinsic glutamatergic and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic <BrainRegion>hippocampal</BrainRegion> networks as well as the time course of these reorganizations during development of pilocarpine-induced <BrainRegion>temporal lobe</BrainRegion> epilepsy were studied with in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry experiments for the vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGLUT1) and the vesicular gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) transporter (VGAT). These transporters are particularly interesting as specific markers for glutamatergic and gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) ergic neurons, respectively, whose expression levels could reflect the demand for synaptic transmission and their average activity. We report that 1) concomitantly with the loss of some subpopulations of vesicular GABA transporter(VGAT) -containing neurons, there was an up-regulation of vesicular GABA transporter(VGAT) synthesis in all remaining gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) neurons as early as 1 week after pilocarpine injection. This enhanced synthesis is characterized by marked increases in the relative amount of vesicular GABA transporter(VGAT) mRNAs in interneurons associated with increased intensity of axon terminal labeling for vesicular GABA transporter(VGAT) in all hippocampal layers. 2) There was a striking loss of mossy cells during the latent period, demonstrated by a long-term decrease of vesicular glutamate transporter 1(VGLUT1) mRNA-containing hilar neurons and associated loss of vesicular glutamate transporter 1(VGLUT1) -containing terminals in the dentate gyrus inner molecular layer. 3) There were aberrant vesicular glutamate transporter 1(VGLUT1) -containing terminals at the chronic stage resulting from axonal sprouting of granule and pyramidal cells. This is illustrated by a recovery of vesicular glutamate transporter 1(VGLUT1) immunoreactivity in the inner molecular layer and an increased vesicular glutamate transporter 1(VGLUT1) immunolabeling in the <BrainRegion>CA1</BrainRegion>-<BrainRegion>CA3</BrainRegion> dendritic layers. These data indicate that an increased activity of remaining gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) ergic interneurons occurs during the latent period, in parallel with the loss of vulnerable glutamatergic and gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) ergic neurons preceding the reorganization of glutamatergic networks.

<ArticleTitle>Organization of the afferent projections to the <BrainRegion>Wulst</BrainRegion> in the pigeon.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The afferent connections to the <BrainRegion>Wulst</BrainRegion>, a well-defined bulge in the <BrainRegion>forebrain</BrainRegion> roof, were studied in the pigeon. Cells of origin were identified by horseradish peroxidase retrograde tracing, after placing multiple injections in the <BrainRegion>Wulst</BrainRegion>. The results demonstrate a bilateral intratelencephalic pathway arising from the <BrainRegion>archistriatum intermedium</BrainRegion> (Ai) in the <BrainRegion>basal forebrain</BrainRegion>. Labeled cells in <BrainRegion>n. superficialis parvocellularis</BrainRegion> (SPC) and <BrainRegion>n. dorsolateralis posterior</BrainRegion> (DLP) on both sides of the brain, provide anatomical evidence for a <BrainRegion>bilateral forebrain</BrainRegion> projection of the <BrainRegion>somatosensory thalamus</BrainRegion>. A sparse ipsilateral input of unknown function from the <BrainRegion>medial thalamus</BrainRegion> originates in <BrainRegion>n. dorsomedialis anterior</BrainRegion> (DMA) and <BrainRegion>n. dorsolateralis medialis</BrainRegion> (DLM). We provide confirming evidence of the bilateral thalamofugal visual pathway ascending from <BrainRegion>nuclei of the dorsolateral thalamus</BrainRegion> (DLAmc and DLL). Projections from several <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion> structures are described, including: <BrainRegion>griseum centrale</BrainRegion> (GCt), <BrainRegion>medial and lateral reticular formation</BrainRegion> (FRM and FRL), <BrainRegion>area ventralis of Tsai</BrainRegion> (AVT), <BrainRegion>n. annularis</BrainRegion> (Anl), <BrainRegion>locus coeruleus</BrainRegion> (LoC), and the avian homologue of the <BrainRegion>raphe nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>n. linearis caudalis</BrainRegion> (LC). The account provides a direct anatomical demonstration of a <BrainRegion>Wulst</BrainRegion> input from the <BrainRegion>basal forebrain</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>somatosensory thalamus</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion>. The projection cells in the <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion> reside in structures known to contribute to ascending catecholaminergic and serotoninergic pathways.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>A histochemical study of the innervation of <BrainRegion>cerebral</BrainRegion> blood vessels in the turtle.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Specific histochemical techniques for the demonstration of noradrenaline and of acetylcholinesterase have been used to study the distribution of adrenergic and cholinergic nerves to the <BrainRegion>cerebral</BrainRegion> blood vessels of turtle, Geoclemys reevesii. The major and medium-sized <BrainRegion>cerebral</BrainRegion> arteries were supplied with dense adrenergic nerve plexuses, the plexuses were particularly dense in the medium-sized pial arteries of very thick vascular wall, indicating the functional significance of these arteries in the <BrainRegion>cerebral</BrainRegion> circulation. The parenchymal arterioles and capillaries were also supplied with adrenergic nerves. On the other hand, the cholinergic innervation was less dense than the adrenergic one and the acetylcholinesterase activity of the nerve fibres was remarkably weak. By contrast, the parenchymal small arterioles and capillaries exhibited heavy acetylcholinesterase activity on the vascular wall and, in addition, the capillaries were supplied with the well-stained acetylcholinesterase-positive nerve fibres. These fibres and also the adrenergic fibres associating with the capillaries appear to be of central origin. It is suggested that the cholinergic mechanisms in the parenchymal small vessels also play an important role in the <BrainRegion>cerebral</BrainRegion> circulation. The basophil leucocytes observed abundantly in the blood of turtle emitted an intensive greenish yellow fluorescence after formaldehyde gas-treatment.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Development of laminar organization in the <BrainRegion>mushroom bodies</BrainRegion> of the cockroach: Kenyon cell proliferation, outgrowth, and maturation.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The <BrainRegion>mushroom bodies</BrainRegion> of the insect brain are lobed integration centers made up of tens of thousands of parallel-projecting axons of intrinsic (Kenyon) cells. Most of the axons in the <BrainRegion>medial and vertical lobes</BrainRegion> of adult cockroach <BrainRegion>mushroom bodies</BrainRegion> derive from class I Kenyon cells and are organized into regular, alternating pairs (doublets) of pale and dark laminae. Organization of Kenyon cell axons into the adult pattern of laminae occurs gradually over the course of nymphal development. Newly hatched nymphs possess tiny <BrainRegion>mushroom bodies</BrainRegion> with lobes containing a posterior lamina of ingrowing axons, followed by a single doublet, which is flanked anteriorly by a gamma layer composed of class II Kenyon cells. Golgi impregnations show that throughout nymphal development, regardless of the number of doublets present, the most posterior lamina serves as the &quot;ingrowth lamina" for axons of newborn Kenyon cells. Axons of the ingrowth lamina are taurine- and synaptotagmin-immunonegative. They produce fine growth cone tipped filaments and long perpendicularly oriented collaterals along their length. The maturation of these Kenyon cells and the formation of a new lamina are marked by the loss of filaments and collaterals, as well as the onset of taurine and synaptotagmin expression. Class I Kenyon cells thus show plasticity in both morphology and transmitter expression during development. In a hemimetabolous insect such as the cockroach, juvenile stages are morphologically and behaviorally similar to the adult. The <BrainRegion>mushroom bodies</BrainRegion> of these insects must be functional from hatching onward, while thousands of new neurons are added to the existing structure. The observed developmental plasticity may serve as a mechanism by which extensive postembryonic development of the <BrainRegion>mushroom bodies</BrainRegion> can occur without disrupting function. This contrasts with the more evolutionarily derived holometabolous insects, such as the honey bee and the fruit fly, in which nervous system development is accomplished in a behaviorally simple larval stage and a quiescent pupal stage.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Ontogeny of 5-HT neurons in the <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion> of the lamprey, Petromyzon marinus.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>This study examined the spatial and temporal distribution of serotonin-immunoreactive (5-HT-ir) neurons in the <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion> of Petromyzon marinus at three developmental stages, larval, postmetamorphic, and reproductive. Computer-assisted 3-D reconstructions were made of the three main 5-HT-ir neuron groups. The rostralmost <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion> group was located near the <BrainRegion>posterior commissure</BrainRegion>, the second group at the isthmus, and the third group in the <BrainRegion>bulbar area</BrainRegion>. For each of those groups, the distribution of the 5-HT-ir neurons was very similar in the three developmental stages examined, suggesting that the 5-HT system is relatively mature early in larval animals. The soma of 5-HT-ir neurons increased in size and their dendritic fields increased in complexity with development. Furthermore, the number of 5-HT-ir neurons in each group increased significantly from the larval to the reproductive stage. To determine whether this was due to the genesis of 5-HT neurons, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) was injected into larval, metamorphosing, and postmetamorphic lampreys. These experiments revealed a few neurons colocalizing bromodeoxyuridine(BrdU) and 5-HT in metamorphosing animals. Taken together, the present results suggest that 5-HT neurons increase in number during maturation and that neurogenesis could, at least partially, contribute to the appearance of new 5-HT cells at different developmental stages.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Somatotopic organization of mechanosensory projections to <BrainRegion>SII cerebral neocortex</BrainRegion> in the raccoon (Procyon lotor).</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The pattern of projections of peripheral receptors to the <BrainRegion>neocortex</BrainRegion> in the <BrainRegion>second somesthetic receiving area</BrainRegion> (SII) was mapped in raccoons. The purpose was to determine if the projection area of peripheral receptors to the forepaw area in the <BrainRegion>somesthetic receiving area</BrainRegion>(SII) region is disproportionally enlarged as it is in <BrainRegion>SI</BrainRegion>. Tungsten microelectrode recording procedures were used to map thoroughly the <BrainRegion>inferior wall of the suprasylvian sulcus</BrainRegion> for regions responsive to mechanical stimulation of peripheral receptors. The results show that: 1. The forepaw area in <BrainRegion>somesthetic receiving area</BrainRegion>(SII) shows an enlargement commensurate with that found in the <BrainRegion>SI</BrainRegion>. This suggests that those factors that are selective for tactile acuity of the raccoon forepaw were operating in the evolution of <BrainRegion>somesthetic receiving area</BrainRegion>(SII) as they were in <BrainRegion>SI</BrainRegion>. 2. The somatotopic organization of mechanoreceptive projections to <BrainRegion>somesthetic receiving area</BrainRegion>(SII) is reversed mediolaterally compared to previous descriptions of this arrangement in other mammals: projections form axial structures lie medially and those from apical structures lie laterally along the inferior bank of the <BrainRegion>suprasylvian sulcus</BrainRegion> in the raccoon.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Development and distribution of substance P in the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> and ganglia of embryonic and newly hatched chick: an immunofluorescence study.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The development and distribution of substance P (SP) immunoreactivity were studied in the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> and ganglia of embryonic and newly hatched chick by using the indirect immunofluorescence method. Substance P immunoreactivity was first detected in the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> at embryonic stages 18-20 (incubation day 3). Before stage 32 (day 7), it was mainly found in regions corresponding to the <BrainRegion>dorsolateral funiculus</BrainRegion> and Lissauer&apos;s tract. Subsequently, substance P(SP) fibers appeared in the <BrainRegion>dorsal horn</BrainRegion>. By stage 38 (day 11), they were demonstrated almost throughout the gray matter, but mostly in laminae I and II. During this period, however, many substance P(SP) -positive cells were found just ventral to the <BrainRegion>central canal</BrainRegion> at the thoracic level, although a few were also detected in other areas throughout the cord. In the white matter, very dense longitudinal substance P(SP) fibers were observed in Lissauer&apos;s tract and the <BrainRegion>dorsolateral funiculus</BrainRegion>, where extremely dense plexuses of substance P(SP) immunoreactivity were also detected around a group of nonimmunoreactive cell bodies. At later stages, no remarkable differences were noticed in the distribution of substance P(SP) fibers, but the substance P(SP) -positive cells decreased gradually in number and disappeared after hatching. However, they reappeared following colchicine treatment. In the spinal ganglia, substance P(SP) immunoreactivity appeared initially at stage 25 (day 4). It was mostly located in small neurons of the mediodorsal region. These cells also decreased in number from later stages but increased by colchicine treatment after hatching. The development and distribution of substance P(SP) immunoreactivity in the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> and ganglia were generally comparable at all levels examined, except where indicated.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Internuclear neurons of the ocular motor system of the larval sea lamprey.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The internuclear neurons of the ocular motor system of lampreys are characterized here for the first time. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP), fluorescein-, or Texas red-(TRDA) coupled dextran-amine applied into the <BrainRegion>oculomotor nucleus</BrainRegion> of larval lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) retrogradely labeled two populations of <BrainRegion>contralateral abducens</BrainRegion> interneurons, one lateral and the other periventricular. Tracer application to the <BrainRegion>abducens nucleus</BrainRegion> anterogradely labeled thick contralateral fibers that specifically contact the <BrainRegion>medial rectus motor subnucleus</BrainRegion> by means of large boutons. Local application of TRDA to this subnucleus allowed identification of the <BrainRegion>lateral abducens</BrainRegion> interneurons as the origin of this projection. Electron microscopy of the <BrainRegion>medial rectus motor subnucleus</BrainRegion> showed large boutons bearing round synaptic vesicles that contact on the perikarya, as well as small boutons with pleomorphic vesicles. This <BrainRegion>lateral rectus (abducens)</BrainRegion> -- <BrainRegion>medial rectus (oculomotor)</BrainRegion> internuclear projection of lampreys appears to be similar to those involved in the coordination of horizontal eye movements in mammals. The <BrainRegion>periventricular abducens</BrainRegion> interneurons projected bilaterally to other <BrainRegion>oculomotor subnuclei</BrainRegion>. Tracer application to the <BrainRegion>abducens nucleus</BrainRegion> labeled a group of small interneurons in the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral dorsal rectus motor subnucleus</BrainRegion>. Anterograde labeling indicates that oculomotor interneurons project ipsilaterally to the <BrainRegion>ventral rectus abducens subnucleus</BrainRegion>, thus, corresponding to oculomotor interneurons found in mammals and frogs. The interneurons of the <BrainRegion>dorsal rectus and ventral rectus motor subnuclei</BrainRegion> are probably involved in the control of conjugate vertical eye movements. The present results strongly suggest that the internuclear coordination of conjugate eye movements appeared in the earliest vertebrates. The homologies of extraocular muscles of lampreys and gnathostomes were reexamined.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>The effect of <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> lesions upon visual discriminations in binocularly deprived cats.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Four cats were raised with binocular eyelid suture and, after their eyes were opened, were trained on a series of discrimination tasks. They performed at normal rates on the brightness task but indicated some difficulty with the pattern tasks. They then received large, <BrainRegion>bilateral occipito-temporal cortex</BrainRegion> ablations. Postoperatively, this in no observable way affected their visually guided orienting behavior, but it did destroy their capacity to perform the preoperatively learned pattern tasks. Postoperative performance on the brightness task remained good. These data indicate that, in these deprived cats, there is little or no <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> development for visual orienting, but <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion> is necessary for visual discrimination learning.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Cholecystokinin in <BrainRegion>hippocampal</BrainRegion> pathways.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The distribution of cholecystokininlike (CCK-L) immunoreactive cells and fibers in the rat <BrainRegion>hippocampal formation</BrainRegion> and its afferent and efferent connections was studied using the immunoperoxidase technique. In the <BrainRegion>hippocampal formation</BrainRegion> cholecystokininlike(CCK-L) immunoreactive perikarya were located in the polymorphic zone of the <BrainRegion>dentate hilus</BrainRegion>, all layers of <BrainRegion>Ammon&apos;s horn</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>subiculum</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>presubiculum</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>entorhinal cortex</BrainRegion>. Cholecystokininlike immunoreactive fibers extended from cell bodies or were located around the cell bodies in the <BrainRegion>entorhinal cortex</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>subiculum</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>stratum pyramidale of Ammon&apos;s horn</BrainRegion>, and among the granule cells and inner molecular layer of the <BrainRegion>dentate gyrus</BrainRegion>. The immunoreactive cells in the <BrainRegion>stratum oriens</BrainRegion> may be a type of basket cell, since processes from these cells extend into <BrainRegion>stratum pyramidale</BrainRegion> and collections of cholecystokininlike(CCK-L) immunoreactive fibers are seen around cell bodies in <BrainRegion>stratum pyramidale</BrainRegion>. Cholecystokininlike immunoreactive fibers were also observed in the <BrainRegion>alveus, ventral and lateral fimbria</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>ventrolateral lateral septal nucleus</BrainRegion>. Some of these immunoreactive fibers, therefore, being to either an efferent or afferent <BrainRegion>hippocampal</BrainRegion> pathway(s) originating from cholecystokininlike(CCK-L) immunoreactive pyramidal cells in the <BrainRegion>hippocampal formation</BrainRegion> and/or from the <BrainRegion>hippocampal subcortical nuclei</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>supramammillary nucleus</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus</BrainRegion> which contain cholecystokininlike(CCK-L) immunoreactive perikarya. The distribution of these immunoreactive fibers in the <BrainRegion>fimbria and lateral septal nucleus</BrainRegion> is most consistent with an anteriorly directed efferent <BrainRegion>hippocampal</BrainRegion> pathway.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Ultrastructure of hyaline, border, and vacuole cells in chick <BrainRegion>inner ear</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The sense organ for hearing in birds, the <BrainRegion>basilar papilla</BrainRegion>, is capable of replacing lost or damaged hair cells and supporting cells through regeneration. Potential candidates for precursor-cell populations include cells within the auditory receptor epithelium and nonsensory cells inferior to the sensory epithelium. Ultrastructural characteristics of hyaline cells, border cells, and vacuole cells, nonsensory cells which border or lie inferior to the receptor epithelium proper, were studied with transmission electron microscopy. Data were obtained from normal neonatal and adult chickens. Several rows of epithelial cells separate hyaline cells from inferiorly located organ supporting cells and hair cells. Ultrastructural characteristics and location of these epithelial cells differentiate them from organ supporting cells and hyaline cells; consequently, we have termed them &quot;border cells." Synaptic specializations are observed between neural elements and border cells, and gap junctions are found between adjacent border cells, between border cells and neighboring organ supporting cells, and between juxtaposed border and hyaline cells. Hyaline cells, in contrast to border cells, are highly specialized. Dense bundles of filaments are present in hyaline cells from the basal one-half of the papilla, and an unusual structure, a rough tubular aggregate, is present in hyaline-cell cytoplasm. Pre- and postsynaptic specializations are observed between neural elements and hyaline cells, and gap-junctional complexes link neighboring hyaline cells. Vacuole cells lie inferior to the hyaline cells and rest on the inferior fibrocartilaginous plate. They are unspecialized morphologically. Their only remarkable morphological feature is the abundance of spherical vacuoles within their cytoplasmic matrix.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Effects of undernutrition on myelination in rat <BrainRegion>corpus callosum</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Rats were undernourished by halving the mother&apos;s food intake from the sixth day of pregnancy onwards and through lactation. Subsequently, the young animals were maintained up to 48 days on half the normal diet. The effects of this regime of treatment on myelination in the <BrainRegion>corpus callosum</BrainRegion> were investigated by light and electron microscopy. In comparison with controls, the percentage of axons myelinated at 15, 21, and 48 days was reduced in undernourished rats. The number of lamellae constituting the myelin sheath was also reduced at 15 and 21 days, but at 48 days no difference was seen between control and treated rats, suggesting that a catch-up in myelination had occurred. A linear relationship between myelin sheath thickness and axonal diameter was observed in both groups of animals. However, a long-term effect on axonal growth was suggested by findings in the 48-day undernourished animals; in comparison with controls, axonal diameter was reduced, relative to myelin sheath thickness.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Localization of <BrainRegion>forebrain</BrainRegion> neurons which project directly to the <BrainRegion>medulla</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> of the rat by retrograde tracing with wheat germ agglutinin.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) in a slow-release polyacrylamide gel pellet was implanted in the <BrainRegion>medulla</BrainRegion> or <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> of the rat. Large numbers of retrogradely labeled cells were visualized by immunocytochemical procedures in specific <BrainRegion>nuclei of the forebrain</BrainRegion> mainly ipsilateral to the implant site following implants as far caudal as the <BrainRegion>sacral segments of the spinal cord</BrainRegion>. Total average number of labeled <BrainRegion>forebrain</BrainRegion> cells (three brains per category; 100 micron per 150 micron of brain tissue were examined microscopically): <BrainRegion>medulla</BrainRegion>, 2,115; cervical, 1,878; lumbar, 1,017; sacral, 385. After Wheat germ agglutinin(WGA) -gel implants in the <BrainRegion>medulla or cervical cord</BrainRegion> the majority of retrogradely labeled neurons were seen in the <BrainRegion>lateral hypothalamic area</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>zona incerta</BrainRegion>, and in <BrainRegion>subdivisions of the paraventricular nucleus</BrainRegion>. A continuum of labeled cells extended from the <BrainRegion>caudal part of the paraventricular nucleus</BrainRegion> into the <BrainRegion>posterior hypothalamus</BrainRegion> and into the <BrainRegion>central gray of the midbrain</BrainRegion>. Labeled cells were also seen in the <BrainRegion>medial basal hypothalamus</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>rostral part of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis</BrainRegion>. A few labeled cells were observed in the <BrainRegion>medial and lateral preoptic areas</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>rostral part of the paraventricular nucleus</BrainRegion>, and in the <BrainRegion>arcuate nucleus</BrainRegion>. Following Wheat germ agglutinin(WGA) -gel implants in the <BrainRegion>lumbar or sacral cord</BrainRegion> many retrogradely labeled cells were observed mainly in the <BrainRegion>paraventricular nucleus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>lateral hypothalamus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>zona incerta</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>medial basal hypothalamus</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>posterior hypothalamic area</BrainRegion>. The continuum of labeled cells described above was also seen following these implants. Our data indicate that the <BrainRegion>lateral hypothalamus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>zona incerta</BrainRegion>, as well as specific parts of the <BrainRegion>paraventricular nucleus</BrainRegion>, are major loci of neurons which project directly to the <BrainRegion>medulla</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> of the rat. The consistency with which labeled cells were localized across all brains examined within categories of implant sites and the large numbers of labeled cells counted within these areas appeared to verify the sensitivity of our retrograde tracing method. Therefore, we interpret the paucity or absence of labeled cells in particular brain regions to indicate that cells of these regions do not project to the <BrainRegion>medulla</BrainRegion> or <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Expression of L1 and TAG-1 in the corticospinal, <BrainRegion>callosal</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>hippocampal commissural</BrainRegion> neurons in the developing rat <BrainRegion>telencephalon</BrainRegion> as revealed by retrograde and in situ hybridization double labeling.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>In the <BrainRegion>telencephalon</BrainRegion>, the corticospinal (CS), <BrainRegion>callosal</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>hippocampal commissural</BrainRegion> neurons are the major types of neurons that have axons crossing the midline of the brain. To understand the mechanisms involved in crossing the midline structure and to examine whether the expression patterns of L1 and TAG-1 in the commissural neurons are similar to those in the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>, we investigated L1 and TAG-1 expression in these neurons in rats by using a double-labeling technique involving retrograde labeling and in situ hybridization. Expression of L1 messenger RNA was detected in the retrogradely labeled corticospinal(CS) projection neurons by 1,1;-dioctadecyl-3,3, 3;,3;-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI) injection into the <BrainRegion>pons</BrainRegion> at embryonic day (E) 19, but expression of TAG-1 messenger RNA was not detected in these neurons. Also, after their axons crossed the pyramidal decussation, continued expression of L1 but no expression of TAG-1 in the corticospinal(CS) projection neurons was shown by an additional double-labeling experiment involving DiI injection into the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> at postnatal day (P) 1. An immunohistochemical study showed that L1 was continuously present in each level of the corticospinal(CS) tract at E21 and P3, but TAG-1 immunoreactivity was not found in any level at any stage. Finally, we examined the expression of L1 and TAG-1 messenger RNAs in the <BrainRegion>callosal and hippocampal commissure</BrainRegion> neurons after their axons had crossed the midline by using the double-labeling technique. In both cases, hybridization signals of the L1 and TAG-1 messenger RNAs were observed in the retrogradely labeled neurons at P3. These results suggest that the roles of L1 and TAG-1 in the formation of the commissures in the <BrainRegion>forebrain</BrainRegion> are different from their roles in the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Fine structure of calcitonin gene-related peptide immunoreactive synaptic contacts in the <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion> of the rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Recent studies have shown a prominent calcitonin gene-related peptide immunoreactive (CGRP-ir) pathway extending from the <BrainRegion>external medial and external lateral para-brachial nuclei</BrainRegion> to the area surrounding and including the <BrainRegion>gustatory nuclei in the thalamus</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>amygdala</BrainRegion>. The function of the calcitonin gene-related peptide immunoreactive(CGRP-ir) pathway is not completely understood, but may be involved with the processing of both nociceptive and gustatory information in the <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion>. The purpose of this study was to characterize the nature of the calcitonin gene-related peptide immunoreactive(CGRP-ir) synaptic contacts in the <BrainRegion>gustatory nucleus</BrainRegion>. Electron microscopic examination of calcitonin gene-related peptide immunoreactive(CGRP-ir) synaptic contacts revealed two classes of calcitonin gene-related peptide immunoreactive(CGRP-ir) terminals. One class, which was large, formed asymmetric synaptic contacts on dendritic appendages, had many small, round synaptic vesicles, and heavy patches of reaction product which obscured any underlying organelles. Since similar terminals in unstained tissue contained large numbers of dense-cored vesicles, it was concluded that calcitonin gene-related peptide immunoreactive(CGRP-ir) was contained predominantly in dense-cored vesicles. A second class of calcitonin gene-related peptide immunoreactive(CGRP-ir) terminals was smaller and made either asymmetric or symmetric synaptic contacts. Both symmetric and asymmetric small terminals contained small, round synaptic vesicles and fewer patches of dense reaction product. Several of the calcitonin gene-related peptide immunoreactive(CGRP-ir) terminals making symmetric contacts also contained pleomorphic vesicles. There were very few contacts on cell bodies. There were no contacts on other calcitonin gene-related peptide immunoreactive(CGRP-ir) elements, somal or dendritic, or on axon terminals. None of the calcitonin gene-related peptide immunoreactive(CGRP-ir) terminal elements were postsynaptic to unlabeled terminals. Axons containing calcitonin gene-related peptide immunoreactive(CGRP-ir) were primarily unmyelinated, but a few myelinated axons were also seen.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Topography and synaptology of <BrainRegion>mamillary body</BrainRegion> projections to the <BrainRegion>mesencephalon</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>pons</BrainRegion> in the rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The anterograde and retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase conjugated to wheat germ agglutinin (WGA-HRP) was used to study the anatomical organization of descending projections from the <BrainRegion>mamillary body</BrainRegion> (MB) to the <BrainRegion>mesencephalon</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>pons</BrainRegion> at light and electron microscopic levels. Injections of WGA-HRP into the <BrainRegion>medial mamillary nucleus</BrainRegion> resulted in dense anterograde and retrograde labeling in the <BrainRegion>ventral tegmental nucleus</BrainRegion>, while injections in the <BrainRegion>lateral mamillary nucleus</BrainRegion> resulted in dense anterograde labeling in the <BrainRegion>dorsal tegmental nucleus pars dorsalis</BrainRegion> and dense anterograde and retrograde labeling in the <BrainRegion>pars ventralis of the dorsal tegmental nucleus</BrainRegion>. Anterogradely labeled fibers in the mamillotegmental tract diverged from the principal mamillary tract in an extensive dorsocaudally oriented swath of axons which extended to the <BrainRegion>dorsal and ventral tegmental nuclei</BrainRegion>, and numerous axons turned sharply ventrally and rostrally to terminate topographically in the <BrainRegion>dorsomedial nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis and rostromedial pontine nuclei</BrainRegion>. The anterograde labeling in these two <BrainRegion>precerebellar relay nuclei</BrainRegion> was distributed near the midline such that projections from the <BrainRegion>lateral mamillary nucleus</BrainRegion> terminated mainly dorsomedial to the terminal fields of projections from the <BrainRegion>medial mamillary nucleus</BrainRegion>. In the <BrainRegion>dorsal and ventral tegmental nuclei</BrainRegion>, labeled axon terminals contained round synaptic vesicles and formed asymmetric synaptic junctions primarily with small diameter dendrites and to a lesser extent with neuronal somata. A few labeled terminals contained pleomorphic vesicles and formed symmetric synaptic junctions with dendrites and neuronal somata. Labeled axon terminals were also frequently found in synaptic contact with retrogradely labeled dendrites and neuronal somata in the <BrainRegion>dorsal and ventral tegmental nuclei</BrainRegion>. These findings indicate that neurons in the <BrainRegion>dorsal and ventral tegmental nuclei</BrainRegion> are reciprocally connected with <BrainRegion>mamillary body</BrainRegion>(MB) projection neurons. In the <BrainRegion>nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis and medial pontine nuclei</BrainRegion>, labeled axon terminals contained round synaptic vesicles and formed asymmetric synaptic junctions primarily with small diameter dendrites. The present study demonstrates that projections from the <BrainRegion>medial and lateral nuclei of the mamillary body</BrainRegion>(MB) are topographically organized in the <BrainRegion>mesencephalon</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>pons</BrainRegion>. The synaptic morphology of mamillotegmental projections suggests that they may have excitatory influences primarily on the distal dendrites of neurons in these brain regions.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<AbstractText>To investigate the <BrainRegion>pallial</BrainRegion> organization and the exact location and extension of the <BrainRegion>ventral pallium</BrainRegion> in amphibians, we cloned a fragment of the homeobox XenopusTbr1 (xTbr1) gene and analyzed its expression compared with that of the genes xEomes (Tbr2) and xEmx1 in the <BrainRegion>telencephalon</BrainRegion> of the frog Xenopus laevis during embryonic and larval development. The expression of xEmx1 was also analyzed in the adult frog. We compared the expression patterns of these <BrainRegion>pallial</BrainRegion> marker genes with that of the <BrainRegion>subpallial</BrainRegion> gene xDistal-less-4 (xDll4). Our results indicate that the whole <BrainRegion>pallium</BrainRegion> of Xenopus expresses the T-box genes XenopusTbr1(xTbr1) and xEomes (in proliferating cells and/or mantle) during embryonic and larval development, and the expression of these genes is topographically complementary to that of xDistal-less-4(xDll4) in the <BrainRegion>subpallium</BrainRegion>. In addition to their massive expression in the <BrainRegion>pallium</BrainRegion>, both XenopusTbr1(xTbr1) and xEomes are expressed in a few dispersed cells in the <BrainRegion>subpallium</BrainRegion>, which may represent immigrant cells of <BrainRegion>pallial</BrainRegion> origin, because these genes are not found in the <BrainRegion>subpallial</BrainRegion> proliferating cells. On the other hand, during development xEmx1 is expressed in a large part of the <BrainRegion>pallium</BrainRegion> (proliferating and postmitotic cells) except for an area adjacent to the <BrainRegion>pallio-subpallial boundary</BrainRegion>, where xEmx1 is observed only in some mantle cells. This <BrainRegion>pallial area</BrainRegion> poor in xEmx1 expression and poor in expression of the <BrainRegion>subpallial</BrainRegion> gene xDistal-less-4(xDll4) , but expressing the pallial marker genes XenopusTbr1(xTbr1) and xEomes, appears to represent the amphibian <BrainRegion>ventral pallium</BrainRegion>, comparable to that described in other vertebrates (Puelles et al. [2000] J. Comp. Neurol. 424:409-438). In the adult frog, the <BrainRegion>ventral pallium</BrainRegion> appears to include the rostral part of the <BrainRegion>lateral amygdalar nucleus</BrainRegion> as well as a large part of the <BrainRegion>medial amygdalar nucleus</BrainRegion> (as defined by Marín et al. [1998] J. Comp. Neurol. 392:285-312). In contrast, the caudal part of the previously termed <BrainRegion>lateral amygdalar nucleus</BrainRegion> shows strong xEmx1 expression and may be a <BrainRegion>lateral pallial</BrainRegion> derivative. The possible homology of these amphibian <BrainRegion>amygdalar nuclei</BrainRegion> is discussed. Finally, expression of XenopusTbr1(xTbr1) , xEomes, and xEmx1 is observed in the mitral cell layer of the <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> from early developmental stages, further supporting that this structure is a <BrainRegion>pallial</BrainRegion> derivative.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Microscopic and biochemical characterization of lectin binding sites in the cephalopod <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Using light and electron microscope cytochemistry and lectin blotting techniques, we have shown that the lectins concanavalin A (Con A), Ricinus communis agglutinin (RCA), and peanut agglutinin (PNA) bind to specific glycoconjugants in the adult cephalopod <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>. For light microscope lectin cytochemistry, aldehyde-fixed, frozen, or Araldite-embedded, etched sections of cephalopod <BrainRegion>retinas</BrainRegion> were incubated with FITC- or TRITC-conjugated lectins and examined by using epifluorescence microscopy. concanavalin A(Con A) labeled structures in the entire <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> including the inner limiting membrane (ILM), rhabdomeric membranes, interphotoreceptor matrix (IPM), and structures in the photoreceptor inner segments. Ricinus communis agglutinin(RCA) labeling was similar to that of concanavalin A(Con A) except that there was a decrease in the staining of the rhabdom tips near the inner limiting membrane(ILM) . peanut agglutinin(PNA) labeled only the interphotoreceptor matrix between apposing rhabdomeres. The intensity of staining of the interphotoreceptor matrix(IPM) by peanut agglutinin(PNA) also decreased or was absent toward the rhabdom tips. None of the lectins labeled the myeloid bodies located in the photoreceptor inner segments. Electron microscope (EM) lectin cytochemistry was performed on aldehyde-fixed, LR White-embedded tissue or on Araldite-embedded, periodate-etched sections by using gold-conjugated lectins. Electron microscope(EM) results confirmed the observations made by light microscopy. Lectin blots with a <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> extract or light-sensitive membrane fraction revealed a variety of protein bands labeled by all three lectins. concanavalin A(Con A) and Ricinus communis agglutinin(RCA) labeled opsin and its aggregates whereas peanut agglutinin(PNA) did not. None of the lectins labeled retinochrome. The labeling of the cephalopod interphotoreceptor matrix(IPM) by peanut agglutinin(PNA) suggests a structural similarity between the interphotoreceptor matrix(IPM) of vertebrates and invertebrates. In other studies, we have demonstrated the presence of a retinoid binding protein in the interphotoreceptor matrix(IPM) of cephalopods.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Organization of the colliculo-suprageniculate pathway in the cat: a wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase study.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>A wheat germ-agglutinated horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) tracing technique was used to label the cell bodies of neurons in the <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion> that send projections into the visually sensitive region of the <BrainRegion>suprageniculate nucleus</BrainRegion> (Sg) in the feline <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion>. After determination of the position of the <BrainRegion>suprageniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(Sg) by detecting characteristic single-unit responses to moving visual stimuli, wheat germ-agglutinated horseradish peroxidase(WGA-HRP) was injected into the <BrainRegion>suprageniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(Sg) in five pentobarbital-anesthetized cats. The animals were than sacrificed, and serial frozen sections of the <BrainRegion>midbrain</BrainRegion> were processed for the demonstration of peroxidase activity. A total of 2,736 wheat germ-agglutinated horseradish peroxidase(WGA-HRP) -stained neurons were located within the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral superior colliculus</BrainRegion> (SC), and a few labeled cells were consistently found bilaterally in the <BrainRegion>external nuclei of the inferior colliculus</BrainRegion>. In each cat, a small but significant fraction of the labeled cells were encountered contralateral to the injection. <BrainRegion>Medial superior colliculus</BrainRegion>(SC) neurons tended to project to the <BrainRegion>posterior suprageniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(Sg) , and <BrainRegion>lateral superior colliculus</BrainRegion>(SC) neurons tended to project to more <BrainRegion>rostral suprageniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(Sg) . However, labeled cells were distributed homogeneously along the rostrocaudal extent of the <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion>(SC) , indicating the absence of a well defined topographic relationship. Nor was the <BrainRegion>suprageniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(Sg) injection site location related to the laminar distribution of <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion>(SC) projection neurons. In all cases, the majority of the labeled cells were found in layer IV (49.0%), with fewer cells in layers III (17.5%) layer V (20.0%), and layer VI (11.8%). No labeled cells were located in layer I, although a few were located in the deep part of layer II. Five types of <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion>(SC) projection cells were distinguished morphologically. Of the 258 labeled cells that could be characterized, 25% were stellate cells, 25% vertical cells, 20% granular cells, 17% triangular cells, and 12% horizontal cells. The average diameter of 226 cells ranged between 8 and 47 microns. We conclude that a mixed population of <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion>(SC) cells projects to the <BrainRegion>suprageniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(Sg) ; the morphological heterogeneity and the distribution of these cells suggests that several functionally different pathways may be involved in the colliculothalamic pathway and in the processing of visual input in the <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion>(SC) .</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Antibodies against <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> photoreceptor-specific proteins reveal axonal projections from the photosensory <BrainRegion>pineal organ</BrainRegion> in teleosts.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>With the aid of specific antisera to the <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> proteins S-antigen and alpha-transducin and to the rhodopsin apoprotein opsin, we have labeled various cell populations in the <BrainRegion>pineal organ</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>parapineal organ</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>habenular nucleus</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>subcommissural organ</BrainRegion> in two teleost species: the rainbow trout and the European minnow. Although these proteins are associated with photoreceptor functions, not only photoreceptor cells but also the majority of parenchymal cells in the <BrainRegion>pineal organ</BrainRegion> were immunoreactive. Immunoreactive cells with dendrite- and axonlike processes were observed also in the <BrainRegion>parapineal organ</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>habenular nucleus</BrainRegion>. Furthermore, S-antigen-immunoreactive, long, axonal processes were observed in the <BrainRegion>pineal organ</BrainRegion> and could be traced from the <BrainRegion>pineal organ</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>habenular nucleus</BrainRegion> and to the <BrainRegion>pretectal area</BrainRegion>. In the light of recent HRP electron microscopical and immunocytochemical studies we propose (1) that not only the classical <BrainRegion>pineal</BrainRegion> photoreceptor cells of poikilothermic vertebrates but also other types of CSF-contacting neurons may be the phylogenetic ancestors of mammalian pinealocytes, and (2) a close interrelationship between the <BrainRegion>pineal organ</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>limbic system</BrainRegion>, effectuated by the direct projections from <BrainRegion>pineal</BrainRegion> photoreceptors/CSF-contacting neurons/pinealocytes to the <BrainRegion>habenular nucleus</BrainRegion>, and by displaced &quot;pinealocytelike" elements scattered in the <BrainRegion>habenular nucleus</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Corticofugal projections to the <BrainRegion>vestibular nuclei</BrainRegion> in squirrel monkeys: further evidence of multiple <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> vestibular fields.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Single- and multiple-unit recordings were made from nerve cells located in the different nuclei of the <BrainRegion>brainstem vestibular nuclear complex</BrainRegion> (VNC) of anaesthetized squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus) by conventional stereotaxic techniques. After neurons responding to <BrainRegion>semicircular canal</BrainRegion> stimulation in a yaw, roll, or pitch direction or to otholith stimulation were identified, small amounts of retrograde tracer substances were deposited at the recording sites. Up to three different tracers were administered to different parts of the <BrainRegion>vestibular nuclear complex</BrainRegion>(VNC) in the same animal (Fast Blue, HRP-WGA, and Rhodamine-dextranes). After adequate survival times, the animals were sacrificed. Following histological processing, the <BrainRegion>cortical grey matter</BrainRegion> was screened systematically for cells labelled with the retrograde tracers (fluorescence microscopy or light microscopy for HRP processing). Labelled nerve cells which clearly project to the <BrainRegion>vestibular nuclear complex</BrainRegion>(VNC) directly were found predominantly in the cytoarchitectonic layer 5 of seven different <BrainRegion>cortical areas</BrainRegion>: 1) The <BrainRegion>parieto-insular vestibular cortex</BrainRegion> PIVC, which in squirrel monkeys consists mainly of the <BrainRegion>medial area Ri</BrainRegion> and parts of the <BrainRegion>anterior area Ig</BrainRegion>; 2) <BrainRegion>area 7ant</BrainRegion>, which presumably corresponds to the macaque <BrainRegion>area 2v</BrainRegion>; 3) <BrainRegion>area 3aV</BrainRegion>, a vestibular field of <BrainRegion>area 3a</BrainRegion>; 4) the <BrainRegion>temporal area T3</BrainRegion> bordering on <BrainRegion>area Ri</BrainRegion>; 5) the <BrainRegion>premotor area 6a; and 6</BrainRegion>, 7) the <BrainRegion>areas 6c and 23c of the anterior cingulate cortex</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>PIVC</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>area 7ant</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>area 3aV</BrainRegion> form the &quot;<BrainRegion>inner cortical vestibular circuit</BrainRegion>&quot; (Guldin et al.: J. Comp. Neurol. 326:375-401, '92), while the other <BrainRegion>cortical areas</BrainRegion> mentioned also have direct projections to the structures of the <BrainRegion>inner cortical vestibular circuit</BrainRegion>. It is speculated that the direct projections of the <BrainRegion>cortical vestibular structures</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>brainstem vestibular nuclei</BrainRegion> regulate the vestibulo-ocular, the vestibulo-spinal, and the optokinetic reflexes mediated through the <BrainRegion>vestibular nuclear complex</BrainRegion>(VNC) , thus preventing counteractions of these reflexes during voluntary, goal-directed head movements or locomotion.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Localization of sulfated glycoprotein-2/clusterin mRNA in the rat brain by in situ hybridization.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Sulfated glycoprotein-2 (SGP-2) gene expression seems to be constitutively expressed in a variety of tissues and organs, although levels of expression vary widely from one tissue to the other. Sulfated glycoprotein-2(SGP-2) , also known as clusterin, has been reported to be expressed in the central nervous system (CNS). Some possible roles for brain Sulfated glycoprotein-2(SGP-2) have been postulated. In order to provide a substrate for a better understanding of the functions of this glycoprotein in the central nervous system(CNS) , we investigated the detailed anatomical and cellular distribution of Sulfated glycoprotein-2(SGP-2) mRNA in the adult rat brain as well as the variation in its cellular expression after excitotoxin lesion. Transcripts for Sulfated glycoprotein-2(SGP-2) were found to be distributed throughout the rat central nervous system(CNS) , although regional differences in their prevalence were readily observed. The ependymal lining of the ventricles showed the highest level of expression followed by various gray matter areas, some of which contained very intensively labeled cells. These cells were mostly found among several <BrainRegion>hypothalamic and brainstem nuclei</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>habenular complex</BrainRegion>, as well as in the <BrainRegion>ventral horn of the spinal cord</BrainRegion>, which displayed striking hybridization signals over motoneurons. Occasional cells expressing high levels of Sulfated glycoprotein-2(SGP-2) transcripts were found in fiber tracts. Highly Sulfated glycoprotein-2(SGP-2) mRNA-positive resting glial cells were mainly located near the glial limitans and blood vessels. Two areas of relatively low constitutive Sulfated glycoprotein-2(SGP-2) mRNA expression are shown to produce strong hybridization signals 10 days after the local administration of the excitotoxin kainic acid. This overexpression of Sulfated glycoprotein-2(SGP-2) transcripts appears to involve GFAP-positive cells. Taken together, these results indicate that in the intact adult rat central nervous system(CNS) , various cell populations, including neurons, constitutively express Sulfated glycoprotein-2(SGP-2) transcripts, whereas in the injured brain, reactive astrocytes become the major producers.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Architecture of individual dendrites from intracellularly labeled thalamocortical projection neurons in the <BrainRegion>ventral posterolateral and ventral posteromedial nuclei</BrainRegion> of cat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>This study provides quantitative descriptions of individual dendrites from electrophysiologically characterized and intracellularly labeled thalamocortical projection (TCP) neurons of the cat <BrainRegion>ventrobasal complex</BrainRegion>. One hundred nine dendrites from six <BrainRegion>ventral posterolateral</BrainRegion> (VPL) neurons and six <BrainRegion>ventral posteromedial</BrainRegion> (VPM) neurons were examined. Measurement of several parameters showed that the individual dendrites were very similar to each other in overall architecture even though they varied greatly in total length and number of dendritic branches. The mean path distance (length from soma to a dendritic tip) was very similar for all dendrites in each group ( <BrainRegion>ventral posterolateral</BrainRegion>(VPL) or <BrainRegion>ventral posteromedial</BrainRegion>(VPM) ) regardless of the number of branches found along the path distance. However, <BrainRegion>ventral posterolateral</BrainRegion>(VPL) dendrites had a longer mean path distance ( <BrainRegion>ventral posterolateral</BrainRegion>(VPL) = 206 +/- 36 microns; n = 51) than <BrainRegion>ventral posteromedial</BrainRegion>(VPM) dendrites ( <BrainRegion>ventral posteromedial</BrainRegion>(VPM) = 182 +/- 29 microns; n = 58; P &amp;lt; 0.001). For all dendrites there was a strong correlation between the stem dendrite diameter and the dendritic length, which allows the estimation of dendritic length from dendrite diameter. Analysis of dendritic scaling shows that branches higher than first order do not follow Rall's 3/2 power rule, so these neurons cannot be modeled using the equivalent cylinder approximation. The data add to the qualitative descriptions of cat ventrobasal (VB) thalamocortical projection(TCP) dendrites currently available and provide a basis for future comparative, developmental, and plasticity studies. Analysis shows that many parameters of cat ventrobasal(VB) thalamocortical projection(TCP) dendrites fall within a narrow range, suggesting that, regardless of differences in length or superficial appearance, these dendrites share a stable underlying architecture.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Qualitative and quantitative analyses of the patterns of <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> input to neurons in the <BrainRegion>dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion> of the cat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>In the visual system of the cat the projection from the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion> has been studied extensively. However, the patterns of synaptic contacts made by individual axons onto individual cells have not been described. In this study these patterns have been examined for class 1 cells (Guillery: J Comp Neurol 128:21, &apos;66). <BrainRegion>Retinogeniculate</BrainRegion> axons and <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate</BrainRegion> neurons are labeled with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) via injections into the optic tracts and optic radiations, respectively. Sections are then processed for combined light and electron microscopic analysis. They are examined with the light microscope to identify labeled <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate</BrainRegion> neurons that appear to be contacted by labeled <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> axons. These cells and axons are then analyzed by a computerized microscope system, and sites of apparent synaptic contact are recorded. This light microscopic analysis indicates that individual class 1 cells are contacted by many <BrainRegion>retinogeniculate</BrainRegion> axons (&amp;gt; 10) and that each of these axons contacts many <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate</BrainRegion> neurons (&amp;gt; 20). Some axons make numerous contacts that are concentrated onto a few dendrites, while others make only a few contacts, which are spread over several dendrites. In all cases, the majority of contacts are on the dendritic shafts of relatively thick secondary and tertiary dendrites. Electron microscopic analysis confirms that most of the contacts identified with the light microscope are synaptic. It also reveals that labeled and unlabeled <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> axons can innervate the same dendritic segment. Finally, one cell was studied that had its soma and most of its dendrites in lamina A1 but some of its dendrites extended into lamina A. This cell received input from <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> axons in both layers, thus suggesting that it may have been binocularly excitable.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Sensory neuron number in neonatal and adult rats estimated by means of stereologic and profile-based methods.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Postnatal neuron addition, if it occurred, would have profound implications both for the conceptualization of developmental processes and for efforts directed at replacing neurons that were lost to injury or disease. Although dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) offer the advantages of clear boundaries and functional homogeneity, studies comparing neuron number in the DRGs of animals of different ages or sizes have yielded conflicting results. In the present study, neuron number in DRGs L3-L6 was compared in neonatal (approximately 11 days old, mean weight of 24.5 g, mean volume of 25 cm3) and adult (approximately 80 days old, mean weight of 373.5 g, mean volume of 346 cm3) male Sprague-Dawley rats. Estimates of neuron number were derived by using both stereological (physical disector) and profile-counting (one or more nucleoli within a nucleus) methods. The reliability and validity of the two methods were evaluated by comparing estimates of neuron number with those derived from three-dimensional reconstruction of a subset of neurons. The recommended protocol for using the physical disector was found to give accurate estimates of neuron number, but the heterogeneous distribution of neurons in the ganglion led to sampling errors of up to 50%. Reliability was improved by increasing the number of disector pairs examined. Counts of nuclear/nucleolar profiles were more reliable, but introduced a bias that worked against the experimental hypothesis in that estimates of neuron number in neonates exceeded actual values. Nonetheless, both methods indicated that adult rats had more DRG neurons than did neonates. Profile counts were 19% higher in adults (P &amp;lt; .01, two-tailed t-test); and data obtained by using the physical disector showed that adult rats had 28% more neurons than did neonates (P &lt; .05). The difference in neuron number between adults and neonates could be due either to neuron proliferation or to late differentiation of neurons that do not assume a typical appearance until adulthood.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Regional specialization of the rat <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>: catecholamine-containing amacrine cell characterization and distribution.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The distribution of catecholaminergic amacrine cells has been investigated in rats by means of immunohistochemical labelling of wholemounted <BrainRegion>retinas</BrainRegion>. Two groups of catecholamine-containing cells could be distinguished on the basis of their catecholamine and biosynthetic enzyme content. Both groups could be stained with an anti-tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) antiserum. The first group was composed of large, strongly anti-tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) -immunoreactive stellate amacrine cells, located principally in the innermost row of the inner nuclear layer (INL) and sending processes to the outermost sublamina of the inner plexiform layer (IPL). Some were displaced in the inner plexiform layer(IPL) or in the ganglion cell layer (GCL). This first group of cells can be regarded as dopaminergic since they were also stained by an anti-dopamine (DA) antiserum. The second group was composed of small, weakly anti-tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) -positive cell bodies, located slightly more sclerad within the inner nuclear layer(INL) . Their processes were usually not labelled with anti- anti-tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) . Identical cells could be better visualized with an anti-phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase (PNMT) antiserum. Their processes were observed in the middle sublamina of the inner plexiform layer(IPL) . A great number of these cells were displaced in the ganglion cell layer(GCL) . They could be regarded as epinephrine cells. Concerning the density and distribution throughout the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> a striking difference was observed between the superior and inferior halves of the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>, whereas a lower difference was observed between the nasal and temporal regions. Almost all the anti-phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase(PNMT) -immunoreactive cells were located throughout the <BrainRegion>upper retina</BrainRegion>, whereas the anti-dopamine(DA) -cells were especially concentrated in the upper temporal quadrant. The distribution of the anti-dopamine(DA) cells parallels that of the ganglion cells whose density is also maximal in the <BrainRegion>upper temporal retina</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Ultrastructural study on the <BrainRegion>meninx</BrainRegion> of the goldfish brain.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The <BrainRegion>cranial meninges</BrainRegion> of the goldfish were studied by means of transmission electron microscopy combined with the freeze-fracturing technique. The goldfish has three <BrainRegion>cranial meninges</BrainRegion>. The outer layer consists of flattened cells, which are stratified in 3 to 7 layers and are packed densely with many interdigitations of cell processes. The constituent cells in the outer layer have copious smooth endoplasmic reticulum and are joined by gap junctions but have no desmosomes. The intermediate layer is thin, continuous, and single cell. In the replicas, both the upper and the lower surfaces of the intermediate layer cells have numerous openings of pinocytotic vesicles, but the upper surface is characterized by round gap junctions, whereas the lower surface is identified by a linear continuation of a combination of tight junctions and gap junctions and by desmosomes. The lateral surface has a hexagonal network of tight junctions and gap junctions with internally located desmosomes, which functions as a barrier to intercellular movement of lanthanum. The inner layer consists of a meshwork of reticular cells and large intercellular spaces, in which fine granular material, capillaries, and different types of blood-derived free cells can be found. Cells in the inner layer contain rough endoplasmic reticulum stacked in lamellae and have irregular processes joined by desmosomes. The goldfish <BrainRegion>meninges</BrainRegion> are compared with the <BrainRegion>meninges</BrainRegion> of mammals.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Immunocytochemical expression of the blood-brain barrier glucose transporter (GLUT-1) in neural transplants and brain wounds.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The present study examined the immunocytochemical expression of the blood-brain barrier glucose transporter (GLUT-1) in a series of fetal <BrainRegion>neocortical</BrainRegion> transplants, autonomic tissue transplants, and stab wounds to the rat brain. GLUT-1 is one of a family of different glucose transporters and is found exclusively on barrier-type endothelial cells. In the brain it is responsible for the regulated facilitative diffusion of glucose across the blood-brain barrier. This investigation is the first to determine if this important molecule is altered during the process of angiogenesis that occurs following neural transplantation procedures or direct brain injury. Beginning in late fetal brain, e.g., E18 and continuing into maturity, GLUT-1 was strongly and exclusively expressed on normal <BrainRegion>cerebral</BrainRegion> vessels. In solid fetal central nervous system (CNS) transplants up to around 3 weeks postoperative, GLUT-1 was only weakly expressed, particularly as exemplified by colloidal gold immunostaining when compared with the host. At later times examined, up to 15 months postoperative, GLUT-1 immunoexpression was comparable with the normal adjacent brain. In autonomic tissue transplants, where the vessels do not have a blood-brain barrier, as expected, GLUT-1 was not expressed. In stab wounds, at 1 week there was extensive gliosis, and the injured vessels appeared fragmented and collapsed but still expressed GLUT-1, although to a somewhat lesser extent than normal brain. Between 3 and 6 weeks, GLUT-1 was expressed on tortuous vessels and in apparently fibrillar processes in the wound vicinity with a similar pattern to astrocyte (GFAP) reactivity. These results suggest the occurrence of a down-regulation of GLUT-1 in early transplants, perhaps related to reduced glycolytic activity or transient ischemia, or possibly due to the utilization of alternative energy sources. That GLUT-1 expression was not entirely lost in stab wounds to the mature brain suggests that the protein may be more labile in fetal or perinatal brain than in the adult and may not be affected by direct injury. Coupled with previous transplantation studies that have shown reduced neuronal glycolysis and potential barrier alterations, the reduction of GLUT-1 activity within nearly the identical time frame could indicate a relatively early critical period in cellular metabolism following transplantation of central nervous system(CNS) tissue.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Intrinsic <BrainRegion>choroidal</BrainRegion> neurons in the duck eye express galanin.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Recently, it has been shown that the <BrainRegion>choroid</BrainRegion> of the duck eye harbours approximately 1,000 intrinsic choroidal neurons positive for vasoactive intestinal polypeptide and neuronal nitric oxide synthase. Their connections and functional significance are largely unknown. This study was performed to establish a typical chemical code for these neurons and to define their targets by using immunocytochemistry and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Almost all intrinsic <BrainRegion>choroidal</BrainRegion> neurons coexpressed galanin (GAL), vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS)/NADPH-diaphorase. A few stained for galanin(GAL) and/or neuronal nitric oxide synthase(nNOS) only. Among extrinsic ganglia, galanin(GAL) / vasoactive intestinal polypeptide(VIP) / neuronal nitric oxide synthase(nNOS) coexpressing neurons were only found in the pterygopalatine ganglion where they accounted for approximately 30% of the neuronal population. Thus, galanin(GAL) / vasoactive intestinal polypeptide(VIP) / neuronal nitric oxide synthase(nNOS) -positive nerve fibres around branches of the ciliary artery and within the nonvascular smooth muscle stroma of the choroid may originate mainly from intrinsic neurons and to some extent in a subpopulation of pterygopalatine ganglionic neurons exhibiting the same chemical coding. Close contacts of galanin(GAL) -positive fibres upon intrinsic <BrainRegion>choroidal</BrainRegion> neurons may indicate reciprocal connections between them. Thus, intrinsic <BrainRegion>choroidal</BrainRegion> neurons may represent peripherally displaced pterygopalatine ganglion neurons forming a local network for regulation of vascular and nonvascular smooth muscle tone in the duck <BrainRegion>choroid</BrainRegion>. They may be integrated in the neuronal circuitry controlling intraocular pressure, <BrainRegion>choroidal</BrainRegion> thickness, accommodation, and axial bulbus length.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>An electron microscopical study of calcitonin gene-related peptide-like immunoreactive innervation of the <BrainRegion>anterior pituitary</BrainRegion> in the dog.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Our previous studies have demonstrated the presence of a considerable number of substance P-, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)-, and galanin-like immunoreactive (LI) nerve fibers in the <BrainRegion>anterior pituitary</BrainRegion> in several mammalian species. The present study investigated the ultrastructure of the calcitonin gene-related peptide(CGRP) - galanin-like immunoreactive(LI) innervation of this gland in the dog. The calcitonin gene-related peptide(CGRP) - galanin-like immunoreactive(LI) nerve fibers were unmyelinated, with a wealth of varicosities containing both small clear synaptic vesicles and large dense-cored vesicles. They were found to be in direct contact with every cell type of the <BrainRegion>anterior pituitary</BrainRegion>. However, only on corticotropes and somatotropes were calcitonin gene-related peptide(CGRP) - galanin-like immunoreactive(LI) synaptic contacts identified. Most of them were asymmetrical in type. Occasional symmetrical synaptic contacts were also found. It is considered likely that direct neural factors may play a role in the regulation of the <BrainRegion>anterior pituitary</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<AbstractText>Neurons in the rat <BrainRegion>nucleus tractus solitarius</BrainRegion> (NTS) possess morphologic characteristics that have been correlated with the type of synaptic information they receive. These features have been described for viscerosensory neurons but not for <BrainRegion>premotor nucleus tractus solitarius</BrainRegion>(NTS) neurons. The morphologic and synaptic features of neurons in the rat <BrainRegion>caudal nucleus tractus solitarius</BrainRegion>(NTS) were assessed using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings and biocytin labeling in <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion> slices. Gastric-related <BrainRegion>premotor nucleus tractus solitarius</BrainRegion>(NTS) neurons were identified for recording after inoculation of the stomach wall with a transneuronal retrograde viral label that reports enhanced green fluorescent protein. Three morphologic groups of <BrainRegion>nucleus tractus solitarius</BrainRegion>(NTS) neurons were identified based on quantitative aspects of soma area and proximal dendritic arborization, measures that were consistent across slice recordings. The most common type of cell (group I) had relatively small somata and one to three sparsely branching dendrites, whereas the other groups had larger somata and more than three dendrites, which branched predominantly close to (group II) or distant from (group III) the soma. Voltage-clamp recordings revealed spontaneous excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic currents in all neurons, regardless of morphology. Gastric-related <BrainRegion>premotor nucleus tractus solitarius</BrainRegion>(NTS) neurons composed two of the three morphologic types (i.e., groups I and II). Compared with unlabeled neurons, these cells were less likely to receive constant-latency synaptic input from the tractus solitarius. These results refute the hypothesis that general patterns of synaptic input to <BrainRegion>nucleus tractus solitarius</BrainRegion>(NTS) neurons depend on morphology. Gastric premotor neurons comprise a subset of <BrainRegion>nucleus tractus solitarius</BrainRegion>(NTS) morphologic types, the organization of the viscerosensory input to which has yet to be defined.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Purification and characterization of FMRFamidelike immunoreactive substances from the lobster nervous system: isolation and sequence analysis of two closely related peptides.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>In the preceding paper (Kobierski et al: J. Comp. Neurol. 266:1-15, &apos;87) FMRFamidelike immunoreactivity (FLI) was localized to specific cells and processes in the nervous system of the lobster Homarus americanus. In an effort to establish a role for this material we have purified and characterized a variety of immunoreactive peptides that can be extracted from the secretory pericardial organs. By using gel-filtration chromatography and three different HPLC systems, it has been established that little or no authentic FMRFamide is present. Of the major immunoreactive components two peptides were purified in sufficient quantity for microsequence analysis and have been tentatively identified as the octapeptides Ser-Asp-Arg-Asn-Phe-Leu-Arg-Phe-amide ( FMRFamidelike immunoreactivity(FLI) 3) and Thr-Asn-Arg-Asn-Phe-Leu-Arg-Phe-amide ( FMRFamidelike immunoreactivity(FLI) 4). Both of these are novel neuropeptides with some sequence homology to the previously described FMRFamide family. The pericardial organs release FMRFamidelike immunoreactivity(FLI) when depolarized with 100 mM K+ in the presence of calcium. Between 75 and 80% of this release is accounted for by FMRFamidelike immunoreactivity(FLI) 3 and FMRFamidelike immunoreactivity(FLI) 4. One of these peptides ( FMRFamidelike immunoreactivity(FLI) 4) has been synthesized and shown to cochromatograph with the endogenous immunoreactive material. Preliminary studies show that this peptide can act as a modulator of exoskeletal and cardiac neuromuscular junctions.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Peripheral and central aspects of the acoustic and lateral line system of a bottom dwelling catfish, Ancistrus sp.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The topographical relationship between the swim bladder, the <BrainRegion>inner ear</BrainRegion>, and the otic lateral line was studied in the bottom dwelling catfish, Ancistrus sp. In addition, afferent and efferent subcomponents of the eighth and lateral line nerves were labelled with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) or with differently fluorescing dextran amines. The swim bladder of Ancistrus consists of two separate, transversely oriented parts of each of which is connected to the <BrainRegion>sinus impar of the inner ears</BrainRegion> via two Weberian ossicles and the perilymphatic sac. The <BrainRegion>osseous capsula of the ear</BrainRegion> has two foramina other than the <BrainRegion>nerve foramina</BrainRegion>. One is for the <BrainRegion>sinus impar</BrainRegion>. The other foramen, which also separates two fluid-filled spaces, exits where the <BrainRegion>horizontal canal of the ear</BrainRegion> contacts the otic lateral line. Both the otic and the postotic lateral line canal run deep below the epidermis. Each canal contains a neuromast that is innervated by the middle lateral line nerve. Further caudally, the otic lateral line canal gives rise to the postotic and finally to the truck canal whose nonossified anterior part travels through an ossified chamber that surrounds the swim bladder. Thus the anterior part of each trunk lateral line canal is in contact with a bipartite sound pressure receiver, the swim bladder. Anterior and posterior lateral line afferents terminate ipsilaterally throughout the neuropil of the <BrainRegion>electroreceptive lateral line nucleus</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>mechanoreceptive nuclei medialis and caudalis</BrainRegion> of the <BrainRegion>medulla</BrainRegion>. Middle lateral line afferents terminate between the projection sites of anterior and posterior lateral line afferents. Some primary mechanosensory anterior lateral line nerve fibers continue into the ipsilateral eminentia granularis and the <BrainRegion>valvula cerebelli</BrainRegion>. In the electroreceptive lateral line projection, anterior lateral line fibers terminate more medially and posterior fibers more laterally. This somatotopy is not as clear-cut in the mechanosensory lateral line. Afferents of the <BrainRegion>sacculus</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>lagena</BrainRegion> terminate predominantly in the <BrainRegion>saccular nucleus</BrainRegion>. Afferents of the <BrainRegion>utriculus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>horizontal canal</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>anterior vertical canal</BrainRegion> terminate in the <BrainRegion>magnocellular vestibular nucleus</BrainRegion> and in the <BrainRegion>medial octavolateral nucleus</BrainRegion>. The projection sites of the anterior part and the posterior part of the <BrainRegion>eighth nerve</BrainRegion> show little overlap. <BrainRegion>Eighth nerve</BrainRegion> projections to the <BrainRegion>valvula cerebelli</BrainRegion> are less prominent than the projections from the lateral line. <BrainRegion>Eighth nerve</BrainRegion> and lateral line nerve efferents arise from a common nucleus, the <BrainRegion>octavolateralis efferent nucleus</BrainRegion>. Axons of efferent cells may divide to supply two or more branches of the <BrainRegion>eighth nerve</BrainRegion> and some axons supply both lateral line and <BrainRegion>eighth nerv</BrainRegion>e endorgans.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Cholecystokinin concentrations and peptide immunoreactivity in the intact and deafferented <BrainRegion>medullary dorsal horn</BrainRegion> of the rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>To further address the hypothesis that cholecystokinin (CCK) in the <BrainRegion>medullary dorsal horn</BrainRegion> (MDH) arises from intrinsic or higher-order neurons, cholecystokinin(CCK) -8-specific radioimmunoassay (RIA) and immunohistochemical (IHC) experiments were carried out in adult rats after <BrainRegion>trigeminal</BrainRegion> tractotomy. radioimmunoassay(RIA) of punches from deafferented superficial layers of the <BrainRegion>medullary dorsal horn</BrainRegion>(MDH) revealed no significant change in cholecystokinin(CCK) levels vs. the control right side. In this same area, immunohistochemical(IHC) revealed modest reductions in cholecystokinin(CCK) , gastrin, and substance P staining. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) staining was reduced substantially. Gastrin immunoreactive cell bodies, present normally in inner lamina II, were reduced in number. radioimmunoassay(RIA) and immunohistochemical(IHC) methods were also used to assess <BrainRegion>medullary dorsal horn</BrainRegion>(MDH) cholecystokinin(CCK) concentrations in adult rats subjected to <BrainRegion>left infraorbital nerve</BrainRegion> section at birth. The <BrainRegion>left medulla</BrainRegion> contained significantly higher levels of cholecystokinin(CCK) than the control <BrainRegion>right medulla</BrainRegion> (1.27 +/- 0.19 vs. 0.97 +/- 0.11 ng/mg protein). immunohistochemical(IHC) revealed a dense band of cholecystokinin(CCK) -like staining in laminae I and II ipsi- and contralateral to the lesion. Thus, neonatal deafferentation elevates <BrainRegion>medullary</BrainRegion> cholecystokinin(CCK) . To determine if the neonatal lesion-induced increase in <BrainRegion>medullary</BrainRegion> cholecystokinin(CCK) is due to primary afferent or higher-order reorganization, radioimmunoassay(RIA) and immunohistochemical(IHC) experiments were run after <BrainRegion>infraorbital nerve</BrainRegion> section at birth and trigeminal tractotomy in adulthood. radioimmunoassay(RIA) revealed no significant change in cholecystokinin(CCK) levels caudal to the tractotomy, although they were higher than control levels in 9 of 12 cases. immunohistochemical(IHC) revealed modest reductions in cholecystokinin(CCK) , substance P, and gastrin staining that resembled the reductions observed in tractotomy-alone cases. These data suggest that 1) most <BrainRegion>medullary dorsal horn</BrainRegion>(MDH) cholecystokinin(CCK) is of non-primary afferent origin, 2) gastrin immunoreactivity in layer II probably originates in cholecystokinin(CCK) -containing cells intrinsic to layer II, the expression of which is dependent upon <BrainRegion>trigeminal</BrainRegion> primary afferent input, 3) neonatal V deafferentation induces increased cholecystokinin(CCK) in the <BrainRegion>superficial medullary dorsal horn</BrainRegion>(MDH) , reflecting reorganized intrinsic or higher-order inputs, and 4) higher-order substance P in the <BrainRegion>medullary dorsal horn</BrainRegion>(MDH) is robust.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Location of motoneurones projecting to the cat distal forelimb. I. Deep radial <BrainRegion>motornuclei</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The position of the <BrainRegion>motornuclei</BrainRegion> projecting through the dorsal interosseus (DR) nerve to the distal forelimb muscles has been investigated in the cat. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and fluorescent (Fl) compounds have been used as retrograde tracers. They were either injected into forelimb muscles or applied to the proximal end of transected forelimb nerves. Limb muscles that were not investigated have been carefully denervated. Horseradish peroxidase(HRP) was used to trace the position and the architecture of the individual <BrainRegion>motornuclei</BrainRegion>. The topographical relations between the nuclei were established with application of up to three F compounds in the same animal. The position of the labeled <BrainRegion>motornuclei</BrainRegion> was reconstructed with a computer-assisted approach which is described in the appendix. The dorsal interosseus(DR) representation area extends from the caudal C5 to the caudal Th1 segments. In C6 it forms a dorsoventrally oriented narrow region at the lateral border of the <BrainRegion>ventral horn</BrainRegion>; in C7 and rostral C8 it forms a broad column in the <BrainRegion>dorsolateral corner of the ventral horn</BrainRegion>. In caudal C8 and Th1 this column is shifted into a ventral direction. The motoneurones projecting to the individual dorsal interosseus(DR) muscles are not randomly distributed in this area, but arranged in long, slender columns. These <BrainRegion>motornuclei</BrainRegion> occupy specific positions with only minimal interindividual variations. <BrainRegion>Three nuclei (brachioradialis, extensor carpi radialis, and supinator)</BrainRegion> are located in the C6 and C7 segments. They compose about one-third of the dorsal interosseus(DR) cell population. The nuclei to the other radial muscles are all located in C8 and Th1. Thus most of the dorsal interosseus(DR) motoneurones are located in these two segments. These results, together with those from the companion paper on the location of the <BrainRegion>median and ulnar motornuclei</BrainRegion>, provide important anatomical knowledge for the investigation of the cat brachial enlargement.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Ultrastructure and physiology of the hooded sensillum, a bimodal chemo-mechanosensillum of lobsters.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The antennules of decapod crustaceans are covered with thousands of chemosensilla that mediate odor discrimination and orientation behaviors. Most studies on chemoreception in decapods have focused on the prominent aesthetasc sensilla. However, previous behavioral studies on lobsters following selective sensillar ablation have revealed that input from nonaesthetasc antennular chemosensilla is sufficient for many odor-mediated behaviors. Our earlier examination of the setal types on the antennules of the Caribbean spiny lobster Panulirus argus revealed three types of nonaesthetasc chemosensilla. The most abundant and widely distributed of these is the hooded sensillum. The present study describes the detailed ultrastructure of antennular hooded sensilla and the physiological response properties of their receptor neurons. Light and scanning and transmission electron microscopy were used to examine structural characteristics, and electrophysiology was used to examine single-unit responses elicited by focal chemical and mechanical stimulation of antennular hooded sensilla. Hooded sensilla have a porous cuticle and are innervated by 9-10 chemosensory and 3 mechanosensory neurons whose dendrites project to the distal end of the sensillum. Hooded sensillar chemosensory neurons responded to waterborne chemicals, were responsive to only one of the six tested single compounds, and had different specificities. Hooded sensillar mechanosensory neurons were not spontaneously active. They had low sensitivity in that they responded to tactile but not waterborne vibrations, and they responded to sensillar deflection with phasic bursts of activity. These results support the idea that hooded sensilla are bimodal chemo-mechanosensilla and are receptors in an antennular chemosensory pathway that parallels the well-described aesthetasc chemosensory pathway.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Development of the geniculocortical pathway in rats.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Most cell of the <BrainRegion>dorsal laterial geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion> of rats are generated on fetal days 12 to 14. Their axons invade the <BrainRegion>telencephalon</BrainRegion> on fetal day 16 and run in the intermediate zone just below the <BrainRegion>cortical plate</BrainRegion>, reaching the visual area of fetal day 18. The axons do not invade the <BrainRegion>cortical plate</BrainRegion> significantly until close to birth (day 22 of gestation) and reach  their zone of terminal distribution between postnatal days 1 and 4. In subsequent days the projection becomes progressively more heavily distrubuted in layers IV and I, and synapses of <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> origin can be identified in these layers. While cells destined for layers IV cross the intermediate zone at the time that <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> axons first arrive, this coincidence of growth does not seem to be a factor which determines the specificity of patterns of thalamocortical connections since the cells reach layer IV several days before the axons. It is unclear why the axons should wait several days in the region immediately below the <BrainRegion>cortical plate</BrainRegion> before invading; although there is a parallel in previous studies on the development of the chick retinotectal pathway (Crossland et al., &apos;75).</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Neurogenesis of glutamic acid decarboxylase immunoreactive cells in the <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion> of the mouse. II: <BrainRegion>Area dentata</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The temporal patterns of neurogenesis of cells showing glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) immunoreactivity were determined in the <BrainRegion>area dentata</BrainRegion> of the mouse. Pregnant C57Bl mice received pulse injections of (3H)thymidine from E11 through E17 (E0 being the day of mating). The distribution of (3H)thymidine-labeled, glutamic acid decarboxylase(GAD) -positive neurons in the <BrainRegion>hilus</BrainRegion> and in the different <BrainRegion>strata of the fascia dentata</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>stratum infragranulosum</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>stratum granulosum</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>stratum moleculare</BrainRegion>) were recorded in adult animals. A radial gradient of neurogenesis of glutamic acid decarboxylase(GAD) -positive cells in the <BrainRegion>area dentata</BrainRegion> was not apparent. In the transverse axis, neurogenesis of glutamic acid decarboxylase(GAD) -positive cells seemed to follow a faint suprapyramidal to infrapyramidal gradient, which was due to differential timing of neurogenesis of glutamic acid decarboxylase(GAD) -positive cells destined for the <BrainRegion>stratum infragranulosum</BrainRegion> of the suprapyramidal and infrapyramidal blades of the <BrainRegion>fascia dentata</BrainRegion>. GABAergic neurons in the <BrainRegion>fascia dentata</BrainRegion> comprise a limited number of well-defined cell types. All of the different morphologic types of glutamic acid decarboxylase(GAD) -positive neurons present in the <BrainRegion>area dentata</BrainRegion> were generated prenatally. These diverse forms did not have specific times of neurogenesis. These results support the concept that the adult morphology of glutamic acid decarboxylase(GAD) -positive cells in the <BrainRegion>area dentata</BrainRegion> of the mouse do not bear any relationship to their times of origin.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Missplicing resulting from a short deletion in the reelin gene causes reeler-like neuronal disorders in the mutant shaking rat Kawasaki.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The shaking rat Kawasaki (SRK) is an autosomal recessive mutant that exhibits reeler-like abnormal locomotor behaviors. The murine reeler mutants arise from several mutations in the specific gene called reelin, which result in defects of Reelin expression or secretion in the <BrainRegion>cerebral cortex</BrainRegion> and other regions of CNS. To address the issue of whether the shaking rat Kawasaki(SRK) mutation also arises from a mutation in reelin, we analyzed the reelin gene in shaking rat Kawasaki(SRK) . Northern analysis of reelin mRNA from normal rats showed that rat reelin was expressed as a approximately 12-kb transcript in both the <BrainRegion>cerebrum</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>cerebellum</BrainRegion>, whereas reelin expression was markedly reduced in the shaking rat Kawasaki(SRK) brains. In situ hybridization analysis showed that reelin mRNA in the shaking rat Kawasaki(SRK) brains was expressed in Cajal-Retzius cells in the marginal zone of the <BrainRegion>cerebral cortex</BrainRegion> and outer granular cells in the <BrainRegion>cerebellar cortex</BrainRegion> in similar manners to normal controls, but its expression was considerably reduced. On Western blotting and immunohistochemical analyses using antibodies specific for the Reelin protein, no immunoproduct was recognized in the <BrainRegion>cerebral</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>cerebellar cortices</BrainRegion>. From the cDNA sequences, we found a 64-base heterologous sequence in shaking rat Kawasaki(SRK) reelin, which contains a termination codon in the reading frame. Furthermore, genomic DNA analysis revealed that a 10-base deletion, which contains a predicted splice donor site, occurred in the shaking rat Kawasaki(SRK) genomic reelin gene, resulting in &quot;read through" into the following intron in shaking rat Kawasaki(SRK) . Thus, the shaking rat Kawasaki(SRK) mutation is another type of mutation that lacks expression of the functional Reelin protein and, therefore, causes the reeler phenotype.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Anatomy of the adrenergic system in the <BrainRegion>medulla oblongata</BrainRegion> of the tree shrew: PNMT immunoreactive structures within the <BrainRegion>nucleus tractus solitarii</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The adrenergic system in the <BrainRegion>medulla oblongata</BrainRegion> of tree shrews was investigated by immunocytochemistry with an antibody against phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase. Two groups of adrenergic cells, which are equivalent to those of other species, were detected: Group C1 in the <BrainRegion>ventrolateral medulla</BrainRegion> and group C2 in the <BrainRegion>dorsomedial medulla</BrainRegion>. Adrenergic cells in C1 are located around the <BrainRegion>lateral reticular nucleus</BrainRegion> or between its subdivisions. They are mostly multipolar with branched processes. In group C2, some immunoreactive cell bodies smaller than those in C1 and many nerve terminals are found in the <BrainRegion>motor nucleus of the vagus</BrainRegion>, but most of the adrenergic cells and fibers are observed in the <BrainRegion>nucleus tractus solitarii</BrainRegion>. The cytoarchitecture of this nucleus resembles that described before for the rhesus monkey. In contrast to the rat, the <BrainRegion>subnucleus gelatinosus</BrainRegion>, which according to other authors receives cardiac and gastric afferents, is a prominent structure in immunocytochemically as well as conventionally stained sections. Adrenergic cell bodies and their fibers form a ring around this nucleus, but no immunoreactive structures are found within it. In the <BrainRegion>dorsomedial part of the nucleus tractus solitarii</BrainRegion>, adrenergic neurons are accumulated. They are often located in close proximity to blood vessels. Elongated immunoreactive neurons in the <BrainRegion>medial subdivision of the nucleus</BrainRegion> also seem to project in the direction of the dorsal area. Our data give new information about the adrenergic system in the <BrainRegion>medulla oblongata</BrainRegion>, especially in the <BrainRegion>nucleus tractus solitarii</BrainRegion> of the tree shrew, a species that provides a useful model of a small primate brain.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Organization of the <BrainRegion>superior olivary complex</BrainRegion> in the guinea pig: II. Patterns of projection from the <BrainRegion>periolivary nuclei</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>inferior colliculus</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The <BrainRegion>superior olivary complex</BrainRegion> is a major source of auditory projections to the <BrainRegion>inferior colliculus</BrainRegion>. Although the projections from the <BrainRegion>medial and lateral superior olivary nuclei</BrainRegion> have been well characterized, projections from the surrounding <BrainRegion>periolivary nuclei</BrainRegion> have received relatively little attention. In the guinea pig, cytoarchitectonic criteria can be used to distinguish 11 <BrainRegion>periolivary nuclei</BrainRegion> that can be divided into four groups. These are: 1) a lateral group that comprises the <BrainRegion>anterolateral and posteroventral periolivary nuclei</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>lateral nucleus of the trapezoid body</BrainRegion>; 2) a dorsal group that comprises the <BrainRegion>dorsal and dorsolateral periolivary nuclei;</BrainRegion> 3) a ventral group that comprises the <BrainRegion>rostral, ventromedial, and anteroventral periolivary nuclei</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>ventral nucleus of the trapezoid body</BrainRegion>; and 4) a medial group that comprises the <BrainRegion>superior paraolivary nucleus</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>medial nucleus of the trapezoid body</BrainRegion>. In the present study we used horseradish peroxidase and fluorescent tracers to identify <BrainRegion>olivocollicular</BrainRegion> cells in each of the <BrainRegion>periolivary nuclei</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>lateral, dorsal, and medial periolivary groups</BrainRegion> project bilaterally, and the <BrainRegion>ventral periolivary group</BrainRegion> projects ipsilaterally. Within groups, individual nuclei contain different numbers of <BrainRegion>olivocollicular</BrainRegion> cells. The <BrainRegion>posteroventral periolivary nucleus</BrainRegion> is the only <BrainRegion>periolivary nucleus</BrainRegion> that does not project to the <BrainRegion>inferior colliculus</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>superior paraolivary nucleus</BrainRegion> is the only <BrainRegion>periolivary nucleus</BrainRegion> that contains significant numbers of individual cells that project to both <BrainRegion>inferior colliculi</BrainRegion>. The remaining <BrainRegion>periolivary nuclei</BrainRegion> project only ipsilaterally or contain separate populations of cells that project to the two <BrainRegion>inferior colliculi</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Morphology of neuropeptide Y-immunoreactive neurons in the cat <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>olfactory peduncle</BrainRegion>: postnatal development and species comparison.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The distribution and morphology of Neuropeptide Y-immunoreactive (NPY-ir) neurons in the <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>olfactory peduncle</BrainRegion> was studied in the adult cat and rat, and the common marmoset Callithrix jacchus. Significant species differences were not observed. In all three species, the population of Neuropeptide Y-immunoreactive(NPY-ir) neurons is localized in the white matter extending from the <BrainRegion>main olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> to the border of the <BrainRegion>striatum</BrainRegion>. The neurons are characterized by a conspicuously looping axonal ramification pattern with some major collaterals running toward the <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> and others running toward the internal olfactory tract. The former, ipsilateral projection terminates in the granule cell layer of the <BrainRegion>main and accessory olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> and in layer II/III of the <BrainRegion>anterior olfactory nucleus</BrainRegion>. Reconstruction of the latter projection has revealed that the fibers are continuous with the <BrainRegion>olfactory limb of the anterior commissure</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>anterior commissure proper</BrainRegion> suggesting a commissural contralateral projection. The analysis of the postnatal development of the cat NPY neuron system supports this assumption in a very clear-cut way. In young animals growing fibers are observed to cross the brachium of the commissure. The NPY neuron system develops postnatally. The maximum cell number is reached during the third postnatal week. The appearance of more and more Neuropeptide Y-immunoreactive(NPY-ir) neurons slightly precedes the formation of the terminal fields and of the fiber projection in the internal olfactory tract. The density of this early fiber projection by far exceeds the fiber density observed in the adult. Later in development the fiber density in the <BrainRegion>olfactory limb</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>anterior commissure</BrainRegion> becomes considerably reduced. In contrast, the plexus density in the <BrainRegion>anterior olfactory nucleus</BrainRegion> and the granule cell layer of the <BrainRegion>main and accessory olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> undergoes only a slight reduction, and the Neuropeptide Y-immunoreactive(NPY-ir) cell number remains roughly constant. These observations suggest that the ipsilateral Neuropeptide Y-immunoreactive(NPY-ir) projection remains largely unchanged, in contrast to the contralateral projection, which exists to a large extent only for the first four postnatal months. The observation that the NPY neuron system gives rise to a contralateral projection does not support a classification of NPY neurons as short axon cells.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Deafferentation induces novel axonal projections in the <BrainRegion>auditory brainstem</BrainRegion> after hearing onset.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Deafferentation of neural tissue can result in cell death, morphological changes, and/or alterations in sources of innervation. These changes often occur during a limited period of development. In the <BrainRegion>auditory brainstem</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>ventral cochlear nucleus</BrainRegion> (VCN) projects to the contralateral but not ipsilateral <BrainRegion>medial nucleus of the trapezoid body</BrainRegion> (MNTB). This pathway is part of a circuit that computes interaural intensity differences used in sound localization. Previous studies have shown that, after the <BrainRegion>cochlea</BrainRegion> is removed early in postnatal development, cells in the <BrainRegion>ventral cochlear nucleus</BrainRegion>(VCN) on the deafferented side die, and the intact <BrainRegion>ventral cochlear nucleus</BrainRegion>(VCN) innervates <BrainRegion>medial nucleus of the trapezoid body</BrainRegion>(MNTB) on both sides of the brain. These changes after <BrainRegion>cochlea</BrainRegion> removal are limited to an early postnatal period that preceeds hearing onset. In this study, we lesioned the <BrainRegion>ventral cochlear nucleus</BrainRegion>(VCN) directly to evaluate plasticity in axonal pathways after hearing onset. We found that novel projections from the intact <BrainRegion>ventral cochlear nucleus</BrainRegion>(VCN) to <BrainRegion>ipsilateral medial nucleus of the trapezoid body</BrainRegion>(MNTB) emerge after lesions performed as late as postnatal day 25. The morphological sequence of events is similar to that seen during the initial development of this pathway. These data suggest that plasticity in the <BrainRegion>auditory brainstem</BrainRegion> is possible when pathways are challenged with denervation of target nuclei. The results show that the opportunity for plasticity in <BrainRegion>auditory brainstem</BrainRegion> circuitry is more prolonged than previously thought and that novel pathways can form after the normal pathways are fully mature and functional. Moreover, sensitive periods for changes in individual pathways are independently regulated.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>The development of the <BrainRegion>cerebellar cortex</BrainRegion> of the Syrian hamster, Mesocricetus auratus. Foliation, cytoarchitectonic, Golgi, and electron microscopic studies.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Although a number of investigations of abnormalities of <BrainRegion>cerebellar</BrainRegion> development have been carried out in the hamster, no detailed Golgi or ultrastructural studies of <BrainRegion>cerebellar</BrainRegion> development in this species have been reported. This report describes the development of the hamster <BrainRegion>cerebellar cortex</BrainRegion> from birth (day 0) through postnatal day 78, as studied by light, Golgi, and electron microscopic methods. Foliation patterns correlate with the expansion of the <BrainRegion>cerebellar</BrainRegion> layers and of total <BrainRegion>cerebellar area</BrainRegion>. Cytologic and morphologic development of the major <BrainRegion>cerebellar</BrainRegion> cell types--Purkinje, Golgi, basket, stellate, granule, and Bergmann glial cells--correlate with those of other species, such as the rat and mouse. Electron microscopic observations at selected developmental ages allow identification and classification of synapses in the early postnatal hamster. Parallel fiber and climbing fiber synapses are already present at birth. Although synaptogenesis probably continues through the first two postnatal months, all major cell types have developed initial synapses by postnatal day 6, at a time when little cellular maturation has occurred. By using gestational rather than natal age, close developmental correlations between hamsters and rat and mouse are possible. Since the gestational period of the hamster is only 16 days, the hamster <BrainRegion>cerebellum</BrainRegion> is less mature at birth than that of either the rat or mouse. Thus, the hamster is a convenient animal in which to investigate the effects of various procedures on early <BrainRegion>cerebellar</BrainRegion> development.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Topographical organization of projections from the <BrainRegion>subiculum</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion> in the rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The projections from the <BrainRegion>subiculum</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion> were comprehensively examined in the rat by using the anterograde Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) and retrograde cholera toxin B subunit (CTb) methods. Tracing of efferents with Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin(PHA-L) indicated that the <BrainRegion>medial preoptic region</BrainRegion> received projection fibers from the <BrainRegion>temporal two-thirds of the subiculum</BrainRegion>, whereas the <BrainRegion>anterior, tuberal, and mammillary regions</BrainRegion> received those from the <BrainRegion>full longitudinal extent of the subiculum</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>subicular</BrainRegion> projections to the <BrainRegion>anterior and tuberal hypothalamic regions</BrainRegion> were also found to be organized in a topographical manner such that the temporal-to-septal axis of origin in the <BrainRegion>subiculum</BrainRegion> determined a ventromedial-to-dorsolateral axis of termination in the <BrainRegion>medial zone of the hypothalamus</BrainRegion>: Massive labeled fibers from the <BrainRegion>temporalmost part of the subiculum</BrainRegion> terminated in the <BrainRegion>subparaventricular zone</BrainRegion> and its <BrainRegion>caudal continuum</BrainRegion> around the <BrainRegion>dorsal and medial aspects of the ventromedial nucleus</BrainRegion>, and those from progressively more septal parts terminated in progressively more <BrainRegion>dorsolateral parts of the medial zone</BrainRegion>. In addition, the temporal-to-septal axis of origin in the <BrainRegion>subiculum</BrainRegion> tended to determine a medial-to-lateral axis of termination in the <BrainRegion>preoptic region</BrainRegion> as well as a ventral-to-dorsal axis of termination in the <BrainRegion>mammillary region</BrainRegion>. Furthermore, the temporal-to-septal axis of origin in the <BrainRegion>septal two-thirds of the subiculum</BrainRegion> corresponded to a ventrolateral-to-dorsomedial axis of termination in the <BrainRegion>medial mammillary nucleus</BrainRegion>. The topographical projections from the <BrainRegion>subiculum</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>medial zone of the hypothalamus</BrainRegion> were confirmed by cholera toxin B subunit(CTb) experiments, representatively in the <BrainRegion>subicular</BrainRegion> projections to the <BrainRegion>anterior hypothalamic region</BrainRegion>. These results suggest that different populations of neurons existing along the longitudinal axis of the <BrainRegion>subiculum</BrainRegion> may exert their influences on the execution of different <BrainRegion>hypothalamic</BrainRegion> functions.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Synaptic organization of cholinergic amacrine cells in the rhesus monkey <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>In the rhesus monkey <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>, choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) immunoreactivity has been used to study the localization and synaptic organization of cholinergic neurons by both light and electron microscopy with peroxidase-antiperoxidase immunohistochemistry. choline acetyltransferase(ChAT) -containing neurons are a type of amacrine cell with 97.5% of their cell bodies localized to the ganglion cell layer and the remainder in the inner nuclear layer. Their processes arborize in a single narrow band in the inner plexiform layer in a plane dividing the outer two-thirds from the inner one-third of this synaptic region. With electron microscopy, choline acetyltransferase(ChAT) -immunoreactive amacrine cell processes were observed to be primarily postsynaptic to the diffuse invaginating cone bipolar cells and presynaptic to ganglion cells, although they are both post- and presynaptic to immunohistochemically unlabeled amacrine cell profiles and to choline acetyltransferase(ChAT) -containing amacrine cell processes as well.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Merkel cells are responsible for the initiation of taste organ morphogenesis in the frog.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Taste organs in the frog have a distinctive cell type located exclusively in the basal portion. In the same fashion as type III cells in mammalian taste buds, these basal cells show immunoreactivity for serotonin antibody. Further, these cells are morphologically similar to epidermal Merkel cells. To determine the significance of these serotonergic basal cells, we examined the early development of taste organs during metamorphosis of the frog by focusing on the origin and possible roles of serotonergic basal cells. For convenience of description, five stages of development (metamorphic stage to climax stages A-D) are defined. In the metamorphic stage, a few noninnervated Merkel cells appear at the upper layer of the lingual epithelium. No neuronal elements are seen in the epithelium at this stage. At climax stages A-B, immature fungiform papillae become discernible in the dorsal surface of the tongue, where the Merkel cells are located. Merkel cells then move downward and extend their cytoplasmic processes toward the basal lamina. These cells are identified by their intense immunoreactivity for serotonin. During the later stages, many nerve fibers in the subepithelial connective tissue approach the epithelium containing Merkel cells. At climax stages C-D, Merkel cells extend cytoplasmic processes along the basal lamina toward the center of the newly forming fungiform papillae. The morphology of these Merkel cells exactly coincides with that of serotonergic basal cells in adult taste organs. Profuse exocytotic release of dense-cored granules of Merkel cells toward the nerve fibers through the basal lamina is frequently seen in these stages. The present study indicates that serotonergic basal cells are derived from intraepithelial Merkel cells, which act as target sites for growing nerves and may be responsible for the initiation of taste organ morphogenesis.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>The <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> projections of the <BrainRegion>mediodorsal nucleus</BrainRegion> and adjacent <BrainRegion>thalamic nuclei</BrainRegion> in the rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The <BrainRegion>mediodorsal nucleus</BrainRegion> of the <BrainRegion>rat thalamus</BrainRegion> has been divided into medial, central and lateral segments on the basis of its structure and axonal connections, and these segments have been shown by experiments using the autoradiographic method of demonstrating axonal connections to project to seven distinct <BrainRegion>cortical areas</BrainRegion> covering most of the frontal pole of the hemisphere. The position and cytoarchitectonic characteristics of these areas are described. The <BrainRegion>medial segment of the nucleus</BrainRegion> projects to the <BrainRegion>prelimbic area</BrainRegion> (32) on the medial surface of the hemisphere, and to the <BrainRegion>dorsal agranular insular area</BrainRegion>, dorsal to the <BrainRegion>rhinal sulcus</BrainRegion> on the lateral surface. The <BrainRegion>lateral segment</BrainRegion> projects to the <BrainRegion>anterior cingulate area</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>area 24</BrainRegion>) and the <BrainRegion>medial precentral area</BrainRegion> on the dorsomedial shoulder of the hemisphere, while the <BrainRegion>central segment</BrainRegion> projects to the <BrainRegion>ventral agranular insular area</BrainRegion> in the <BrainRegion>dorsal bank of the rhinal sulcus</BrainRegion>, and to a <BrainRegion>lateral part of the orbital cortex</BrainRegion> further rostrally. (The term &quot;orbital" is used to refer to the <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion> on the ventral surface of the frontal pole of the hemisphere.) A ventral part of this <BrainRegion>orbital cortex</BrainRegion> also receives fibers from the <BrainRegion>mediodorsal nucleus</BrainRegion>, possibly its lateral segment, but the <BrainRegion>medial part of the orbital cortex</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>ventrolateral orbital area in the fundus of the rhinal sulcus</BrainRegion> receive projections from the <BrainRegion>paratenial nucleus</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>submedial nucleus</BrainRegion>, respectively. All of these thalamocortical projections end in layer III, and in the outer part of layer I. The <BrainRegion>basal nucleus of the ventromedial complex</BrainRegion> (the <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> taste relay) has been shown to have a similar laminar projection (layer I and layers III/IV) to the <BrainRegion>granular insular area</BrainRegion> immediately dorsal to, but not overlapping, the <BrainRegion>mediodorsal projection field</BrainRegion>. However, the <BrainRegion>principal nucleus of the ventromedial complex</BrainRegion> appears to project to layer I, and possibly layer VI, of the entire frontal pole of the hemisphere. The <BrainRegion>anteromedial nucleus</BrainRegion> does not appear to project to layer III of the projection field of the <BrainRegion>mediodorsal nucleus</BrainRegion>, although it may project to layers I and VI, especially in the <BrainRegion>anterior cingulate</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>medial precentral areas</BrainRegion>. A <BrainRegion>thalamoamygdaloid</BrainRegion> projection from the <BrainRegion>medial segment of the mediodorsal nucleus</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>basolateral nucleus of the amygdala</BrainRegion> has also been demonstrated, which reciprocates an amygdalothalamic projection from the <BrainRegion>basolateral nucleus</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>medial segment</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>habenular nuclei</BrainRegion> also appear to project to the <BrainRegion>central nucleus of the amygdala</BrainRegion>. These results are discussed in relation to the delineation and subdivision of the <BrainRegion>prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion> in the rat, and to amygdalothalamic and amygdalocortical projections which are described in a subsequent paper (Krettek and Price, &apos;77).</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Representation of the body surface in the <BrainRegion>gracile, cuneate, and spinal trigeminal nuclei</BrainRegion> of the little red flying fox (Pteropus scapulatus).</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The body surface representation in the <BrainRegion>gracile, cuneate, and spinal trigeminal nuclei</BrainRegion> of the little red flying fox (Pteropus scapulatus) was examined. As in other species, it was found that any single cross-section through all three nuclei contains a representation of most, or all, of the body surface. In the little red flying fox, however, this representation is arranged as a series of dorsolateral to ventromedially oriented bands, within which there are no apparent topographies. These bands are arranged in such a way that the spatial relationships between body regions in the representation do not reflect those at the periphery.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Generation and death of cells in the <BrainRegion>dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion> of the wallaby, Setonix brachyurus (quokka).</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>To study postnatal cell generation in primary visual centres of the quokka, tritiated thymidine was injected into pouch-young aged postnatal day (P)1-P85. Brains were examined at P100, just before eye-opening, when primary visual projections are essentially mature. Neurons in the <BrainRegion>dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion> (dLGN) and <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion> (SC) were generated at P1-P10 and P1-P18 respectively. Peak numbers of labelled cells were seen at P3 and P5 in the <BrainRegion>dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(dLGN) and <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion>(SC) . Cell death was assessed in the <BrainRegion>dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(dLGN) and <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion>(SC) of young aged P10-P150. Low numbers of dying cells were seen in the <BrainRegion>dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(dLGN) throughout this period, with a small peak at P85. A more substantial peak of cell death was seen in the <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion>(SC) , also at P85. In the quokka, the time interval between the peaks of cell generation and of cell death in the <BrainRegion>dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(dLGN) and <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion>(SC) is 70-80 days, considerably longer than the interval of 40 days between birth and death of <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> cells.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Disruption of the <BrainRegion>retinal basal lamina</BrainRegion> during early embryonic development leads to a retraction of vitreal end feet, an increased number of ganglion cells, and aberrant axonal outgrowth.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Bacterial collagenase was injected into the vitreous of the eye of chick and quail embryos. Immunocytochemical and ultrastructural studies revealed that the collagenase dissolved the <BrainRegion>retinal basal lamina</BrainRegion> of the injected eye. The basal lamina disruption was first detectable 1 hour after enzyme injection and was complete within 3 hours. With further development, the <BrainRegion>retinal basal lamina</BrainRegion> was not reestablished; newly developing neuroepithelium in the <BrainRegion>peripheral retina</BrainRegion>, however, generated an intact basal lamina. Western blot analysis showed that Clostridial collagenase degraded various collagens but spared noncollagenous proteins. Basal lamina disruption of embryonic day 3 to 6 retinae led to the retraction of the end feet of the neuroepithelial cells, caused an increase in the number of Islet-1+ cells (most likely ganglion cells), an increase in the thickness of the optic fiber layer, and aberrant growth of optic axons on their way toward the <BrainRegion>optic disc</BrainRegion>. None of these changes were observed when <BrainRegion>retinal basal laminae</BrainRegion> were disrupted at later stages of development. The present data demonstrate that the <BrainRegion>retinal basal lamina</BrainRegion>, by anchoring the neuroepithelial cells to the pial surface of the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>, has an important function in the development of the normal cytoarchitecture of this structure. It is proposed that the altered extracellular environment in the vitreal part of the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>, resulting in the retraction of the neuroepithelial end feet, is responsible for the increased number of Islet-1+ cells and the aberrant axonal navigation.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Characterization of dopaminergic <BrainRegion>midbrain</BrainRegion> neurons in a DBH:BDNF transgenic mouse.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been implicated in the survival and differentiation of central nervous system neurons, including dopaminergic cells in culture. To determine whether brain-derived neurotrophic factor(BDNF) might play a role in the development of dopaminergic neurons in vivo, we used a previously characterized transgenic mouse (DBH: brain-derived neurotrophic factor(BDNF) ) that overexpresses brain-derived neurotrophic factor(BDNF) in adrenergic and noradrenergic neurons as a result of fusion of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor(BDNF) gene to the dopamine beta-hydroxylase ( dopamine beta-hydroxylase(DBH) ) gene promoter. We quantified dopaminergic neuronal profiles at four <BrainRegion>midbrain</BrainRegion> coronal levels and compared dopamine beta-hydroxylase(DBH) : brain-derived neurotrophic factor(BDNF) transgenic animals with wild-type mice of the same genetic background. Analysis of sections immunostained with tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) showed that the mean number of dopaminergic neurons in the four selected <BrainRegion>midbrain</BrainRegion> sections was 52% greater (one-way analysis of variance, P &amp;lt; 0.0005) in transgenic mice (2,165 +/- 55 S. E.M., n = 4) than in control mice (1,428 +/- 71 S.E.M., n = 4). The increase in dopaminergic neuron profile count in dopamine beta-hydroxylase(DBH) : brain-derived neurotrophic factor(BDNF) transgenic animals was confirmed by analysis of the <BrainRegion>pars compacta of the substantia nigra</BrainRegion> on Nissl-stained sections. Surface area of the reference region of interest containing tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) -immunoreactive neurons was similar in transgenic and control mice. Regional analysis of different midbrain <BrainRegion>areas</BrainRegion> containing dopaminergic neurons suggested that the increase in cell profile count occurs in a relatively homogeneous manner. Comparison of tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) -immunoreactive cell size showed a tendency for smaller neurons in transgenic animals, but the difference was not statistically significant. We conclude that dopamine beta-hydroxylase(DBH) : brain-derived neurotrophic factor(BDNF) transgenic mice show increased number of tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) -immunoreactive cells in the <BrainRegion>midbrain</BrainRegion>. We propose that brain-derived neurotrophic factor(BDNF) rescues dopaminergic neurons from the perinatal period of developmental cell death as a consequence of increased anterograde transport of the neurotrophin via the coeruleonigral projection.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Target dependence of <BrainRegion>hypoglossal</BrainRegion> motor neurons during development in maturity.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>We have investigated the target dependence of <BrainRegion>hypoglossal</BrainRegion> motor neurons in postnatal rats by transecting the <BrainRegion>hypoglossal nerve</BrainRegion> and preventing reinnervation of the tongue. After transection in early postnatal life, approximately 60% of <BrainRegion>hypoglossal</BrainRegion> motor neurons die and surviving neurons are markedly atrophic compared to contralateral controls. In maturity, there is also substantial neuronal atrophy and about 30% of motor neurons appear to die after the procedure. However, most <BrainRegion>hypoglossal</BrainRegion> neurons in adults survive transection for periods up to 1 year. The adult response is present by 3 weeks of age. The time course of neuronal atrophy and death after permanent target deprivation was investigated in adult animals. One month after the <BrainRegion>hypoglossal nerve</BrainRegion> was deflected, there was marked axonal atrophy, although somatic atrophy was minimal. By 3 months after the procedure substantial neuronal atrophy and apparent cell loss (about 30%) had occurred. There was little change between 3 and 6 months. We conclude that <BrainRegion>hypoglossal</BrainRegion> motor neurons are influenced by connections with their targets in postnatal life. Even in maturity, neurons require target connections for maintenance of axonal and somatic morphology. However, the majority of motor neurons in adult animals can survive target deprivation for prolonged periods.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Subcellular localization of GABAB receptor subunits in rat <BrainRegion>globus pallidus</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The inhibitory amino acid gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the major neurotransmitter in the <BrainRegion>globus pallidus</BrainRegion>. Although electrophysiological studies have indicated that functional gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) (B) receptors exist in rat <BrainRegion>globus pallidus</BrainRegion>, the subcellular localization of gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) (B) receptor subunits and their spatial relationship to glutamatergic and gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) ergic synapses are unknown. Here, we use pre-embedding immunogold labeling to study the subcellular localization of gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) (B) receptor subunits, gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) (B1) and gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) (B2), in <BrainRegion>globus pallidus</BrainRegion> neurons and identified populations of afferent terminals. Immunolabeling for gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) (B1) and gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) (B2) was observed throughout the <BrainRegion>globus pallidus</BrainRegion>, with gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) (B1) more strongly expressed in perikarya and gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) (B2) mainly expressed in the neuropil. Electron microscopic analysis revealed that the majority of gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) (B1) labeling was localized within the cytoplasm, whereas most of gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) (B2) labeling was associated with the plasma membrane. At the subcellular level, both the gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) (B1) and gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) (B2) immunogold labeling was localized at pre- and postsynaptic sites. At asymmetric, putative excitatory, synapses, gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) (B1) and gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) (B2) immunogold labeling was found at perisynaptic sites of both pre- and postsynaptic specializations. Double immunolabeling, using the vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGLUT2), revealed the glutamatergic nature of most immunogold-labeled asymmetric synapses. At symmetric, putative gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) ergic, synapses, including those formed by anterogradely labeled striatopallidal terminals, gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) (B1) and gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) (B2) immunogold labeling was found in the main body of both pre- and postsynaptic specializations. These results demonstrate the existence of presynaptic gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) (B) auto- and heteroreceptors and postsynaptic gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) (B) receptors, which may be involved in modulating synaptic transmission in the <BrainRegion>globus pallidus</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Isoform-specific distribution of the plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase in the rat brain.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Regulation of cytoplasmic calcium is crucial both for proper neuronal function and cell survival. The concentration of Ca2+ in cytoplasm of a neuron at rest is 10,000 times lower than in the extracellular space, pointing to the importance of the transporters that extrude intracellular Ca2+. The family of plasma membrane calcium-dependent ATPases (PMCAs) represent a major component of the Ca2+ regulatory system. However, little information is available on the regional and cellular distribution of these calcium pumps. We used immunohistochemistry to investigate the distribution of each of the four PMCA isoforms (PMCA1-4) in the rat brain. Each isoform exhibited a remarkably precise and distinct pattern of distribution. In many cases, PMCA isoforms in a single brain structure were differentially expressed within different classes of neurons, and within different subcellular compartments. These data show that each isoform is independently organized and suggest that plasma membrane calcium-dependent ATPases(PMCAs) may play a more complex role in calcium homeostasis than generally recognized.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Neurogenesis of the cat&apos;s <BrainRegion>primary visual cortex</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The 3H-thymidine method of birth-dating was used to determine when the cells belonging to each of the principal cellular layers of the cat&apos;s <BrainRegion>primary visual cortex</BrainRegion> are generated. In order to detect systematic differences in the position of radioactively labeled cells following 3H-thymidine administration at different prenatal ages, a geometric method was devised to represent the distribution of labeled cells in the form of depth histograms. Results show that <BrainRegion>visual cortical</BrainRegion> neurogenesis occurs largely during the second half of gestation between embryonic day 31 (E31) and E57. Cells of layer 6 are generated early, between embryonic day 31(E31) and E38, whereas cells destined for successively more superficial layers are generated at progressively later times. Layer 4 cells, the principal targets of geniculocortical afferents, are generated between E37 and E44. In addition, a special population of cells embedded in the white matter below layer 6 was found to be produced throughout the week-long period immediately prior to the onset of layer 6 neurogenesis. Overall, this radial pattern of cortical neurogenesis closely resembles the inside-first, outside-last, spatiotemporal sequence of development described for the monkey&apos;s <BrainRegion>primary visual cortex</BrainRegion> (Rakic, &apos;74). In addition to finding this pronounced gradient in the radial dimension, we were also able to detect a less pronounced gradient along the tangential dimension: neurons destined for any given layer in the <BrainRegion>anterior part of the cortex</BrainRegion> (inferior visual field representation) are generated slightly in advance of neurons destined for more posterior regions (superior visual field). However even our more quantitative histogram analysis failed to reveal a mediolateral (central to peripheral visual field) gradient within <BrainRegion>area 17</BrainRegion>. In the cat, layers 6, 5, and 4 each take about a week to be generated, although their total cell numbers and packing densities differ in the adult. About 2 weeks are required to produce the cells of layers 2 and 3 combined. Furthermore, we found that neurons belonging to different layers and different morphological classes can be generated simultaneously. This suggests that the identity of a <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> neuron is not solely a function of the time of neurogenesis.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Ultrastructural localization of serotonin 2A and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors in somata and dendrites of single neurons within rat <BrainRegion>dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Both glutamate and serotonin are potent modulators of autonomic functions involving the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion> (NTS) and the <BrainRegion>dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus</BrainRegion> (DMNV) at the level of the <BrainRegion>area postrema</BrainRegion>. Moreover, many of the dendrites in this <BrainRegion>nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion>(NTS) region express both N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and serotonin (5HT) 2A receptors, and some of these dendrites may arise from the adjacent <BrainRegion>dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus</BrainRegion>(DMNV) . Thus, single neurons in <BrainRegion>dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus</BrainRegion>(DMNV) may also express both receptors. To test this hypothesis, we used electron microscopic immunocytochemistry for dual localization of the essential R1 subunit of the N-methyl-D-aspartate(NMDA) receptor (NR1) and the 5HT2A receptor in rat <BrainRegion>intermediate dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus</BrainRegion>(DMNV) , a region serving mainly gastrointestinal functions. Gold particles representing NR1 and peroxidase reaction product for 5HT2A receptors were seen in the cytoplasm, as well as on distinct segments of the plasma membrane of many dendrites. Of the NR1-labeled dendrites, 31% (254/814) also contained 5HT2A immunoreactivity; among the 5HT2A-labeled dendrites, 52% (254/485) expressed NR1. The 5HT2A labeling was also present in numerous small unmyelinated axons, axon terminals, and glial processes. These profiles were largely without NR1 immunoreactivity, although NR1 was detected in some of the dendrites postsynaptic to 5HT2A-labeled terminals. Our results suggest that calcium entry through N-methyl-D-aspartate(NMDA) channels and 5HT2A receptor activation may dramatically affect postsynaptic excitability of single neurons in the <BrainRegion>dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus</BrainRegion>(DMNV) . In addition, the findings also indicate that the 5HT2A receptor is strategically positioned for involvement in modulation of the presynaptic release of neurotransmitters affecting the postsynaptic activity of <BrainRegion>dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus</BrainRegion>(DMNV) neurons responsive to N-methyl-D-aspartate(NMDA) activation.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Neurogenesis of glutamic acid decarboxylase immunoreactive cells in the <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion> of the mouse. I: <BrainRegion>Regio superior and regio inferior</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The neurogenetic gradients of neurons showing glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) immunoreactivity were determined in the <BrainRegion>regio superior and in the regio inferior</BrainRegion> of the mouse <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion>. Pregnant C57Bl mice received pulse injections of (3H)thymidine from E11 through E17 (E0 being the day of mating). Distributions of (3H)thymidine-labeled, glutamic acid decarboxylase(GAD) -positive neurons in the different <BrainRegion>strata of the hippocampus proper</BrainRegion> were recorded in adult animals. glutamic acid decarboxylase(GAD) -positive neurons in this region are generated prenatally. Radial gradients of neurogenesis of glutamic acid decarboxylase(GAD) -positive cells are characterized by two main features: 1) with the exception of the <BrainRegion>stratum lacunosum-moleculare</BrainRegion> and its interface with the <BrainRegion>stratum radiatum</BrainRegion>, glutamic acid decarboxylase(GAD) -positive neurons of the plexiform strata are generated before those destined for the pyramidal layer; 2) within the pyramidal layer, glutamic acid decarboxylase(GAD) -positive cells are positioned according to an inside-out sequence. In the transverse axis, neurogenesis of glutamic acid decarboxylase(GAD) -positive cells follows a regio inferior to regio superior gradient. This gradient is due to prolonged neurogenesis of glutamic acid decarboxylase(GAD) -positive cells for the pyramidal layer in the <BrainRegion>regio superior</BrainRegion>. Given the selective laminar disposition of the GABAergic interneurons in the <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion>, the present authors explored whether or not the diverse types of these interneurons could have specific birth dates and concluded that no relationship exists between birth dates and adult phenotypes of glutamic acid decarboxylase(GAD) -immunoreactive cells in the mouse <BrainRegion>hippocampus proper</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Relationship of retinotopic ordering of axons in the optic pathway to the formation of visual maps in central targets.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>We examined in rats the relationship between the ordering of <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> axons in the optic pathway and the formation of a retinotopically organized projection to their primary target, the <BrainRegion>contralateral superior colliculus</BrainRegion> (SC). We have previously found that axons labeled by focal injections of 1,1&apos;-dioctadecyl 3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI) made in <BrainRegion>temporal or nasal retina</BrainRegion> of perinatal rats commonly mistarget along the medial-lateral and rostral-caudal axes of the <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion>(SC) . By postnatal day (P) 11-12, the retinocollicular projection attains an adult-like topography. Incorrectly targeted axons or axon segments are removed; axons that persist terminate in the topographically appropriate part of the <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion>(SC) (Simon and O&apos;Leary: Dev Biol 137:125, 1990). In the present study, we made similar 1,1'-dioctadecyl 3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate(DiI) injections, covering less than 2% of the <BrainRegion>retinal area</BrainRegion>, in <BrainRegion>peripheral temporal, nasal, superior, or inferior retina</BrainRegion>, in rats of two age groups, embryonic day (E) 21 to P (postnatal day) 2 and P11-P17. Whole mounts of <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>optic nerve and tract</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion>(SC) , and cross sections of the <BrainRegion>optic nerve</BrainRegion>, were examined. In E21-P2 rats, <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> axons labeled from each <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> site are diffusely distributed in the <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion>(SC) , and poorly ordered in the optic pathway. In <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>, labeled axons travel in fascicles directly from the injection site to the <BrainRegion>optic disc</BrainRegion>, but neighbor relationships begin to degrade as fascicles split and mix. Retinotopic order is virtually lost in the <BrainRegion>optic nerve</BrainRegion>; axons labeled from each injection site disperse throughout its cross-sectional area, but the labeled axons tend to be concentrated toward a specific half of the nerve depending upon their <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> origin. This slight tendency toward retinotopic order increases in the optic tract, but axons are still poorly ordered as they leave the tract and enter the <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion>(SC) . Targeting errors along the medial-lateral axis of the <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion>(SC) , but apparently not along its rostral-caudal axis, are related to the positioning of axons across the width of the optic tract. In P11-P17 rats, axons labeled from each injection site arborize only in a small, topographically correct part of the <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion>(SC) . However, the distributions of labeled <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> axons observed in whole mounts of the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> and optic pathway have a degree of disorder similar to those in E21-P2 rats. Further, the scatter of labeled axons in <BrainRegion>optic nerve</BrainRegion> cross sections is comparable in both age groups. Therefore, the emergence of topographic order in the retinocollicular projection is not accompanied by an emergence of a retinotopic ordering of axons in the <BrainRegion>optic nerve</BrainRegion>.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Non-NMDA glutamate receptors are present throughout the primate <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>To determine the distributions of glutamate receptors throughout the macaque <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion>, we utilized highly specific antipeptide antibodies to visualize alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate receptor subunits (GluR1, GluR2 and GluR3 [designated as GluR2/3], and GluR4); kainate receptor subunits (GluR6 and GluR7, [designated as GluR6/7]), and a metabotropic receptor (mGluR1 alpha). The results indicate that these glutamate receptors are distributed differentially throughout the monkey <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion>. alpha-Amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate receptors are the dominant non-N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptors within the monkey <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion>, and the GluR2 subunit is most abundant. GluR1-immunoreactive neurons and neuropil are observed predominantly in the <BrainRegion>tuberal and mammillary nuclei</BrainRegion>. GluR2/3-immunoreactive neurons and neuropil have a broader distribution within <BrainRegion>preoptic, anterior, tuberal, and caudal regions</BrainRegion>. Separate (but partially overlapping) distributions of GluR1- and GluR2/3-immunoreactive neurons were found, suggesting that the GluR1, GluR2, and/or GluR3 subunits may be coexpressed in subsets of <BrainRegion>hypothalamic</BrainRegion> neurons. In contrast, GluR4 immunoreactivity was expressed minimally within monkey <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion>. GluR6/7 immunoreactivity was enriched selectively within the <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion>. mGluR1 alpha immunoreactivity was present in the <BrainRegion>mammillary complex</BrainRegion>. The localization of non-N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptor subunits to neurons throughout the macaque <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion> provides further evidence for the glutamatergic regulation of neuroendocrine, autonomic, and <BrainRegion>limbic</BrainRegion> circuits. Differential distributions of glutamate receptor subunits may increase the dynamic range of the effects of presynaptic glutamate, allowing for the regulation of several distinct functions subserved by <BrainRegion>hypothalamic</BrainRegion> neurons.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Dopaminergic innervation of the <BrainRegion>basal ganglia</BrainRegion> in the squirrel monkey as revealed by tyrosine hydroxylase immunohistochemistry.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The organization of the dopaminergic mesostriatal fibers and their patterns of innervation of the <BrainRegion>basal ganglia</BrainRegion> in the squirrel monkey (Saimiri sciureus) were studied immunohistochemically with an antiserum raised against tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). Numerous fibers arose from midbrain tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) -positive cell bodies of the <BrainRegion>substantia nigra pars compacta (group A9), the retrorubral area (group A8), and the lateral portion of the ventral tegmental area</BrainRegion> (group A10). These fibers accumulated dorsomedially to the <BrainRegion>rostral pole of the substantia nigra</BrainRegion> where they formed a massive bundle that coursed through the <BrainRegion>prerubral field</BrainRegion> and ascended along the <BrainRegion>laterodorsal aspect of the medial fore-brain bundle</BrainRegion> in the <BrainRegion>lateral hypothalamus</BrainRegion>. Some ventrally located fibers ran throughout the rostrocaudal extent of the <BrainRegion>lateral preopticohypothalamic area</BrainRegion> and could be followed up to the <BrainRegion>olfactory tubercle</BrainRegion>, whereas other fibers turned laterodorsally to invade the head of the <BrainRegion>caudate nucleus</BrainRegion>. At more <BrainRegion>dorsal levels in the lateral hypothalamus</BrainRegion>, many fiber fascicles detached themselves from the main bundle and swept laterally to reach the <BrainRegion>globus pallidus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>putamen</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>amygdala</BrainRegion>. Several tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) -positive fibers coursed along the dorsal surface of the <BrainRegion>subthalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>, and some invaded the dorsomedial third of this structure. The remaining portion of the <BrainRegion>subthalamic nucleus</BrainRegion> contained relatively few tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) -positive elements. In contrast, the <BrainRegion>globus pallidus</BrainRegion> received a dense dopaminergic innervation deriving mostly from two fascicles that coursed backward along the two major output pathways of the <BrainRegion>pallidum</BrainRegion>: the <BrainRegion>lenticular fasciculus caudodorsally</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>ansa lenticularis rostroventrally</BrainRegion>. At the <BrainRegion>pallidal level</BrainRegion>, the labeled fibres merged within the <BrainRegion>medullary laminae</BrainRegion> and arborized profusely in the <BrainRegion>internal pallidal segment</BrainRegion> and less abundantly in the <BrainRegion>external pallidal segment</BrainRegion>. However, the <BrainRegion>caudoventral portion of the external pallidum</BrainRegion> displayed a dense field of tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) -positive axonal varicosities. Other fibers ran through the <BrainRegion>dorsal two-thirds of the external pallidum</BrainRegion> en route to the <BrainRegion>putamen</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>striatum</BrainRegion> contained a multitude of thin axonal varicosities among which a few long and varicosed fibers were scattered. These immunoreactive neuronal profiles were rather uniformly distributed along the <BrainRegion>rostrocaudal extent of the striatum</BrainRegion> but appeared slightly more numerous in the <BrainRegion>ventral striatum</BrainRegion> than in the <BrainRegion>dorsal striatum</BrainRegion>. The pattern of distribution of the tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) -positive axonal varicosities in the <BrainRegion>dorsal striatum</BrainRegion> was markedly heterogeneous: it consisted of typical zones of poor tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) immunoreactivity lying within a matrix of dense terminal labeling.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Changes in mouse barrel synapses consequent to sensory deprivation from birth.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Neonatal sensory deprivation induced by whisker trimming affects significantly the functional organization of receptive fields in adult <BrainRegion>barrel cortex</BrainRegion>. In this study, the effects of deprivation on thalamocortical synapses and on asymmetrical and symmetrical synapses not of <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> origin were examined. Thalamocortical synapses were labeled by lesion-induced degeneration in adult (postnatal day 60) mice subjected to whisker trimming from birth, other synaptic types were unlabeled. Brains were processed for electron microscopy, and numerical densities of synapses were evaluated by using stereologic approaches for whisker trimmed vs. control animals. Results demonstrated no change in nonthalamic, asymmetrical synapses; however, a decrease of 52% in the numerical density of symmetrical synapses (46.3 vs. 88.5 million per mm(3); Z = -2.121; P &amp;lt; 0.05) and a decrease of 43% in the numerical density of thalamocortical synapses (57.5 vs. 102.33 million per mm(3); Z = -2.121; P &lt; 0.05) were observed after deprivation. Thus, experience-dependent plasticity of receptive fields in <BrainRegion>barrel cortex</BrainRegion> involves directly axons of both extrinsic and intracortical origin. The proportion of thalamocortical axospinous to axodendritic synapses was the same in control vs. deprived animals: in each instance, 80% of the synapses were axospinous (Z = 0.85; P = 0.2). These results suggest that neither excitatory neurons, whose thalamocortical synapses are primarily axospinous, nor inhibitory neurons, whose thalamocortical synapses are mainly axodendritic (White [1989] <BrainRegion>Cortical</BrainRegion> Circuits. Synaptic Organization of the <BrainRegion>Cerebral Cortex</BrainRegion>; Structure, Function, and Theory. 1989; Boston: Birkhauser), are affected preferentially by the deprivation-associated decrease in thalamocortical synapses.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Ontogeny of steroid accumulation in spinal lumbar motoneurons of the rat: implications for androgen&apos;s site of action during synapse elimination.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Androgens influence the postnatal development of motoneurons in the <BrainRegion>spinal nucleus of the bulbocavernosus</BrainRegion> (SNB) by regulating neuromuscular synapse elimination, the process through which multiple axonal inputs are retracted from each muscle fiber until single innervation is established. In the rat levator ani (LA), one of the target muscles for <BrainRegion>spinal nucleus of the bulbocavernosus</BrainRegion>(SNB) motoneurons, much of this loss of multiple innervation can be prevented by prepubertal androgen treatment. We used steroid autoradiography to measure the ontogeny of steroid accumulation in the <BrainRegion>spinal nucleus of the bulbocavernosus</BrainRegion>(SNB) and the <BrainRegion>retrodorsolateral nucleus</BrainRegion> (RDLN), two motoneuronal groups thought to differ in their sensitivity to androgens. <BrainRegion>Spinal cord</BrainRegion> tissue was analyzed from castrated male rats at 7, 14, 21, and 60 days of age after injection of radiolabelled testosterone. <BrainRegion>spinal nucleus of the bulbocavernosus</BrainRegion>(SNB) and <BrainRegion>retrodorsolateral nucleus</BrainRegion>(RDLN) motoneurons differ in the ontogeny of androgen accumulation. Over 80% of <BrainRegion>spinal nucleus of the bulbocavernosus</BrainRegion>(SNB) motoneurons develop the capacity to accumulate androgen during the second week after birth, during the period when androgen regulates synapse elimination in the levator ani(LA) . In contrast, androgen accumulation in <BrainRegion>retrodorsolateral nucleus</BrainRegion>(RDLN) motoneurons develops much later (after 21 days). These data suggest that androgen may act directly on <BrainRegion>spinal nucleus of the bulbocavernosus</BrainRegion>(SNB) motoneurons to influence synapse elimination.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Olivocerebellar connections in sheep studied with the retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>We describe here the morphology of the <BrainRegion>inferior olive</BrainRegion> and the localization of labeled cells after HRP injections into various <BrainRegion>lobules of vermis</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>hemisphere of the cerebellum</BrainRegion> of the sheep. The <BrainRegion>medial part of the caudal half of the medial accessory olive</BrainRegion> projects to a <BrainRegion>medial zone in the anterior lobe</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>simple lobule</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>lobules VII and VIII</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>lateral part of the medial accessory olive</BrainRegion> projects to more lateral parts of these lobules with the exception of <BrainRegion>lobule VII</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>group beta</BrainRegion> projects in a differential manner to the <BrainRegion>lateral parts of the lobules VII and VIII</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>medial parts of the lobules IX and X</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>dorsomedial cell column</BrainRegion> projects to <BrainRegion>lobules VIII, IX, and X</BrainRegion>; the connections of the <BrainRegion>dorsal cap</BrainRegion> are restricted to <BrainRegion>lobule X</BrainRegion>. Fibers from the <BrainRegion>caudal limb of the dorsal accessory olive</BrainRegion> terminate in the <BrainRegion>B zone</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>simple lobule</BrainRegion>, and in <BrainRegion>lobule VIII</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>rostral half of the medial accessory olive</BrainRegion> projects to <BrainRegion>lobule IX</BrainRegion> and to the hemisphere. The other projections of the <BrainRegion>accessory olives</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>principal olive</BrainRegion> to the hemisphere are similar to those reported for the cat. An accessory cell group in the sheep, located between the <BrainRegion>principal and the dorsal accessory olive</BrainRegion>, has connections with the <BrainRegion>caudal vermis</BrainRegion> and the hemisphere.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>5&apos;-nucleotidase in the rodent <BrainRegion>ventral striatum</BrainRegion>: relation to the distribution of leu-enkephalin, cell clusters, and <BrainRegion>infralimbic cortical</BrainRegion> innervation.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The goal of this study was to determine the compartmental organization of 5&apos;-nucleotidase within the rodent <BrainRegion>ventral striatum</BrainRegion> and to compare the distribution of 5&apos;-nucleotidase with that of leu-enkephalin, cell clusters, and <BrainRegion>infralimbic cortical</BrainRegion> innervation. In the core, 5&apos;-nucleotidase is present in several contiguous patchy structures that are in register with leu-enkephalin compartments. In the shell, 5'-nucleotidase is concentrated in a longitudinal band along the septal border. This "medial band" extends from the rostral pole of the <BrainRegion>ventral striatum</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>bed nucleus of stria terminalis</BrainRegion>. The ventral portion of the medial band is in register with a cluster of cells, located medial to the most <BrainRegion>dorsal island of Cajella</BrainRegion>. A second 5&apos;-nucleotidase compartment along the border of the core and shell is in register with a cell cluster and is most evident at caudal levels of the <BrainRegion>ventral striatum</BrainRegion>. The innervation of the <BrainRegion>ventral striatum</BrainRegion> by the <BrainRegion>infralimbic cortex</BrainRegion> is denser in the shell than in the core. In the shell, fibers from the superficial layers of the <BrainRegion>infralimbic cortex</BrainRegion> tend to avoid the 5&apos;-nucleotidase-rich cell clusters and terminate in areas of moderate 5'-nucleotidase density. By contrast, fibers from the deep layers terminate in the <BrainRegion>ventral striatum</BrainRegion> without regard to the 5&apos;-nucleotidase-rich cell clusters. Overall, the compartmental structure of 5'-nucleotidase in the <BrainRegion>ventral striatum</BrainRegion> segregates projections from different layers of the <BrainRegion>infralimbic cortex</BrainRegion>. Dense 5&apos;-nucleotidase compartments are innervated by neurons in the deep layers of the <BrainRegion>infralimbic cortex</BrainRegion>. The area of moderate 5&apos;-nucleotidase density surrounding the 5'-nucleotidase compartments is innervated by neurons in both the superficial and deep layers.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Differences in spinal distribution and neurochemical phenotype of colonic afferents in mouse and rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Visceral pain is a prevalent clinical problem and one of the most common ailments for which patients seek medical attention. Recent studies have described many of the physiological properties of visceral afferents, but not much is known regarding their anatomical characteristics. To determine the spinal distribution and neurochemical phenotype of colonic afferents in rodents, Alexa Fluor-conjugated cholera toxin-beta (CTB) was injected subserosally into the proximal and distal portions of the descending colon in Sprague Dawley rats and C57Bl/6 mice. Dorsal root ganglia (T10-S2) were processed for fluorescent immunohistochemistry and visualized by confocal microscopy. In the mouse, cholera toxin-beta(CTB) -positive neurons were most numerous in the lumbosacral region (LS; L6-S1), with a smaller contribution in the thoracolumbar ganglia (TL; T13-L1). In contrast, cholera toxin-beta(CTB) -positive neurons in the rat were most numerous in the thoracolumbar ganglia(TL) ganglia, with a smaller contribution in the lumbosacral region(LS) ganglia. The vast majority of cholera toxin-beta(CTB) -positive neurons in both mouse and rat were positive for TRPV1 and CGRP and most likely unmyelinated, in that most colonic afferents were not positive for neurofilament heavy chain. In the mouse, the thoracolumbar ganglia(TL) ganglia had a significantly higher percentage of TRPV1- and CGRP-positive neurons than did the lumbosacral region(LS) ganglia, whereas no differences were observed in the rat. The high incidence of TRPV1-positive colonic afferents in rodents suggests that hypersensitivity from the viscera may be partially a TRPV1-mediated event, thereby providing a suitable target for the treatment of visceral pain.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Sensory organ generation in the chicken <BrainRegion>inner ear</BrainRegion>: contributions of bone morphogenetic protein 4, serrate1, and lunatic fringe.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The chicken <BrainRegion>inner ear</BrainRegion> is a remarkably complex structure consisting of eight morphologically distinct sensory organs. Unraveling how these sensory organs are specified during development is key to understanding how such a complex structure is generated. Previously, we have shown that each sensory organ in the chicken <BrainRegion>inner ear</BrainRegion> arises independently in the rudimentary otocyst based on Bone morphogenetic protein 4 (Bmp4) expression. Here, we compare the expression of Bone morphogenetic protein 4(Bmp4) with two other putative sensory organ markers, Lunatic Fringe (L-fng) and chicken Serrate1 (Ser1), both of which are components of the Notch signaling pathway. Lunatic Fringe(L-fng) and Serrate1(Ser1) expression domains were asymmetrically distributed in the otic cup. At this early stage, expression of Lunatic Fringe(L-fng) is similar to Delta1 (Dl1), in an anteroventral domain apparently corresponding to the neurogenic region, while Serrate1(Ser1) is expressed at both the anterior and posterior poles. By the otocyst stage, the expression of both Lunatic Fringe(L-fng) and Serrate1(Ser1) largely coincided in the medial region. All presumptive sensory organs, as identified by Bone morphogenetic protein 4(Bmp4) expression, arose within the broad Lunatic Fringe(L-fng) - and Serrate1(Ser1) -positive domain, indicating the existence of a sensory-competent region in the rudimentary otocyst. In addition, there is a qualitative difference in the levels of expression between Lunatic Fringe(L-fng) and Serrate1(Ser1) such that Lunatic Fringe(L-fng) expression was stronger in the ventral anterior, whereas Serrate1(Ser1) was stronger in the dorsal posterior region of this broad domain. This early difference in expression may presage the differences among sensory organs as they arise from this sensory competent zone.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Stereological estimation of the total number of neurons in the murine <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion> using the optical disector.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Using a stereological method, the optical disector, we examined three inbred strains of mice (NZB/BINJ, DBA/2, and C57BL/6J) for morphological differences in volume, neuronal number, and density of the pyramidal cell and dentate gyrus granule cell layers of the hippocampus. We found significant differences in volume and neuronal number for both regions between the three strains at 9 weeks of age, but only modest differences in neuronal density. The <BrainRegion>left dentate</BrainRegion> volume was 90% larger in the NZB strain and 70% greater in the DBA strain (P&amp;lt;0.0001), and the left pyramidal cell layer was 144% larger in the NZB strain and 150% larger in the DBA strain, than in the B6 strain (P&lt;0.0001). Neuron number in the left dentate was 81% greater in NZB and 37% greater in DBA (P&lt;0.001), and in the left pyramidal cell layer 118% greater in the NZB and 92% greater in the DBA (P&lt;0.01). Differences in neuronal density of the <BrainRegion>left dentate</BrainRegion> were not significant (P = 0.060, ns). For the left pyramidal cell layer, neuronal density was 14% greater in B6 and 34% greater in NZB than the DBA strain (P = 0.016). No significant differences were found in left-right laterality, or according to sex. We found that strain accounted for 60% of the variance in <BrainRegion>hippocampal</BrainRegion> volume and 44% of neuron number. These differences thus mainly reflect genetic variation in <BrainRegion>hippocampal</BrainRegion> volume and may have important implications for brain evolution, behaviour, and human diseases where <BrainRegion>hippocampal</BrainRegion> degeneration is involved.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Sympathetic innervation of the <BrainRegion>supratentorial dura mater</BrainRegion> of the rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The origin, density, and distribution of sympathetic nerve fibers in the <BrainRegion>supratentorial dura mater</BrainRegion> of the rat were examined in detail in the current study by using wheat germ agglutinin horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) retrograde tracing procedures, glyoxylic acid-induced fluorescence, and dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH) immunocytochemical staining of dural whole mount preparations. Application of wheat germ agglutinin horseradish peroxidase(WGA-HRP) to the <BrainRegion>superior sagittal sinus</BrainRegion> and adjacent areas of the <BrainRegion>supratentorial dura mater</BrainRegion> labeled numerous neurons in each of the left and right superior cervical ganglia. Glyoxylic acid and dopamine beta-hydroxylase(DBH) immunocytochemical staining of fixed dural whole mount preparations revealed prominent plexuses of sympathetic nerves about the middle <BrainRegion>meningeal</BrainRegion> artery and its branches, about the <BrainRegion>superior sagittal and transverse sinuses</BrainRegion>, and &quot;free" within the <BrainRegion>dura mater</BrainRegion>, i.e., apparently unassociated with any vasculature. Significantly, in all of these areas, the density of sympathetic innervation revealed in this study was considerably greater than that previously demonstrated by other workers. An impressive population of mast cells also was observed within the <BrainRegion>dura mater</BrainRegion> of the glyoxylic acid-treated preparations. The majority of these cells were perivascular; however, a significant number were also present within the dura unrelated to the vasculature, and occasional cells were seen in close apposition to fluorescent sympathetic nerve fibers. Taken together, the identification of a robust sympathetic plexus and prominent mast cell population associated with a <BrainRegion>dura mater</BrainRegion> that also receives significant sensory projections from the trigeminal system raises interest regarding the functional interactions of these elements. These observations warrant further consideration regarding their role in the pathogenesis of vascular headache and head pain.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Postnatal apoptosis, development, and sex difference in the <BrainRegion>lateral septum</BrainRegion> of rats.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>To determine whether apoptosis is involved in the formation of the structure and morphological sex difference of the <BrainRegion>lateral septum</BrainRegion> (LS), the postnatal developmental changes in the number of apoptotic cells were examined in the <BrainRegion>lateral septum</BrainRegion>(LS) on postnatal day 1 (PD1 = birth day), 4, 6, 8, 11, 16, and 31 in male and female rats. Apoptotic cells were immunohistochemically detected by antibody against single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) or active caspase-3. The volume of the <BrainRegion>lateral septum</BrainRegion>(LS) was also measured and was found to increase with age. The number of apoptotic cells detected by anti- single-stranded DNA(ssDNA) in the <BrainRegion>lateral septum</BrainRegion>(LS) increased from PD1 to PD8 but decreased after PD11. Also, the <BrainRegion>lateral septum</BrainRegion>(LS) was divided into <BrainRegion>dorsal, intermediate, and ventral parts ( lateral septum(LS) d, lateral septum(LS) i, and lateral septum(LS) v)</BrainRegion>, and the volume and number of single-stranded DNA(ssDNA) -immunoreactive cells in each part were measured on PD6, 8, 11, 16, and 31. In both sexes, a large number of single-stranded DNA(ssDNA) -immunoreactive cells was found in the <BrainRegion>lateral septum(LS) d</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>lateral septum(LS) i</BrainRegion> on PD8 (but not on PD6) and in the <BrainRegion>lateral septum(LS) v</BrainRegion> on PD6 and PD8. On PD6, the number of active caspase-3-immunoreactive cells was significantly greater in the <BrainRegion>lateral septum(LS) v</BrainRegion> than in the <BrainRegion>lateral septum(LS) d</BrainRegion> or <BrainRegion>lateral septum(LS) i</BrainRegion>, in both sexes. Only the <BrainRegion>lateral septum(LS) i</BrainRegion> of males had a high number of single-stranded DNA(ssDNA) -immunoreacitve cells on PD16; the number was significantly greater than that of females of the same age. However, there was no significant sex difference in the number of active caspase-3-immunoreacitve cells in the <BrainRegion>lateral septum(LS) i</BrainRegion> on PD16. On PD31, the volume of the <BrainRegion>lateral septum(LS) i</BrainRegion> was significantly greater in females than in males. There was no sex difference in volume or number of apoptotic cells in the <BrainRegion>lateral septum(LS) d</BrainRegion> or <BrainRegion>lateral septum(LS) v</BrainRegion>. These findings indicate that loss of cells due to apoptosis, which is partially caused by activation of caspase-3, occurs in the l<BrainRegion>ateral septum</BrainRegion>(LS) during postnatal development, with regional differences. They also indicate that sex difference in caspase-3-independent apoptosis contributes to morphological sexual differentiation of the <BrainRegion>lateral septum(LS) i</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Retinal</BrainRegion> ganglion cells in the crucian carp (Carassius carassius). II. Overlap, shape and tangential orientation of dendritic trees.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Ganglion cells were studied in methylene blue stained flat-mounted <BrainRegion>retinas</BrainRegion>. Three categories of cells are described: small (S) and large (L) ganglion cells in the main ganglion cell layer, and large ganglion cells (LD) with somata more or less displaced into the inner plexiform layer. These LD cells have two to four very thick primary dendrites and are identifiable as ganglion cells by their axons. An analysis of published data reveals that the large ganglion cells of the crucian carp (type L and LD) have several striking characteristics in common with the large ganglion cells of the dogfish, the frog and the cat: (1) they are selectively stained by methylene blue; (2) they comprise only 2-5% of all the ganglion cells; (3) the large cells can be divided into two or three subtypes, and within each subtype the dendritic trees usually cover the <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> surface with a two- or threefold overlap.  New ganglion cells are formed from neuroblasts at the <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> margin and most dendrites first grow along this neuroblastic zone. Thus the main dendrites of the L and LD cells tend to be oriented parallel to the margin all around the periphery of a crucian carp retina. Independent of the size of the eye this parallel orientation disappears at the same relative distance from the margin (about one-third of the distance from the margin to the optic disc). If all L and LD cells are formed at the <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> margin and first develop oriented dendrites, we have to assume that the more randomly oriented dendritic trees in the <BrainRegion>central retina</BrainRegion> have undergone a reorganization.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Cerebellar corticonuclear projections in the red-eared turtle Pseudemys scripta elegans.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>In the present study the organization of the corticonuclear projections of the <BrainRegion>cerebellum</BrainRegion> in the red-eared turtle Pseudemys scripta elegans was investigated. To find out whether a zonal pattern exists in the <BrainRegion>cerebellar cortex</BrainRegion>, a topological analysis was made of the Purkinje cell layer of a Nissl-stained series of the <BrainRegion>cerebellum</BrainRegion>. This analysis showed a distinct, longitudinally oriented zonal pattern of Purkinje cells. In each <BrainRegion>cerebellar half</BrainRegion> a medial, an intermediate, and a lateral zone could be distinguished. This pattern appeared to correspond in part to an earlier subdivision of the reptilian <BrainRegion>cerebellum</BrainRegion> suggested by Larsell (&apos;26, '32, '67). In the experimental part of this study, the corticonuclear projections to the <BrainRegion>cerebellar nuclei</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>vestibular nuclear complex</BrainRegion> were demonstrated with the horseradish peroxidase (HRP) technique. All projections of the Purkinje cells appeared to be strictly ipsilateral. After horseradish peroxidase(HRP) slow-release gel implantations at various levels of the <BrainRegion>vestibular nuclear complex</BrainRegion>, longitudinally oriented areas of labeled Purkinje cells were found in the <BrainRegion>lateral part of the medial zone</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>intermediate zone</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>lateral zone</BrainRegion>. Two strips of Purkinje cells remained unlabeled: One in the <BrainRegion>rostrolateral part of the intermediate zone</BrainRegion>, and another in the <BrainRegion>medial part of the medial zone</BrainRegion>. After horseradish peroxidase(HRP) gel implantations in the <BrainRegion>cerebellar peduncle</BrainRegion> aimed at the <BrainRegion>medial and lateral cerebellar nuclei</BrainRegion>, respectively. Purkinje cells in the latter two strips were labeled. The present results indicate that the corticonuclear projections to the <BrainRegion>medial cerebellar nucleus</BrainRegion> arise in the <BrainRegion>medial part of the medial zone</BrainRegion> and those to the <BrainRegion>lateral cerebellar nucleus</BrainRegion> in the <BrainRegion>rostrolateral part of the intermediate zone</BrainRegion>. It can be concluded that <BrainRegion>cerebellar zones</BrainRegion> as demonstrated in the turtle Pseudemys scripta elegans, are phylogenetically very old and may represent the basic functional circuit of the <BrainRegion>cerebellum</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Compensatory climbing fiber innervation after unilateral pedunculotomy in the newborn rat: origin and topographic organization.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>In neonatal rats the unilateral transection of the <BrainRegion>cerebellar peduncles</BrainRegion> causes a fast and complete degeneration of the <BrainRegion>contralateral inferior olive</BrainRegion>. Axons from the <BrainRegion>remaining olive</BrainRegion> recross the <BrainRegion>cerebellar</BrainRegion> midline and partially innervate the <BrainRegion>deprived hemicortex</BrainRegion>. Analysis of the topographic organization of this compensatory projection studied with the axonal tracing method provided the following results: Retrograde tracing experiments revealed that the bulk of compensatory afferents originates from neurons in the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral medial accessory olive</BrainRegion>, especially from its medial region, whereas afferents from the <BrainRegion>principal olive</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>dorsal accessory olive</BrainRegion> contribute to a much lesser degree. In case of incomplete neonatal pedunculotomy, neurons with a similar location in the ipsilateral intact <BrainRegion>olive</BrainRegion> still contribute to the innervation of the partially deprived <BrainRegion>hemicortex</BrainRegion>, along with the atrophic <BrainRegion>contralateral olive</BrainRegion>. Moreover, these experiments revealed important information about the organization of the compensation. Although its specificity was not totally maintained, the mediolateral distribution of sprouted afferents in the <BrainRegion>cerebellum</BrainRegion> matched the caudorostral disposition of parent neurons in the <BrainRegion>olive</BrainRegion>, as in the case in normal olivocerebellar projection. Anterograde studies showed that compensatory fibers recrossing the <BrainRegion>cerebellar</BrainRegion> midline spread throughout the whole extent of the deprived <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion> and terminate solely in the molecular layer as typical climbing fibers. The latter were not homogeneously distributed, their density being markedly reduced according to a mediolateral gradient. Compensatory projection followed a sagittal striped pattern, as does the normal climbing fiber projection. Moreover, if the <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion> is divided broadly into <BrainRegion>vermal, intermediate, and hemispheral regions</BrainRegion>, an apparent reciprocity seems to exist concerning the relative involvement of the various <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> subdivision in both <BrainRegion>hemicerebella</BrainRegion>. Our present results indicate that the immature olivocerebellar system is capable of anatomical plasticity, although to a limited extent. More important, they suggest that a certain degree of specificity is maintained during the process of sprouting, resulting in a topographical arrangement of the transcommissural climbing fiber projection. This indicates, in turn, that cues which guide the growth of olivocerebellar fibers during normal development could also direct the compensatory innervation.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Ultrastructural evidence for compensatory sprouting of climbing and mossy afferents to the <BrainRegion>cerebellar hemisphere</BrainRegion> after ipsilateral pedunculotomy in the newborn rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Unilateral section of the <BrainRegion>inferior and middle cerebellar peduncles</BrainRegion> was performed in rats at postnatal days 1 or 2. The ultrastructure of the <BrainRegion>cerebellar hemispheric cortex</BrainRegion> ipsilateral to the lesion was examined 3 months later. The absence of <BrainRegion>contralateral inferior olive</BrainRegion> and of <BrainRegion>ipsilateral middle peduncle</BrainRegion>, together with a marked regression of the <BrainRegion>contralateral pontine gray</BrainRegion>, were indicative of successful pedunculotomy. In spite of a relative atrophy of the hemisphere, its cytological structure was qualitatively normal. Mossy and climbing fibers were present and their terminal varicosities disclosed normal features. The density of climbing fiber terminals was reduced compared to control <BrainRegion>cerebellum</BrainRegion>, whereas the density of mossy terminals seemed unchanged. subsequent to the reduction of climbing afferents two subclasses, or types, of Purkinje cells were present: A &quot;normal" type characterized by its climbing fiber innervation and a "hyperspiny" type devoid of climbing fiber. In some of the adult rats pedunculotomized at birth, section of the <BrainRegion>contralateral peduncles</BrainRegion> was performed 24 hours before fixation. Terminal degeneration of climbing and mossy fibers was observed in the neonatally deprived hemisphere, providing the proof that these fibers result from a compensatory transcommissural sprouting of afferents destined to the <BrainRegion>contralateral hemicerebellum</BrainRegion>. These results demonstrate that the <BrainRegion>cerebellar cortex</BrainRegion> neonatally deprive of its main afferents can be innervated by climbing and mossy fibers through a process of transcommissural sprouting. Although the newly formed synapses maintain their target specificity, a functional reorganization must occur because of the altered distribution of both systems of afferents.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Regeneration of peptide-containing retinofugal axons into the <BrainRegion>optic tectum</BrainRegion> with reappearance of a substance P-containing lamina.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Twenty-five specimens of Rana pipiens were subjected to a unilateral crush of the <BrainRegion>optic nerve</BrainRegion>. Substance P (SP)-, leucine enkephalin (LENK)-, cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK8)-, and bombesin (BOM)-like immunoreactivities were analyzed in the <BrainRegion>retinae</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>optic nerves</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>optic tecta</BrainRegion>, 9 days to 9 months postoperatively, by means of immunohistochemical methods. Peptide-like immunoreactivity was observed in axons within the <BrainRegion>optic nerve</BrainRegion> stump <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> to the crush, as in previous studies (Kuljis and Karten, &apos;83b, Kuljis et al., '84). Peptide-containing retinofugal axons began traversing the lesion site between 10 and 20 days postoperatively, in progressively increasing numbers. Ten to 20 days following crush of the <BrainRegion>optic nerve</BrainRegion> Substance P(SP) -, leucine enkephalin(LENK) -, and CCK8-containing axons could be found in the <BrainRegion>cerebral stump of the optic nerve</BrainRegion> and in the <BrainRegion>optic chiasm</BrainRegion>, advancing to the side of the brain deafferented by the crush. The number of axons displaying peptide-like immunoreactivity within the <BrainRegion>optic nerve</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> or <BrainRegion>cerebral</BrainRegion> to the crush, and within the <BrainRegion>optic chiasm</BrainRegion> gradually decreased after 2-3 months. The <BrainRegion>optic nerve</BrainRegion> contralateral to the procedure displayed only occasional isolated peptide-containing fibers, as in normal <BrainRegion>optic nerves</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>retinae</BrainRegion> ipsilateral and contralateral to the crush exhibited no change in the normal pattern of peptide-like immunoreactivity, including the absence of demonstrable peptide-like immunoreactivity in the somata of <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> ganglion cells. The <BrainRegion>optic tectum</BrainRegion> deafferented by the procedure underwent modifications in the pattern of peptide-like immunoreactivity identical to those reported following unilateral eye enucleation (Kuljis and Karten, &apos;82a, '83a). The patterns of leucine enkephalin(LENK) -, CCK8-, and bombesin(BOM) -like immunoreactivities in the <BrainRegion>tectum</BrainRegion> were identical to those following irreversible <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> deafferentation as long as 9 months postoperatively. Substance P(SP) -like immunoreactivity, however, was gradually restored in layer 11 of Ramón y Cajal (&apos;46; layer D of Potter, '69) of the superficial (retinorecipient) neuropil 4-6 months postoperatively. The persistence of lamina-specific depletion patterns of leucine enkephalin(LENK) -, CCK8-, and bombesin(BOM) -like immunoreactivities in reafferented <BrainRegion>tecta</BrainRegion> represents a puzzling observation. The latter findings contrast sharply with the recovery of Substance P(SP) -like immunoreactivity, which occurs long after apparently complete restitution of the retinofugal projection, as shown by anatomical (Stelzner et al., &apos;81), physiological (Maturana et al., '59), and behavioral (Sperry, '44) methods.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Diffuse bipolar cells provide input to OFF parasol ganglion cells in the macaque <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Parasol <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> ganglion cells are more sensitive to luminance contrast and respond more transiently at all levels of adaptation than midget ganglion cells. This may be due, in part, to differences between bipolar cells that provide their input, and the goal of these experiments was to study these differences. Midget bipolar cells are known to be presynaptic to midget ganglion cells. To identify the bipolar cells presynaptic to parasol cells, these ganglion cells were intracellularly injected with Neurobiotin, cone bipolar cells were immunolabeled, and the double-labeled material was analyzed. In the electron microscope, we found that DB3 diffuse bipolar cells labeled by using antiserum to calbindin D-28k were presynaptic to OFF parasol cells. In the confocal microscope, DB3 bipolars costratified with OFF parasol cell dendrites and made significantly more appositions with them than expected due to chance. Flat midget bipolar cells were labeled with antiserum to recoverin. Although they made a few appositions with parasol cells, the number was no greater than would be expected when two sets of processes have overlapping distributions in the inner plexiform layer. DB2 diffuse bipolar cells were labeled with antibodies to excitatory amino acid transporter 2, and they also made appositions with OFF parasol cells. These results suggest that DB2 bipolar cells are also presynaptic to OFF parasol ganglion cells, but midget bipolar cells are not. We estimate that midperipheral OFF parasol cells receive approximately 500 synapses from 50 DB3 bipolar cells that, in turn, receive input from 250 cones.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>A Golgi and ultrastructural analysis of the <BrainRegion>centromedian nucleus</BrainRegion> of the cat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The morphology of neurons in the <BrainRegion>centromedian nucleus</BrainRegion> (CM) was studied in rapid Golgi preparations of the adult cat. The ultrastructure of the nucleus, particularly its synaptic organization, was also studied with electron microscopy. The <BrainRegion>centromedian nucleus</BrainRegion>(CM) contains three types of neurons referred to as principal neurons, Golgi type II neurons, and bushy neurons. Principal neurons are the most numerous, have long dendrites, which branch infrequently, and are divided into two subgroups: principal-A neurons with dendrites that arborize radially, whereas principal-B neurons display horizontal orientations. Both subgroups show a frontal orientation in their dendritic organization and give rise to myelinated axons. Golgi type II neurons with their characteristic sinuous dendrites and unmyelinated axons are thought to be interneurons. The occurrence of bushy neurons in the cat&apos;s <BrainRegion>centromedian nucleus</BrainRegion>(CM) is a new finding. These bushy neurons resemble those of <BrainRegion>thalamic specific relay nuclei</BrainRegion> and give rise to myelinated axons. In addition to these three cell types, neurons with intermediate features between these three neuronal types are also described. The ultrastructure of <BrainRegion>centromedian nucleus</BrainRegion>(CM) neurons resembles, in general, typical central nervous system neurons. Presynaptic profiles are classified into four main categories. SR (small round) boutons are small in size, contain clear, round vesicles, and form asymmetrical synaptic contacts with predominantly small-diameter dendrites. LR (large round) boutons are relatively large and contain both clear and dense-cored vesicles. They interdigitate and form multiple, moderately asymmetrical synapses with their postsynaptic targets. Pale profiles are identified by their relatively electron-light appearance. They contain round vesicles and are thought to be dendritic in origin. The last category of presynaptic profiles is pleomorphic boutons. They contain vesicles of different shapes and are further subdivided into two subtypes: pleomorphic-I ends on soma and dendritic trunks, whereas pleomorphic-II contacts small-diameter dendrites. Both subtypes form symmetrical synapses. The glomeruli of <BrainRegion>specific thalamic relay nuclei</BrainRegion> generally contain dendrites, large round(LR) boutons, and pale profiles. In addition to these, pleomorphic-II boutons also participate in the formation of the glomerulus of the cat&apos;s <BrainRegion>centromedian nucleus</BrainRegion>(CM) .</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Colocalization of gamma-aminobutyric acid with vasopressin, vasoactive intestinal peptide, and somatostatin in the rat <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The seemingly contradictory observations in previous publications that gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is detected in all cell bodies of the <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion> (SCN) and that terminals originating from the <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion>(SCN) are only 20-30% gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) positive prompted us to investigate whether this might be explained by a preference of colocalization in terminals of certain peptidergic neurons in the <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion>(SCN) or by a day/night rhythm in gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) synthesis. At three different circadian times, animals were perfusion fixed, and their <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion>(SCN) s were stained for vasopressin (VP), somatostatin (SOM), or vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP). Subsequently, the number of gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) peptide-positive terminals was determined using gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) postembedding staining in ultrathin sections. It appeared that the highest percentage of colocalization with gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) was detected in vasoactive intestinal polypeptide(VIP) terminals (38%) and the lowest in vasopressin(VP) terminals (15%). No differences in colocalization percentages could be observed in any parameter at any circadian time. In the <BrainRegion>dorsomedial hypothalamus</BrainRegion>, one of the target areas of the vasopressin(VP) and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide(VIP) fibers from the <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion>(SCN) , a colocalization of gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) within vasopressin(VP) and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide(VIP) terminals was found similar to that in the <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion>(SCN) . In the region of the somatostatin-containing neurons in the <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion>(SCN) , a number of axoaxonal contacts could be observed that sometimes exhibited synaptic specializations. In nearly all cases, the axoaxonic terminals contained gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) and/or somatostatin(SOM) . The conclusion is that the high level of intrinsic gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) ergic connections in the <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion>(SCN) represents a putatively powerful mechanism to synchronize or shut down the activity of the <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion>(SCN) . We discuss the possibility that, depending on the firing frequency of the neurons, the colocalization of gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) with all peptides under investigation allows for the selection of which transmitter is released, the peptidergic one or the amino acid.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Dual olfactory pathway in the honeybee, Apis mellifera.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The <BrainRegion>antennal lobes</BrainRegion> (ALs) are the <BrainRegion>primary olfactory centers</BrainRegion> in the insect brain. In the <BrainRegion>AL</BrainRegion> of the honeybee, <BrainRegion>olfactory glomeruli</BrainRegion> receive input via four antennal sensory tracts (<BrainRegion>T1-4</BrainRegion>). Axons of projection neurons (PNs) leave the <BrainRegion>AL</BrainRegion> via several antenno-cerebral tracts (ACTs). To assign the input-output connectivity of all glomeruli, we investigated the spatial relationship of the antennal tracts and two prominent <BrainRegion>AL</BrainRegion> output tracts (<BrainRegion>medial and lateral ACT</BrainRegion>) mainly formed by uniglomerular (u) projection neurons(PNs) using fluorescent tracing, confocal microscopy, and 3D analyses. Furthermore, we investigated the projections of all antenno-cerebral tracts(ACTs) in higher <BrainRegion>olfactory centers</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>mushroom-bodies</BrainRegion> (MB) and <BrainRegion>lateral horn</BrainRegion> (LH). The results revealed a clear segregation of glomeruli into two <BrainRegion>AL hemispheres</BrainRegion> specifically supplied by projection neurons(PNs) of the <BrainRegion>medial and lateral ACT</BrainRegion>. projection neurons(PNs) of the <BrainRegion>lateral ACT</BrainRegion> innervate glomeruli in the <BrainRegion>ventral-rostral AL</BrainRegion> and primarily receive input from <BrainRegion>T1</BrainRegion> (plus a few glomeruli from <BrainRegion>T2 and T3</BrainRegion>). projection neurons(PNs) of the <BrainRegion>medial ACT</BrainRegion> innervate glomeruli in the <BrainRegion>dorsal-caudal hemisphere</BrainRegion>, and mainly receive input from <BrainRegion>T3</BrainRegion> (plus a few glomeruli from <BrainRegion>T2 and T4</BrainRegion>). The projection neurons(PNs) of the <BrainRegion>m- and l-ACT</BrainRegion> terminate in different areas of the <BrainRegion>mushroom-bodies(MB) calyx</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>lateral horn</BrainRegion>(LH) and remain largely segregated. Tracing of three mediolateral (ml) antenno-cerebral tracts(ACTs) mainly formed by multiglomerular projection neurons(PNs) revealed terminals in distinct compartments of the <BrainRegion>lateral horn</BrainRegion>(LH) and in three <BrainRegion>olfactory foci within the lateral protocerebrum</BrainRegion>. The results indicate that <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> input in the honeybee is processed via two separate, mainly uPN pathways to the <BrainRegion>mushroom-bodies(MB) calyx</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>lateral horn</BrainRegion>(LH) and several pathways to the <BrainRegion>lateral protocerebrum</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Quantitative analysis of the columnar arrangement of neurons in the human <BrainRegion>cingulate cortex</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The spatial organization of human <BrainRegion>cingulate</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>areas 24b, 23b, and 31</BrainRegion>) and <BrainRegion>pericingulate</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>areas 7 and 19</BrainRegion>) <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion> was examined by using an image analyzer to measure characteristics of vertically oriented, translaminar columns of neurons in the <BrainRegion>cerebral cortex</BrainRegion>. Columns of 30-50 microns in diameter are hypothesized to be a general feature of <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> organization, but no quantitative analysis of different human <BrainRegion>cortical areas</BrainRegion> has been performed. Our results prove for the first time that a columnar organization was detectable in every area examined. The average width of cell columns was approximately 40 microns separated by a neuropil-rich fascicle of the same dimension. Because differences in the expression of a columnar organization were seen, the degree of columnization was subsequently expressed by a verticality index (VI) revealing specific changes in its dimension depending on the architectonic area. The verticality index(VI) was calculated by a linear combination of three variables derived from the measurement of cell density profiles in Nissl-stained sections at right angles to vertically oriented cell columns. Variables included the amplitude of profile peaks, the standard deviation of the width of those profile peaks, and the standard deviation of the distances between profile peaks. The index of verticality describes the deviation of a distinct area and layer from the mean degree of vertical organization of all <BrainRegion>cortical areas</BrainRegion> and layers examined. Thus, different degrees of columnar organization can be quantitatively described by the verticality index and can be used as criteria to characterize architectonic areas.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Lumbar lateral motor column</BrainRegion> development in triploid Xenopus laevis.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The effects of increasing ploidy on the development of the <BrainRegion>lumbar lateral motor column</BrainRegion> (L-LMC) in Xenopus laevis were investigated in order to determine how early events contribute to producing the significant difference in the average number of motoneurons present in diploid and triploid animals after cell death (Sperry: J. Comp. Neurol. 277:499-508, &apos;88). From naturally occurring diploid and experimentally produced triploid siblings at two stages prior to significant amounts of neuronal cell death, at one stage during the peak period of cell death, and at one stage after cell death, the <BrainRegion>lateral motor column</BrainRegion>(L-LMC) motoneurons were counted and nuclear cross-sectional areas were measured. At stages before and after cell death, the average nuclear cross-sectional areas of motoneurons and of other cells that were also measured were greater in the triploids, while the average number of motoneurons and motoneuron density (the mean number of cells per section) were less. Average body size and average motor column length in diploid and triploid animals were equal at each of the stages. The general characteristics of <BrainRegion>lateral motor column</BrainRegion>(L-LMC) development that have been widely noted in diploids, an increase in cell size accompanied by a decrease in cell number, were also observed in the triploid animals. However, not only were these general features present in the triploids, but the increase in average motoneuron size and the decrease in average motoneuron number in diploids and triploids were roughly equal when scaled to the general differences in nuclear size or to the difference in the average number of motoneurons present prior to cell death.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Quantitative analysis of the number and distribution of neurons richly innervated by GABA-immunoreactive axons in the rat superior cervical ganglion.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The superior cervical ganglion of rats contains a considerable number of nerve fibers with GABA-like immunoreactivity which show a nonuniform distribution within the ganglion. The topography of these fibers has been analyzed by using antibodies raised against GABA-BSA-glutaraldehyde complexes. GABA-positive axons and axon varicosities accumulated around a subpopulation of principal ganglion cells forming basketlike patterns. These neurons richly innervated by GABA-positive axons (RIG-neurons) in turn were aggregated in patches with strong immunoreactivity. The size and packing density of the patches containing RIG-neurons and GABA-positive axons approaching them had rostral-to-caudal and medial-to-lateral gradients. Similar patterns were found in right and left ganglia. In five ganglia, a quantitative analysis revealed on average 1,344 RIG-neurons per ganglion representing about 5% of the total neuron population, with small variations (standard deviation 122) despite the highly variable shape of the ganglia. The distribution of RIG-neurons resembles that of neurons sending their axons into the internal carotid nerve. To check this possible correlation, HRP was injected into the eye and applied to the transected external carotid nerve. Double staining for the retrogradely transported peroxidase and GABA immunohistochemistry revealed that RIG-neurons formed a small subpopulation of retrogradely labelled neurons in both experiments. This suggests that RIG-neurons innervate various target organs. This conclusion is in agreement with the observation that RIG-neurons also exist in other sympathetic ganglia. Data presented suggest that sympathetic ganglion cells can be classified on the basis of non-uniform innervation patterns formed by axons that use different neurotransmitters.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Mushroom bodies</BrainRegion> of the cockroach: activity and identities of neurons recorded in freely moving animals.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>This article describes novel attributes of the <BrainRegion>mushroom bodies</BrainRegion> of cockroaches revealed by recording from neurons in freely moving insects. The results suggest several hitherto unrecognized functions of the <BrainRegion>mushroom bodies</BrainRegion>: extrinsic neurons that discriminate between imposed and self-generated sensory stimulation, extrinsic neurons that monitor motor actions, and a third class of extrinsic neurons that predict episodes of locomotion and modulate their activity depending on the turning direction. Electrophysiological units have been correlated with neurons that were partially stained by uptake of copper ions and silver intensification. Neurons so revealed correspond to Golgi-impregnated or Lucifer yellow-filled neurons and demonstrate that their processes generally ascend to other areas of the <BrainRegion>protocerebrum</BrainRegion>. The present results support the idea of multiple roles for the <BrainRegion>mushroom bodies</BrainRegion>. These include sensory discrimination, the integration of sensory perception with motor actions, and, as described in the companion article, a role in place memory.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Cytochrome oxidase staining marks dendritic zones of the rat <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> external plexiform layer.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Cytochrome oxidase staining of the rat <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> external plexiform layer (EPL) produces a darkly stained intermediate zone bordered by lightly stained superficial and deep zones. Similar zonal staining was seen in cats, rabbits, and hamsters. These zones vary in relative thickness around the circumference of the <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>; the deep zone is proportionally thicker in the most <BrainRegion>dorsal and ventral parts of the bulb</BrainRegion>. Tufted cell somata are unevenly distributed within the external plexiform layer(EPL) ; the outer part of the external plexiform layer(EPL) has more somata. The distribution of the cytochrome oxidase reaction product shows that the darkly stained intermediate zone is not produced by staining of tufted cell somata. Zones of cytochrome oxidase staining correspond to the sublaminar distribution of mitral and tufted cell basal dendrites. This was demonstrated by labeling mitral and tufted cells with small extracellular horseradish peroxidase injections and processing alternate sections for horseradish peroxidase and for cytochrome oxidase. Because there was cross-reaction of the cytochrome oxidase procedure with horseradish peroxidase, it was possible to trace many neurons through both series of sections. Middle tufted cells of the superficial external plexiform layer(EPL) have basal dendrites confined to the superficial zone of light cytochrome oxidase staining. Internal tufted cells and middle tufted cells of the intermediate zone send their basal dendrites into the intermediate zone. One group of mitral cells (type I) has basal dendrites confined to the deep zone of lighter cytochrome oxidase staining. A second group of mitral cells (type II) and tufted cells of the intermediate external plexiform layer(EPL) has basal dendrites primarily confined to the intermediate zone of dark cytochrome oxidase staining. The correlation of the enzyme staining with the dendritic laminar patterns supports the existence of three relatively distinct sublaminae in the external plexiform layer(EPL) and supports the designation of two types of mitral cells. The staining pattern also provides an independent method for evaluating the sublaminae of the external plexiform layer(EPL) without the necessity of labeling individual groups of cells. Finally, the staining pattern suggests that the intermediate zone of the external plexiform layer(EPL) may be subjected to more tonic synaptic input, causing it to have an increased level of metabolic activity.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>The <BrainRegion>primate mediodorsal (MD) nucleus</BrainRegion> and its projection to the <BrainRegion>frontal lobe</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The <BrainRegion>frontal lobe</BrainRegion> projections of the <BrainRegion>mediodorsal (MD) nucleus</BrainRegion> of the <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion> were examined in rhesus monkey by transport of retrograde markers injected into one of nine cytoarchitectonic regions (<BrainRegion>Walker&apos;s areas 6, 8A, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 46</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>Brodmann&apos;s area 4</BrainRegion>) located in the <BrainRegion>rostral third of the cerebrum</BrainRegion>. Each area of <BrainRegion>prefrontal, premotor, or motor cortex</BrainRegion> injected was found to receive a topographically unique <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> input from clusters of cells in specific subdivisions within <BrainRegion>mediodorsal</BrainRegion>(MD) . All of the <BrainRegion>prefrontal areas</BrainRegion> examined also receive topographically organized inputs from other <BrainRegion>thalamic nuclei</BrainRegion> including, most prominently, the <BrainRegion>ventral anterior (VA) and medial pulvinar nuclei</BrainRegion>. Conversely, and in agreement with previous findings, <BrainRegion>mediodorsal</BrainRegion>(MD) projects to areas of the <BrainRegion>frontal lobe</BrainRegion> beyond the traditional borders of <BrainRegion>prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion>, such as the <BrainRegion>anterior cingulate</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>supplementary motor cortex</BrainRegion>. The topography of thalamocortical neurons revealed in coronal sections through <BrainRegion>ventral anterior</BrainRegion>(VA) , <BrainRegion>mediodorsal</BrainRegion>(MD) , and <BrainRegion>pulvinar</BrainRegion> is circumferential. In the <BrainRegion>medial part of mediodorsal</BrainRegion>(MD) , for example, thalamocortical neurons shift from a dorsal to a ventral position for <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> targets lying medial to lateral along the ventral surface of the lobe; neurons in the <BrainRegion>lateral mediodorsal</BrainRegion>(MD) move from a ventral to a dorsal position, for <BrainRegion>cortical areas</BrainRegion> situated lateral to medial on the convexity of the hemisphere. The aggregate evidence for topographic specificity is supported further by experiments in which different fluorescent dyes were placed in multiple areas of the <BrainRegion>frontal lobe</BrainRegion> in each of three cases. The results show that very few, if any, <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> neurons project to more than one area of <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion>. The widespread <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> targets of <BrainRegion>mediodorsal</BrainRegion>(MD) neurons together with evidence for multiple <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> inputs to <BrainRegion>prefrontal areas</BrainRegion> support a revision of the classical hodological definition of <BrainRegion>prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion> as the exclusive cortical recipient of <BrainRegion>mediodorsal</BrainRegion>(MD) projections. Rather, the <BrainRegion>prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion> is defined by multiple specific relationships with the <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Age-related increase in the total number of corticotropin-releasing hormone neurons in the human <BrainRegion>paraventricular nucleus</BrainRegion> in controls and Alzheimer&apos;s disease: comparison of the disector with an unfolding method.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>It has been hypothesized that the corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neurons of the <BrainRegion>hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus</BrainRegion> (PVN) become hyperactive with age, and even more so in Alzheimer&apos;s disease. This hyperactivity could be due to an increased production of corticotropin-releasing hormone(CRH) per neuron, or an increased number of paraventricular nucleus(PVN) neurons producing corticotropin-releasing hormone(CRH) , or both. As a first step in elucidating which of these biological mechanisms might be operative, we have estimated the absolute number of corticotropin-releasing hormone(CRH) immunoreactive neurons in the <BrainRegion>paraventricular nucleus</BrainRegion>(PVN) of 10 human control subjects between 36 and 91 years of age and 10 Alzheimer patients between 40 and 97 years of age. corticotropin-releasing hormone(CRH) neurons were immunocytochemically detected in 6 microns paraffin sections with the aid of a highly specific monoclonal antibody to corticotropin-releasing hormone(CRH) . The antibody signal was amplified by the biotin-streptavidin and alkaline phosphatase methods. The absolute number of corticotropin-releasing hormone(CRH) neurons in the <BrainRegion>paraventricular nucleus</BrainRegion>(PVN) was obtained by multiplying the number of corticotropin-releasing hormone(CRH) neurons in a unit volume (NV) by the total volume of the <BrainRegion>paraventricular nucleus</BrainRegion>(PVN) . Two different methods were used to estimate the NV: an unfolding method and a disector method (about three times more time-consuming). Compared to the disector, the unfolding method consistently yielded a lower cell number for all patients by 38% (+/- 2.8%; mean +/- SEM). However, both methods yielded an increase in the absolute number of corticotropin-releasing hormone(CRH) neurons in control and Alzheimer patients with age. No statistically significant difference in the absolute number of corticotropin-releasing hormone(CRH) neurons was found between control and Alzheimer patients with both methods. The age-dependent increase in the absolute number of corticotropin-releasing hormone(CRH) neurons within the <BrainRegion>paraventricular nucleus</BrainRegion>(PVN) of both control and Alzheimer patients is interpreted as a sign of activation of the corticotropin-releasing hormone(CRH) neurons with age.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Growth of the corticospinal tract and the development of placing reactions in the postnatal rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The growth of corticospinal axons into the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> has been demonstrated using the autoradiographic and the Fink-Heimer silver degeneration methods. In addition, the development of several types of placing reactions have been studied. After unilateral injections of radioactive proline or unilateral ablations of the <BrainRegion>somatosensory-motor cortex</BrainRegion>, corticospinal axons were found to extend into the contralateral dorsal funiculus of the lower cervical cord at one day postnatally, into mid-thoracic segments at three days, into <BrainRegion>upper lumbar cord</BrainRegion> by five days and into <BrainRegion>coccygeal segments</BrainRegion> by nine days. Corticospinal axons are first present in the <BrainRegion>contralateral spinal gray of lower cervical cord</BrainRegion> at day 5 and in the <BrainRegion>contralateral spinal gray of lower lumbar and sacral cord</BrainRegion> by day 9. Little change in the topographical distribution or in the density of the projection is found at all levels of the spinal gray after the fourteenth postnatal day. Comparable results were found with both experimental techniques. Forelimb placing is first seen between 4 to 7 days and hind limb placing between 9 to 13 days. The last placing response to appear in both the forelimbs and the hindlimbs is placing in response to tactile and light proprioceptive stimuli. After the initial onset of the placing reactions, there is a gradual increase in the frequency and speed of the responses until 14 to 17 days postnatally, at which time the reactions appear to be mature. While a causative relationship between the growth of corticospinal axons into the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> and the development of placing has not been established, a close temporal relationship has been found between first: the appearance of fore-or hindlimb placing responses and the appearance of corticospinal axons within the spinal gray at the appropriate levels of the cord and second: between the completion of the primary growth of corticospinal axons at the light microscopic level and the maturation of the placing reactions.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Direct projections from the <BrainRegion>cardiovascular nucleus tractus solitarii</BrainRegion> to <BrainRegion>pontine</BrainRegion> preganglionic parasympathetic neurons: a link to cerebrovascular regulation.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Peripheral or central interruption of the baroreflex or the parasympathetic innervation of cerebral vessels leads to similar changes in regulation of cerebral blood flow. Therefore, we sought to test the hypothesis that the <BrainRegion>cardiovascular nucleus tractus solitarii</BrainRegion>, the site of termination of arterial baroreceptor nerves, projects to <BrainRegion>pontine</BrainRegion> preganglionic neurons whose stimulation elicits cerebral vasodilatation. The current study utilized both light and electron microscopic techniques to analyze anterograde tracing from the <BrainRegion>cardiovascular nucleus tractus solitarii</BrainRegion> to preganglionic parasympathetic neurons in the pons. We further used retrograde tracing from that same pontine region to the <BrainRegion>cardiovascular nucleus tractus solitarii</BrainRegion> and evaluated the confluence of tracing from the cardiovascular nucleus tractus solitarii to pontine preganglionic neurons labeled retrogradely from the pterygopalatine ganglia. The <BrainRegion>cardiovascular nucleus tractus solitarii</BrainRegion> projected to <BrainRegion>pontine</BrainRegion> preganglionic parasympathetic neurons, but more <BrainRegion>rostral and caudal regions of nucleus tractus solitarii</BrainRegion> did not. In contrast, all three regions of <BrainRegion>nucleus tractus solitarii</BrainRegion> projected to the <BrainRegion>nucleus ambiguus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>dorsal motor nucleus</BrainRegion> of the vagus. Although not projecting to <BrainRegion>pontine</BrainRegion> preganglionic parasympathetic neurons, <BrainRegion>regions lateral, rostral, and caudal to cardiovascular nucleus tractus solitarii</BrainRegion> sent projections through the <BrainRegion>pons medial</BrainRegion> to the preganglionics. The study establishes the presence of a direct monosynaptic pathway from neurons in the <BrainRegion>cardiovascular nucleus tractus solitarii</BrainRegion> to <BrainRegion>pontine</BrainRegion> preganglionic parasympathetic neurons that project to the pterygopalatine ganglia, the source of nitroxidergic vasodilatory innervation of cerebral blood vessels. It provides evidence that activation of those preganglionic neurons can cause cerebral vasodilatation and increased cerebral blood flow. Finally, it demonstrates differential innervation of <BrainRegion>medullary</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>pontine</BrainRegion> preganglionic parasympathetic neurons by different regions of the <BrainRegion>nucleus tractus solitarii</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Upregulation of Kv 1.4 protein and gene expression after chronic <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> injury.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>After <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> injury (SCI), white matter tracts are characterized by demyelination and increased sensitivity to the K(+) channel blocker 4-aminopyridine (4-AP). These effects appear to contribute to neurological impairment after spinal cord injury(SCI) , although the molecular changes in K(+) channel subunit expression remain poorly understood. We examined changes in gene expression of the 4-aminopyridine(4-AP) -sensitive voltage-gated K(+) channel Kv 1.4 after chronic spinal cord injury(SCI) in the rat. Quantitative immunoblotting showed that Kv 1.4 protein was significantly increased at 6 weeks, but not at 1 week, after <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> injury(SCI) in <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> white matter. Kv 1.4 was localized to astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and oligodendrocyte progenitor cells but not to axons in both the normal and the injured <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> white matter. Because glial cells proliferate after <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> injury(SCI) , we used immunogold electron microscopy to quantify Kv 1.4 protein in individual glial cells and found a sixfold increase of Kv 1.4 in cells of the oligodendrocyte lineage after chronic injury. Finally, quantitative in situ hybridization showed that Kv 1.4 mRNA was significantly upregulated in <BrainRegion>spinal cord white matter</BrainRegion>, but not gray matter, after <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> injury(SCI) . In summary, we show that Kv 1.4 is expressed in glial cells and not in axons in the rat <BrainRegion>spinal cord white matter</BrainRegion> and that its expression is markedly increased in cells of the oligodendrocyte lineage after chronic <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> injury(SCI) . Given that K(+) channels play a role in glial cell proliferation, cells exhibiting changes in Kv 1.4 expression may represent proliferating oligodendroglia in the chronically injured <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Adrenaline-synthesizing neurons in the <BrainRegion>medulla</BrainRegion> of the cat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>In this study, the distribution of neurons containing the adrenaline-synthesizing enzyme phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase (PNMT) was mapped in the <BrainRegion>medulla</BrainRegion> of the cat. Data from recent studies in the rat suggest that the anatomical structure responsible for cardiorespiratory changes that occur following application of neurotransmitters and drugs to <BrainRegion>Schlaefke&apos;s area</BrainRegion> on the <BrainRegion>ventral medullary surface</BrainRegion> is the <BrainRegion>nucleus reticularis rostroventrolateralis</BrainRegion> (RVL), which is distinguished from adjacent regions of the <BrainRegion>reticular formation</BrainRegion>, in part, by the presence of adrenaline-synthesizing neurons. To determine whether an equivalent adrenergic population is present in the <BrainRegion>rostroventrolateralis</BrainRegion>(RVL) of the cat, we used antibodies raised against bovine adrenal phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase(PNMT) to map the distribution of adrenaline-synthesizing neurons in the <BrainRegion>reticular formation</BrainRegion>. In the <BrainRegion>ventrolateral medulla</BrainRegion>, we found that labeled cells extended from the level of the <BrainRegion>retrofacial nucleus</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>calamus scriptorius</BrainRegion>. The majority of labeled cells were seen in a nucleus designated <BrainRegion>rostroventrolateralis</BrainRegion>(RVL) at the level of the <BrainRegion>rostral one-third of the inferior olive</BrainRegion>. In the <BrainRegion>dorsomedial medulla</BrainRegion>, cells were labeled in the <BrainRegion>caudal aspect of the nucleus tractus solitarii</BrainRegion> (NTS) and were especially dense in the <BrainRegion>subnucleus gelatinosus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>commissural nucleus of the vagus</BrainRegion>. A few lightly labeled cells were also present in the <BrainRegion>rostral pole of the area postrema</BrainRegion> (AP). In contrast to the rat, few or no immunoreactive cells were found in the <BrainRegion>rostral nucleus tractus solitarii</BrainRegion>(NTS) , medial longitudinal fasciculus, <BrainRegion>nucleus paragigantocellularis dorsalis</BrainRegion>, or <BrainRegion>periventricular gray</BrainRegion>. Our results are consistent with the notion that an area of the <BrainRegion>rostroventrolateralis</BrainRegion>(RVL) containing adrenergic perikarya is the anatomical structure responsible for cardiovascular changes that occur when chemicals are applied to <BrainRegion>Schlaefke&apos;s area</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Physiological identification and analysis of <BrainRegion>dentate</BrainRegion> granule cell responses to stimulation of the medial and lateral perforant pathways in the rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Stimulation of the dorsomedial or ventrolateral perforant pathways resulted in quantitatively different extracellularly recorded EPSPs in the <BrainRegion>fascia dentata</BrainRegion> of the rat. The two potentials differed in latency to peak and in width at half amplitude in a manner consistent with the different locus of termination of the two pathways on the granule cell dendrites. Both potentials were able to follow brief stimulus trains of 100 Hz, which suggests that they are monosynaptic. Medially elicited responses had their peak negativity approximately 100 to 180 micrometer deeper in the molecular layer than laterally elicited responses. Stimulation at short intervals along a dorsomedial to ventrolateral track in the angular bundle yielded a step function rather than a continuum of EPSP peak latency and half-width, in agreement with Hjorth-Simonsen&apos;s ('72) evidence for the separateness of the two pathways. Both pathways were able to induce granule cell discharge. Laterally elicited spikes, however, were delayed. Stimulation at intermediate locations frequently elicited double spikes from the granule cell population. Population spikes elicited by either pathway were inhibited for as long as 100 msec after a single discharge. Both pathways showed facilitation with double stimuli at short intervals, and both showed post-tetanic potentiation lasting at least 30 minutes. Under conditions where it could be shown that the two pathways at least partially converged onto the same granule cells, the response of one pathway did not increase when long lasting potentiation was induced on the other.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Ultrastructural change at rat cerebellothalamic synapses associated with volitional motor adaptation.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Our ability to develop or modify motor skills is thought to involve persistent changes in the efficacy of synaptic transmission (synaptic plasticity) in the <BrainRegion>cerebellum</BrainRegion>. Previous work from our laboratory and others, examining synapses between neurons in the <BrainRegion>deep cerebellar nuclei</BrainRegion> and neurons in the <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion> revealed ultrastructural characteristics that have been implicated in the expression of synaptic plasticity at other locations in the brain. The present study sought evidence of ultrastructural plasticity at cerebellothalamic synapses associated with volitional motor adaptation. Adult rats were subject to 21 days of training, throughout which a novel load (overcome by predominantly shoulder adduction) was applied to the left forelimb while they fed (the right forelimb acted as an internal control). The behavioral paradigm was observed to produce a profound unilateral motor adaptation that was complete by day 15. Three days before the end of training, intracortical microstimulation was performed to identify the regions of <BrainRegion>primary motor cortex</BrainRegion> responsible for execution of shoulder adduction movements on the experimental (right) and control (left) sides of the brain. A retrograde neuronal tracer was injected into these <BrainRegion>cortical regions</BrainRegion> and the animals were returned to the training cage. Following training, small blocks of <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> tissue containing retrogradely labeled cells were removed from the brains for ultrastructural analyses of presumed cerebellothalamic synapses (see Materials and Methods section). The only ultrastructural change observed to occur in association with the volitional motor adaptation was an increase in the proportion of dendritic shaft active zone with docked synaptic vesicles.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>SMN, the product of the <BrainRegion>spinal</BrainRegion> muscular atrophy-determining gene, is expressed widely but selectively in the developing human <BrainRegion>forebrain</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The expression pattern of the survival motor neuron (SMN) protein has been investigated immunohistochemically in the human fetal <BrainRegion>forebrain</BrainRegion> from 14 to 38 weeks of gestation. Mutations in the survival motor neuron(SMN) gene cause <BrainRegion>spinal</BrainRegion> muscular atrophy (SMA), an autosomal recessive disease characterized by degeneration of lower motor neurons in the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> leading to progressive muscle wasting. survival motor neuron(SMN) is a multifunctional protein and has been implicated in diverse cytoplasmic and nuclear processes. The monoclonal murine survival motor neuron(SMN) antibody used in this study recognized a major band at approximately 34 kDa. In <BrainRegion>spinal cord anterior horn</BrainRegion> motor neurons at 13 weeks of gestation, the soma, proximal neurites, and nucleus were immunostained. In the nucleus, survival motor neuron(SMN) immunolabeling was observed at the nuclear membrane, at the nucleolus, and at dot-like structures in the nucleoplasm likely to be coiled bodies and gems. In the fetal <BrainRegion>forebrain</BrainRegion>, survival motor neuron(SMN) was immunodetected as early as 14 weeks of gestation. From 14 to 24 weeks of gestation, intense immunostaining was observed in the basal nucleus of Meynert, a major source of cholinergic afferents to the <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion>. Less intensely labeled cells at lower packing density were also observed in the <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>reticular and perireticular nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>globus pallidus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>amygdala</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>enthorinal cortex</BrainRegion>. Immunolabeled cells were still detectable at 38 gestational weeks, the latest time point investigated. These findings provide an anatomical basis for future investigations of survival motor neuron(SMN) functions during brain development and for the neuropathological characterization of severe spinal muscular atrophy(SMA) cases.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Anatomical and neurochemical definition of the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the stria terminalis</BrainRegion> in Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica).</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>This study in birds provides anatomical, immunohistochemical, and hodological data on a <BrainRegion>prosencephalic region</BrainRegion> in which the nomenclature is still a matter of discussion. In quail, this region is located just dorsal to the <BrainRegion>anterior commissure</BrainRegion> and extends from the level of the <BrainRegion>medial part of the preoptic area</BrainRegion> at its most rostral end to the caudal aspects of the <BrainRegion>nucleus preopticus medialis</BrainRegion>. At this caudal level, it reaches its maximal elongation and extends from the ventral tip of the <BrainRegion>lateral ventricles</BrainRegion> to the dorsolateral aspects of the <BrainRegion>paraventricular nucleus</BrainRegion>. This area contains aromatase-immunoreactive cells and a sexually dimorphic population of small, vasotocinergic neurons. The Nissl staining of adjacent sections revealed the presence of a cluster of intensely stained cells outlining the same region delineated by the vasotocin-immunoreactive structures. Cytoarchitectonic, immunohistochemical, and in situ hybridization data support the notion that this area is similar and is probably homologous to the <BrainRegion>medial part of the nucleus of the stria terminalis</BrainRegion> of the mammalian brain. The present data provide a clear definition of this nucleus in quail: They show for the first time the presence of sexually dimorphic vasotocinergic neurons in this region of the quail brain and provide the first detailed description of this region in an avian species.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Spatiotemporal pattern of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-diaphorase reactivity in the developing central nervous system of premetamorphic Xenopus laevis tadpoles.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>We have catalogued the progressive appearance of putative nitric oxide synthase (NOS)-containing neurons in the developing central nervous system (CNS) of Xenopus laevis. Xenopus embryos and larvae were processed in wholemount and in cross section using nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-diaphorase (NADPH-d) histochemistry as a marker for nitric oxide synthase(NOS) within the central nervous system(CNS) . The temporal sequence of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-diaphorase(NADPH-d) reactivity identified discrete groups and subgroups of neurons in the <BrainRegion>forebrain</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>midbrain</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>hindbrain</BrainRegion> on the basis of their morphology, location, and order of appearance during development. A proportion of these groups of neurons appeared to be important in sensory processing and motor control. Staining also appeared at specific stages in the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>, and the skin. After the appearance of labelling, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-diaphorase(NADPH-d) reactivity continued in each of the cell groups throughout the stages examined. We found no evidence for staining that subsequently disappeared at later stages in any cell group, indicating a persistent rather than transient role for NO in the Xenopus tadpole central nervous system(CNS) . These results are discussed in light of recent findings on possible roles for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-diaphorase(NADPH-d) -positive cell groups within the developing motor circuitry.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Sex differences in the pattern of steroid accumulation by motoneurons of the rat <BrainRegion>lumbar spinal cord</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>We previously reported that male rat lumbar motoneurons accumulate radioactivity after injection of tritiated testosterone (T) or dihydrotestosterone (DHT), but not estradiol (E). We now report autoradiographic evidence that lumbar motoneurons in male rats accumulate T or its metabolites more frequently than do female motoneurons. However, this sex difference in hormone accumulation by motoneurons is not observed following the injection of dihydrotestosterone(DHT) or E, both of which are normal metabolites of T. Very few motoneurons from any population accumulated E or its metabolites. In fact, some motoneurons had fewer silver grains over their nuclei than would be expected by chance, thus suggesting that these cells not only failed to accumulate E or its metabolites, but actively or passively excluded them from their nuclei. Virtually every motoneuron of either sex accumulated hormone after dihydrotestosterone(DHT) injection. Following T injection, more motoneurons were labeled in males (72-77%) than in females (28-39%), indicating a sex difference in hormone accumulation. Taken together, these results suggest that either (1) there are separate receptors for T and dihydrotestosterone(DHT) , and motoneurons have more T receptors (but equal numbers of dihydrotestosterone(DHT) receptors) in males than in females, or (2) the motoneurons of male rats have greater access to systemically administered T or its metabolites than do those of females.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Postnatal development of tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactive amacrine cells in the rabbit retina: I. Morphological characterization.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The present and accompanying (Casini, G., and N.C. Brecha, J. Comp. Neurol. 326:302-313, 1992) papers investigate the postnatal development of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-immunoreactive (IR) amacrine cells in the rabbit <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>. This study is focused on a detailed analysis of the patterns of cellular growth and differentiation of tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) - -immunoreactive(IR) amacrine cells, which serve as a model to gain insights into the mechanisms underlying developmental changes associated with the maturation of amacrine cells. Faintly staining tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) - -immunoreactive(IR) neurons are present in the proximal inner nuclear layer of newborn <BrainRegion>retinas</BrainRegion>. They are characterized by a large nucleus and usually a single primary process lacking varicosities. At postnatal day (PND) 6, tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) - -immunoreactive(IR) processes display more complex morphological characteristics, including a few varicosities, and second- and third-order ramifications. Growth cones are often seen. At postnatal day(PND) s 10 and 12 (eye opening), tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) - -immunoreactive(IR) cells have general morphological characteristics similar to adult tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) - -immunoreactive(IR) amacrines. They display 2-5 primary processes, which start forming a complex network of fibers in lamina 1 of the inner plexiform layer (IPL). tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) - -immunoreactive(IR) processes are also present in lamina 3 and rarely in lamina 5 of the inner plexiform layer(IPL) . Many fibers ending in growth cones are observed. In addition, very rare, thin tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) - -immunoreactive(IR) fibers are present in the outer plexiform layer. At postnatal day(PND) 19, tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) - -immunoreactive(IR) fibers form a complex, dense network in lamina 1 of the inner plexiform layer(IPL) , and loose networks in laminae 3 and 5. Growth cones are not observed at this age. At postnatal day(PND) 26, a few &quot;ring-like" structures formed by tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) - -immunoreactive(IR) fibers in lamina 1 of the inner plexiform layer(IPL) are observed for the first time. In adult <BrainRegion>retinas</BrainRegion>, the &quot;ring-like" structures are more numerous than at postnatal day(PND) 26. A second, rare type of tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) - -immunoreactive(IR) cell ("type B") is encountered in all <BrainRegion>retinal regions</BrainRegion> beginning at postnatal day(PND) 10. These cells are characterized by weak immunostaining and a small soma size. The present findings show that a significant differentiation of tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) - -immunoreactive(IR) neurons occurs during the first 10-12 postnatal day(PND) s. Eye opening is an important period for the maturation of tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) - -immunoreactive(IR) amacrines and, more generally, for the maturation of the inner plexiform layer(IPL) .</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Model of <BrainRegion>forebrain</BrainRegion> regionalization based on spatiotemporal patterns of POU-III homeobox gene expression, birthdates, and morphological features.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>In situ hybridization was used to map spatiotemporal expression patterns of the four known intronless POU-III transcription factor genes Brn-1, Brn-2, Brn-4, and Tst-1 in the developing rat forebrain vesicle, beginning on embryonic day 10. The results indicate that the proliferation layers (ventricular and subventricular) and mantle layer of the <BrainRegion>forebrain neural tube</BrainRegion> each display a strikingly unique pattern of regionalized POU-III expression. Within a particular region, or layer within a region, none to all four of the mRNAs may be detected, and during development a particular mRNA in a particular region displays one of five expression patterns, or a combination of these patterns, which may be described as conserved, lost, transient, acquired, or redeployed expression. In the developing brain as a whole, Brn-1 and Brn-2 early on display somewhat different spatial expression patterns that converge to essential identity in the adult, whereas Brn-4 expression is initially broad and becomes much more restricted in the adult, and Tst-1 expression expands greatly through development. Usually, though not always, expression patterns tend to correlate with major histological features in the <BrainRegion>forebrain</BrainRegion> (often internal or external sulci associated with proliferation zones), and little evidence for waves of expression moving through the whole <BrainRegion>forebrain</BrainRegion> over time was obtained. Thus, clear differences in hybridization intensity often are observed between the <BrainRegion>cerebral cortex</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>basal telencephalic nuclei</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>ventral thalamus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>dorsal thalamus</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>pretectal region</BrainRegion>. In contrast, transverse bands of hybridization extending from the roof to the floor of the <BrainRegion>forebrain</BrainRegion>, corresponding to proposed neuromeres, were not observed with these probes. The results suggest that POU-III transcription factors help define specific regions in the early neuroepithelium as well as different cellular phenotypes in the ventricular, subventricular, and mantle layers of specific regions later in development. Thus, the functions of these regulatory proteins may be different in proliferating neuroepithelial cells, young neurons, and mature neurons and appear to be region-specific.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Development of neuropeptide Y (NPY) immunoreactive neurons in the rat <BrainRegion>occipital cortex</BrainRegion>: a combined immunohistochemical-autoradiographic study.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The postnatal development of neuropeptide Y (NPY)-immunoreactive neurons, previously labeled with [3H]thymidine on embryonic days E14-E21, has been studied in the rat <BrainRegion>occipital cortex</BrainRegion>. Immunohistochemistry combined with autoradiography showed evidence of a modified &quot;inside-out" pattern of maturation. neuropeptide Y(NPY) -neurons are generated between E14 and E20 and are found in layers II-VI of the <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>subcortical white matter</BrainRegion>. neuropeptide Y(NPY) neurons from all these birthdates are overproduced at first, although cells generated at E16 produce the greatest excess, followed by E15 and E17. Some of these transient neurons are found in the &quot;wrong" layer for their birthdates, and their elimination produces a more "correct" alignment at maturity. However, most of the neuropeptide Y(NPY) neurons that survive are generated at E17, and these cells are found throughout layers II-VI with a preponderance in layer VI. This evidence is strongly suggestive of cell death rather than merely cessation of production of neuropeptide Y(NPY) .</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Effects of hydroxyurea parallel the effects of radiation in developing <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> glomeruli in insects.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Previous observations (Oland and Tolbert: J. Comp. Neurol. 255:196-207, &apos;87, Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 13:1144, '87; Oland et al.: J. Neurosci. 8:353-367, '88) have provided evidence that the afferent-axon-induced development of synaptic glomeruli in the <BrainRegion>antennal lobe</BrainRegion> of the moth Manduca sexta depends upon an interaction between ingrowing sensory axons and the glial cells of the <BrainRegion>antennal lobe</BrainRegion>. In order to differentiate between the roles of glial cells and of afferent axons on the partitioning of the lobe into glomeruli, we have used the antimitotic agent hydroxyurea to produce lobes deficient in glial cells but retaining sensory input. The resulting lobes were analyzed in the light and electron microscopes, and the integrity of their antennal input was evaluated by examining the gross and microscopic structure of the antennae, the number of antennal afferent axons, and electroantennogram responses to odors. Our results with hydroxyurea show that in treated animals with adequate antennal input the degree to which the <BrainRegion>antennal-lobe</BrainRegion> neuropil becomes glomerular varies with the number of glial cells remaining in the lobe; when less than approximately one-quarter of the normal glial complement is present, glomeruli do not develop at all. These experiments complement and extend previous experiments in which the number of glial cells was reduced with radiation (Oland et al.: J. Neurosci. 8:353-367, &apos;88). The fact that the present results mimic the previous results with radiation strongly suggest that glial cells do mediate the afferent-axon-induced formation of olfactory glomeruli in the moth.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Local <BrainRegion>cerebral</BrainRegion> glucose consumption in the rat. I. Effects of halothane anesthesia.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Rates of <BrainRegion>cerebral</BrainRegion> glucose utilization were measured by means of the autoradiographic 2-deoxy-D-(1-14C)glucose technique in normal rats under light halothane-anesthesia. Three types of region-specific metabolic alterations were elicited by inhalation of 0.5% halothane. The most striking effect observed was a significant increase of glucose consumption within the <BrainRegion>locus coeruleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>substantia nigra compacta and reticulata</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>interpeduncular nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>fornix</BrainRegion> of the anesthetized animals in comparison to the corresponding brain areas of the conscious control rats. Halothane-anesthesia was also associated with significant metabolic depression in 21 (out of the 74 examined) discrete regions of the rat brain, distributed within the <BrainRegion>pons</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>cerebellum</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>diencephalon</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion>, and was more prevalent in <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>neocortex</BrainRegion>. However, halothane failed to alter consistently the rates of glucose utilization in the rest of the rat brain areas investigated. The present findings suggest that halothane specifically alters the regional <BrainRegion>cerebral</BrainRegion> glucose utilization, with some <BrainRegion>limbic system</BrainRegion> components and the <BrainRegion>basal ganglia</BrainRegion> displaying increased metabolism, in contrast to the sensorimotor system which demonstrates significantly decreased metabolic activity.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Structure of the synaptic membranes in the inner plexiform layer of the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>: a freeze-fracture study in monkeys and rabbits.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The internal structure of the synaptic membranes in the inner plexiform layer (IPL) of the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> of monkeys and rabbits was studied with the freeze-fracturing technique. In ribbon synapses, the presynaptic active zone is characterized by an aggregate of P-face particles, images of synaptic vesicle exocytosis, and forming coated vesicles which occupy distinct, contiguous membrane domains from apex to base of the synaptic ridge. The postsynaptic membrane contains a prominent aggregate of homogeneous particles which remain associated with the E-face. In the presynaptic membrane of conventional synapses, images of synaptic vesicle exocytosis are intermingled with large P-face particles, whereas forming coated vesicles surround the active zone. Three types of internal organization characterize the postsynaptic membrane of conventional synapses. Usually, the postsynaptic membrane exhibits the same internal structure as the surrounding nonjunctional plasmalemma. A second, less common type of conventional synapse contains a loose aggregate of heterogeneous particles which remain associated with the P-face. Finally, synapses were exceptionally found which are macular in shape and contain an aggregate of E-free particles within the postsynaptic membrane. The freeze-fracture evidence suggests that the axonal endings of bipolar cells--or at least some of them--make excitatory synapses, whereas the vast majority of amacrine cell dendrites make inhibitory synapses. Additional specializations of the cell surface in the inner plexiform layer(IPL) include gap junctions, puncta adhaerentia, subsurface cisterns, and cell corner aggregates.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

By using a double-labelling immunohistochemical technique, we have shown that these two enzymes are located in separate amacrine cell populations in the human <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>. In normal human <BrainRegion>retinas</BrainRegion> from organ donors, we have shown that there was no change in the number, somal area, or retinal distribution of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate diaphorase(NADPHd) + neurons over an age range of 19-89 years. In contrast, there was a significant decrease (P &amp;lt; 0.05) of 52% in the total number of tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive(TH-IR) neurons in the group aged 65-89 years compared with the group aged 19-64 years. CA1 and CA2 tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive(TH-IR) neurons were reduced by 44% and 55%, respectively. In young (3 months) and old (2 years) rats, the number of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate diaphorase(NADPHd) + neurons did not decrease with ageing, but the number of tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive(TH-IR) neurons was significantly reduced by 21% (P &lt; 0.05). In a companion study on monkey <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>, we have shown that a postmortem delay of 12.5 hours between death and fixation results in a decrease of 33% in the number of both nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate diaphorase(NADPHd) + and tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive(TH-IR) neurons in the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> compared with the number in <BrainRegion>retinas</BrainRegion> fixed immediately after death. The findings of this study on the two subsets of amacrine cells, therefore, are likely to demonstrate the consequences of ageing in the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> and might contribute to visual impairment in the elderly.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Origin of <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> inputs to the <BrainRegion>primary, premotor, and supplementary motor cortical areas</BrainRegion> and to <BrainRegion>area 46</BrainRegion> in macaque monkeys: a multiple retrograde tracing study.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The origin of <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> inputs to distinct <BrainRegion>motor cortical areas</BrainRegion> was established in five monkeys to determine whether the <BrainRegion>motor areas</BrainRegion> receive inputs from a common <BrainRegion>thalamic nucleus</BrainRegion> and the extent to which the territories of origin overlap. To not rely on the rough definition of cytoarchitectonic boundaries in the <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion>, monkeys were subjected to multiple injections of tracers (four to seven) in the <BrainRegion>primary (M1), premotor (PM), and supplementary (SMA) motor cortical areas</BrainRegion> and in <BrainRegion>area 46</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>cortical areas</BrainRegion> were distributed into five groups, each receiving inputs from a specific set of <BrainRegion>thalamic nuclei</BrainRegion>: 1) <BrainRegion>M1</BrainRegion>; 2) <BrainRegion>supplementary(SMA) -proper</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>caudal part of the dorsal PMvc</BrainRegion>(PM) ( <BrainRegion>PMvc(PM) dc</BrainRegion>); 3) the <BrainRegion>rostral and caudal parts of the ventral PMvc</BrainRegion>(PM) ( <BrainRegion>PMvc(PM) vr</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>PMvc(PM) vc</BrainRegion>); 4) the <BrainRegion>rostral part of the dorsal PMvc</BrainRegion>(PM) ( <BrainRegion>PMvc(PM) dr</BrainRegion>); and 5) the <BrainRegion>superior and inferior parts of area 46</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>area 46sup</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>area 46inf</BrainRegion>). A major degree of overlap was obtained for the origins of the thalamocortical projections directed to <BrainRegion>areas 46inf</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>46sup</BrainRegion> and for those terminating in <BrainRegion>supplementary(SMA) -proper</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>PMvc(PM) dc</BrainRegion>. <BrainRegion>PMvc(PM) vc</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>PMvc(PM) vr</BrainRegion> received inputs from adjacent and/or common <BrainRegion>thalamic regions</BrainRegion>. In contrast, the degree of overlap between <BrainRegion>M1</BrainRegion> and supplementary(<BrainRegion>SMA)</BrainRegion> was smaller. The projection to <BrainRegion>M1</BrainRegion> shared relatively limited zones of origin with the projections directed to <BrainRegion>PMvc</BrainRegion>(PM) . <BrainRegion>Thalamic</BrainRegion> inputs to the <BrainRegion>motor cortical areas</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>M1</BrainRegion>, supplementary(<BrainRegion>SMA</BrainRegion>) , <BrainRegion>PMvc(PM) d</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>PMvc(PM) v</BrainRegion>), in general, were segregated from those directed to <BrainRegion>area 46</BrainRegion>, except in the <BrainRegion>mediodorsal nucleus</BrainRegion>, in which there was clear overlap of the territories sending projections to <BrainRegion>area 46</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>supplementary(SMA) -proper</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>PMvc(PM) dc</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Distribution of catecholaminergic neuronal systems in the canine <BrainRegion>medulla oblongata</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>pons</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The distribution of catecholamine-containing neurons, fibers, and varicosities in the <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion> of both adult and juvenile dogs was mapped in detail with glyoxylic acid histofluorescence. Four separate groups of catecholamine-fluorescent neurons were identified within the canine <BrainRegion>medulla</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>pons</BrainRegion> in locations comparable to the <BrainRegion>A1</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>A2</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>A5</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>A6 regions</BrainRegion> reported in other species. However, aspects of the pattern and density of the catecholaminergic neuronal systems appeared to be unique to the dog. The <BrainRegion>A1</BrainRegion> neurons of the <BrainRegion>caudal ventrolateral medulla</BrainRegion> were much more scattered than in rats or rabbits, but relatively similar to cats. In the <BrainRegion>A2 region</BrainRegion> of the <BrainRegion>dorsomedial medulla</BrainRegion>, catecholaminergic cells and fibers were uniquely distributed compared to other species: fluorescent neurons were scattered only within the <BrainRegion>dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus</BrainRegion>, and a distinctive pattern of fibers and varicosities outlined the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>A5</BrainRegion> neurons of the <BrainRegion>rostral ventrolateral medulla</BrainRegion> appeared at the rostral limit of the <BrainRegion>A1 region</BrainRegion>. Fluorescent <BrainRegion>A5</BrainRegion> cells were more sparse than in rats or primates, and were patterned similarly to cats and rabbits. The canine <BrainRegion>A6 region</BrainRegion> contained the most extensive and dense grouping of catecholamine neurons and was similar in pattern to the rabbits but less extensive than that seen in cats or primates. An ascending catecholaminergic fiber pathway was traced through the central tegmental field of the canine <BrainRegion>medulla</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>pons</BrainRegion>, with features similar to the primate. The present study provides the first description of the catecholaminergic neuronal systems of the canine <BrainRegion>medulla</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>The <BrainRegion>superior vestibular nucleus</BrainRegion>: an intracellular HRP study in the cat. I. Vestibulo-ocular neurons.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText><BrainRegion>Superior vestibular</BrainRegion> neurons were penetrated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-loaded glass microelectrodes in anesthetized cats. Responses to electrical stimulation of the <BrainRegion>oculomotor complex</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>vestibular nerves</BrainRegion> were characterized and selected neurons were injected with horseradish peroxidase(HRP) . Neurons antidromically activated by <BrainRegion>oculomotor complex</BrainRegion> stimulation were generally monosynaptically excited by the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral vestibular nerve</BrainRegion>. Notable was the absence of strong <BrainRegion>commissural</BrainRegion> inhibition by stimulation of the <BrainRegion>contralateral vestibular nerve</BrainRegion>. Light microscopy of antidromically identified injected cells demonstrated that these cells are predominantly located at the central levels of the <BrainRegion>superior vestibular nucleus</BrainRegion> along the incoming <BrainRegion>vestibular nerve</BrainRegion> fibers but a few are found at more caudal levels. Cell bodies, elongated or pyramidal, are mainly medium-sized to large (30-50 micrometers). Dendritic trees extend in a plane at an acute to the collaterals of the <BrainRegion>vestibular nerve</BrainRegion> fibers. Dendrites remain within the nuclear territory and generally display an isodendritic branching pattern. Dendritic spines and appendages are mainly distributed on secondary and distal dendrites. A few terminal enlargements similar to growth cones are observed in these neurons. Axons of these neurons project rostrally via the medial longitudinal fasciculus, while a minor projection via the <BrainRegion>brachium conjunctivum</BrainRegion> is also found. Axon collaterals, when present, originate in the nucleus itself and in the <BrainRegion>pontine reticular formation</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Distribution of catecholamine-containing nerves on blood vessels of the rat trachea.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>This study was performed to determine the distribution of catecholamine-containing sympathetic nerves on blood vessels of the rat trachea. The glyoxylic acid method was used to visualize catecholamine-containing axons in tracheal whole mounts, and silicone vascular casts were used to elucidate the architecture of the vasculature. We also examined the relationship of these axons to the trachea&apos;s plexus of cholinergic nerves and ganglia, using tracheal whole mounts stained for acetylcholinesterase activity. We found that most catecholamine-containing axons were associated with arterioles located between cartilaginous rings or in the posterior membrane. In both regions, catecholamine-containing nerves were most abundant at the origin of terminal arterioles, which supplied the airway mucosa and smooth muscle. At the origin of these vessels, the fluorescent axons changed their orientation from longitudinal to circumferential. Few fluorescent axons were present beyond this region of the terminal arterioles, and none was found on capillaries or venules or on smooth muscle cells of the posterior membrane. Fluorescent axons were present in some tracheal ganglia but non enveloped neuronal cell bodies or had varicosities, and no ganglion cells had glyoxylic acid-induced fluorescence. Catecholamine-fluorescence was also present in clusters of small intensely fluorescent (SIF) cells, which were located in the adventitia of the posterior membrane and in the longitudinal nerve trunks which ran the length of the trachea. Pargyline pretreatment increased the fluorescence of axons and small intensely fluorescent(SIF) cells but did not reveal a different distribution of these structures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>The fine structure of the rat <BrainRegion>subthalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>: an electron microscopic study.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The normal ultrastructure of the rat <BrainRegion>subthalamic nucleus</BrainRegion> (STH) was studied. The <BrainRegion>subthalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>(STH) consisted of tightly packed neurons distributed within a neuropil filled with large numbers of blood vessels and thinly myelinated fibers. The somata of <BrainRegion>subthalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>(STH) neurons (diameters, D, between 10 and 25 micron) contained abundant organelles but had only a small amount of both smooth and rough endoplasmic reticulum. The nuclei had deeply invaginated nuclear envelopes and pale nucleoplasm with little heterochromatin. <BrainRegion>subthalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>(STH) neurons often were tightly apposed without any intervening glial membranes. Similar appositions were also found between somata and dendrites, dendrites and dendrites, and dendrites and initial axon segments. Although puncta adhaerentia were often observed, no gap junctions were found on any of these membrane appositions. In the neuropil, the dendrites were mostly smooth and thin (D between 0.5 and 1 micron) with an occasional stubby spine or thin dendritic appendage. At least two types of axon terminals were identified. Type 1 terminals (D up to 1 micron) contained medium-sized round vesicles (D about 45 nm) and formed asymmetrical synapses. Type 2 terminals were often large (D up to 5 micron) and contained both round and slightly flattened vesicles (D up to 50 nm). The type 2 terminals frequently formed adherens junctions with their postsynaptic targets in addition to forming relatively symmetrical synaptic junctions. The remaining axon terminals included a small number of terminals with various morphological characteristics and possibly some tangentially sectioned type 1 and type 2 terminals. Therefore they have not been classified as individual types in this study. A quantitative analysis indicated that the type 1 terminals formed synapses mainly with thin dendrites whereas the type 2 terminals formed synapses mainly with somata and larger dendrites.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Anatomy and neurochemistry of the pair bond.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Studies in monogamous rodents have begun to elucidate the neural circuitry underlying the formation and maintenance of selective pair bonds between mates. This research suggests that at least three distinct, yet interconnected, neural pathways interact in the establishment of the pair bond. These include circuits involved in conveying somatosensory information from the genitalia to the brain during sexual activity, the <BrainRegion>mesolimbic</BrainRegion> dopamine circuits of reward and reinforcement, and neuropeptidergic circuits involved specifically in the processing of socially salient cues. Here we present an integrated description of the interaction of these circuits in a model of pair bond formation in rodents with a discussion of the implications of these findings for evolution, individual variation, and human bonding.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Formation of the avian <BrainRegion>nucleus magnocellularis</BrainRegion> from the auditory anlage.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>In the avian auditory system, the neural network for computing the localization of sound in space begins with bilateral innervation of <BrainRegion>nucleus laminaris</BrainRegion> (NL) by <BrainRegion>nucleus magnocellularis</BrainRegion> (NM) neurons. We used antibodies against the neural specific markers Hu C/D, neurofilament, and SV2 together with retrograde fluorescent dextran labeling from the <BrainRegion>contralateral hindbrain</BrainRegion> to identify <BrainRegion>nucleus magnocellularis</BrainRegion>(NM) neurons within the anlage and follow their development. <BrainRegion>nucleus magnocellularis</BrainRegion>(NM) neurons could be identified by retrograde labeling as early as embryonic day (E) 6. While the auditory anlage organized itself into <BrainRegion>nucleus magnocellularis</BrainRegion>(NM) and <BrainRegion>nucleus laminaris</BrainRegion>(NL) in a rostral-to-caudal fashion between E6 and E8, labeled <BrainRegion>nucleus magnocellularis</BrainRegion>(NM) neurons were visible throughout the extent of the anlage at E6. By observing the pattern of neuronal rearrangements together with the pattern of contralaterally projecting <BrainRegion>nucleus magnocellularis</BrainRegion>(NM) fibers, we could identify <BrainRegion>nucleus laminaris</BrainRegion>(NL) in the ventral anlage. <BrainRegion>Ipsilateral nucleus magnocellularis</BrainRegion>(NM) fibers contacted the developing <BrainRegion>nucleus laminaris</BrainRegion>(NL) at E8, well after <BrainRegion>nucleus magnocellularis</BrainRegion>(NM) collaterals had projected contralaterally. Furthermore, the formation of ipsilateral connections between <BrainRegion>nucleus magnocellularis</BrainRegion>(NM) and <BrainRegion>nucleus laminaris</BrainRegion>(NL) neurons appeared to coincide with the arrival of <BrainRegion>VIIIth nerve</BrainRegion> fibers in <BrainRegion>nucleus magnocellularis</BrainRegion>(NM) . By E10, immunoreactivity for SV2 was heavily concentrated in the dorsal and ventral neuropils of <BrainRegion>nucleus laminaris</BrainRegion>(NL) . Thus, extensive pathfinding and morphological rearrangement of <BrainRegion>central auditory nuclei</BrainRegion> occurs well before the arrival of <BrainRegion>cochlear</BrainRegion> afferents. Our results suggest that <BrainRegion>nucleus magnocellularis</BrainRegion>(NM) neurons may play a central role in formation of tonotopic connections in the auditory system.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Stages in the structural differentiation of <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> ganglion cells.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Using a cultured wholemount technique we have studied the morphological differentiation of ganglion cells in the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> of the rat and cat, during normal development. In both species the differentiation of ganglion cells begins in embryonic life, before embryonic day (E) 17 in the rat and E36 in the cat. It is useful to describe the morphological differentiation of ganglion cells as occurring in three stages. In the first stage, each germinal cell becoming a ganglion cell extends an axon into the fibre layer of the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> and towards the <BrainRegion>optic disc</BrainRegion>, and the soma of the cell moves towards the ganglion cell layer. As the soma approaches the ganglion cell layer, the processes that attach its poles to the inner and outer surfaces of the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> are withdrawn. When the soma reaches the ganglion cell layer, a stage of active dendritic growth begins, which lasts until shortly before birth in the cat and until several days after birth in the rat. The cell extends stem dendrites that branch profusely and are commonly tipped by growth cones. The major morphological classes of ganglion cell become distinct in the latter part of stage 2, as do the centroperipheral gradients in ganglion cell size apparent in the cat. During the third stage, the dendritic trees of ganglion cells no longer branch or extend by means of active growth cones. Very considerable growth of all parameters of the cell (soma size, dendrite calibre and length, axon calibre) occurs nevertheless, presumably by interstitial addition of membrane throughout the cell.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Developmental expression of a synaptic ribbon antigen (B16) in mouse <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>We investigated the developmental expression of the synaptic antigen B16 in the outer and inner plexiform layers in the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>. We compared the expression of this protein with published accounts of <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> ribbon synaptogenesis. The time course of B16 expression was found to be similar, if not identical, to the time course of synaptogenesis in the photoreceptor terminal, supporting our idea of the synaptic nature of the B16 protein. This study provides further evidence which suggests that the B16 antigen is a ribbon associated protein. The morphology, location, and developmental expression of this antigen is coincident with the structure and development of the ribbon synaptic elements located in both the photoreceptor and bipolar terminals. The emergence of the B16 protein was also examined in <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> from mice homozygous for the <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> degeneration (rd) mutation which affects photoreceptor synaptogenesis. The B16 expression in the <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> degeneration(rd) <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> parallels that in the wild-type <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> at early stages of development. However, significant changes in the morphology and staining pattern of the B16 antigen in the retinal degeneration(rd) <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> occurring at later postnatal stages are consistent with the degeneration observed in the photoreceptor terminals.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Ultrastructural development of Rohon-Beard neurons: loss of intramitochondrial granules parallels loss of calcium action potentials.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>We have examined the ultrastructure of the cell body of a vertebrate <BrainRegion>spinal</BrainRegion> neuron, the Rohon-Beard cell of Xenopus laevis, at four stages during its development (Nieuwkoop and Faber stages: 22, 29/30, 37/38 and 42). At this time it has attained its electrical excitability and the action potential mechanism in the cell body is maturing through a sequence of stages in which the inward current is carried by Ca++ (stages 20-25), later by Ca++ and Na+ (stages 25-40), and finally by Na+ (stages 40-51) (Spitzer and Baccaglini, &apos;76; Baccaglini and Spitzer, '77). There is a change in the abundance and distribution of the organelles in the perikaryon during this period, characteristic of other developing neurons. Mitochondria and Golgi apparatus become localized progressively more in the interior of the cells, and rough endoplasmic reticulum progressively more to the periphery where it often appears in orderly tiers parallel to the plasma membrane. The mitochondria contain dense intramitochondrial granules which are known in other cells to contain concentrations of divalent cations. The number of granules declines over the course of the developmental period studied. The presence of the intramitochondrial granules was examined quantitatively because electrophysiological data indicate that the amount of Ca++ entering the cells in early stages should raise the internal Ca++ concentration by several orders of magnitude, and that Ca++ is rapidly sequestered (Baccaglini and Spitzer, '77). A minimum of 200 mitochondrial profiles from at least four Rohon-Beard cells were scored for the presence of dense intramitochondrial granules at each stage studied. In stage 22 Rohon-Beard cells 75 +/- 5% (mean +/- SD, n = 4) of the mitochondrial profiles scored contained granules; in stage 29/30, 56 +/- 10% (n = 7); in stage 37/38, 3 +/- 3% (n = 5); and in stage 42, 0.5 +/- 0.25% (n = 4). Therefore, dense intramitochondrial granules, an indication of calcium accumulation in mitochondria, decrease in parallel with the loss of the Ca++ component of the inward current of the action potential in Rohon-Beard neurons.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Central innervation of the rat <BrainRegion>ependyma</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>subcommissural organ</BrainRegion> with special reference to ascending serotoninergic projections from the <BrainRegion>raphe nuclei</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The <BrainRegion>subcommissural organ</BrainRegion> (SCO) and the <BrainRegion>cerebral ependyma</BrainRegion> receive serotoninergic innervation, but little is known about their origin in the <BrainRegion>raphe nuclei</BrainRegion>. Application of the retrograde tracer cholera toxin subunit B (ChB) in the <BrainRegion>third ventricle</BrainRegion> resulted in uptake in ependymal axons and backfilling of perikarya in the dorsomedian part of the <BrainRegion>dorsal raphe nucleus</BrainRegion>, immediately under the caudal aqueduct. By using dual staining with antisera against serotonin and cholera toxin subunit B(ChB) , a portion of the retrogradely labeled neurons was observed to co-store serotonin. Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) was injected into different <BrainRegion>raphe nuclei</BrainRegion> to fill the neurons in the same areas where the retrogradely labeled neurons were found. Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin(PHA-L) injection in the midline of the <BrainRegion>dorsal raphe nucleus</BrainRegion> gave rise to ascending axonal processes in the <BrainRegion>mesencephalic central gray</BrainRegion>, from where they entered the <BrainRegion>periventricular strata</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>third ventricular ependyma</BrainRegion>. In the <BrainRegion>cerebral ependyma</BrainRegion>, large numbers of positive fibers were consistently found in the <BrainRegion>ventral part of the lateral ventricles</BrainRegion> and in the <BrainRegion>dorsal part of the third ventricle</BrainRegion>. A large number of Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin(PHA-L) -immunoreactive fibers were observed in the hypendymal layer of the <BrainRegion>lateral part of the subcommissural organ</BrainRegion>(SCO) . Terminal fibers near the <BrainRegion>ependymal</BrainRegion> cells were also observed. In all cases, the Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin(PHA-L) injections labeled innervating fibers both within the <BrainRegion>ependyma</BrainRegion> and in the <BrainRegion>subcommissural organ</BrainRegion>(SCO) , whereas injections into the <BrainRegion>median raphe nucleus</BrainRegion> or in other <BrainRegion>raphe nuclei</BrainRegion> (i.e., the <BrainRegion>raphe pallidus</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>raphe pontis</BrainRegion>) labeled f in other <BrainRegion>raphe nucle</BrainRegion>i(i.e.) s neither in the <BrainRegion>subcommissural organ</BrainRegion>(SCO) nor in the <BrainRegion>ependyma</BrainRegion>. This study shows that a specific group of predominantly seroton in other <BrainRegion>raphe nuclei</BrainRegion>(i.e.) gic neurons innervates both the <BrainRegion>ependyma</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>subcommissural organ</BrainRegion>(SCO) and is probably involved in <BrainRegion>cerebrospinal fluid</BrainRegion> regulation.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Localization of TrkC to Schwann cells and effects of neurotrophin-3 signaling at neuromuscular synapses.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Neurotrophins and their receptors, the Trks, are differentially expressed among the cell types that make up neuromuscular and other synapses, but the function and directionality of neurotrophin signaling at synapses are poorly understood. Here we demonstrate, via immunostaining, Western blotting, and RT-PCR analyses, that TrkC, the receptor for neurotrophin-3 (NT3), is expressed by mouse perisynaptic and myelinating Schwann cells from birth through adulthood and is unaltered after denervation. Analyses of transgenic mice in which the neurotrophin-3(NT3) coding sequence is replaced by lacZ showed that neurotrophin-3(NT3) is expressed in motor neurons and Schwann cells during perinatal development, but not in adult mice. In muscle, neurotrophin-3(NT3) is expressed by intrafusal muscle fibers within spindles, as has been previously reported. Surprisingly, neurotrophin-3(NT3) is also expressed in extrafusal muscle fibers during perinatal life and in adults. Genetic approaches were used to explore the roles of neurotrophin-3(NT3) and TrkC signaling at neuromuscular synapses. Overexpression of neurotrophin-3(NT3) in muscle fibers during development resulted in an increased number of perisynaptic Schwann cells at neuromuscular synapses, without altering synaptic size, suggesting that muscle-derived neurotrophin-3(NT3) might act as a mitogen or trophic factor for Schwann cells. Conditional deletion of neurotrophin-3(NT3) from motor neurons did not alter the number of Schwann cells or other aspects of neuromuscular synaptic structure, suggesting that motor-neuron-derived neurotrophin-3(NT3) is not required for normal development of perisynaptic Schwann cells or synapses. Together, these results demonstrate that neurotrophin-3(NT3) expression is developmentally regulated in skeletal muscle and may modulate the number of Schwann cells at neuromuscular synapses.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Local circuit neurons of macaque monkey <BrainRegion>striate cortex</BrainRegion>: I. Neurons of laminae 4C and 5A.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>A study has been made, using Golgi preparations, of the organization of neurons with smooth or sparsely spined dendrites, here called local circuit neurons, of the macaque monkey <BrainRegion>primary visual cortex</BrainRegion>. Since these neurons include those responsible for inhibitory circuitry of the <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion>, a better understanding of their anatomical organization is essential to concepts of functional organization of the region. This account describes those neurons found with cell body and major dendritic spread within the <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> recipient zone of lamina 4C and its border zone with lamina 5A. The neurons are grouped firstly in terms of in which laminar division the soma occurred--4C beta, 4C alpha or the border zone of 5A-4C beta--and secondly, into varieties on the basis of the interlaminar projection patterns of their axons. Most, if not all, of the local circuit neurons of these divisions have interlaminar axon projections as well as an arbor local to their cell body and dendritic field. These interlaminar projections are highly specific, targeting from one to five laminar divisions depending on the variety of neuron; on this basis 17 varieties of local circuit neuron are described. While the number of varieties appears dauntingly large in terms of understanding the functional circuitry of the region, the clear-cut organization of the interlaminar links may provide clues as to the information processing that concerns each neuron. The local circuit neuron axon projections can be related to a wealth of information already available concerning the laminar organization of afferent axons and efferent cell groups, the organization of spiny neuron intrinsic relays (presumed to be excitatory), and physiological properties of different laminar divisions. It is hoped that the information derived from this study can serve as a guide for correlated physiological-anatomical studies on single cells of the region.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Distribution of G-protein alpha subunits and neurotransmitter activation of g(alphai) and g(alphaq) in the brain of the lobster Homarus americanus.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Immunocytochemistry using antisera specific for the G-protein alpha subunits G(alphai), G(alphaq), and G(alphas) revealed similar patterns of immunoreactivity in the lobster brain. Immunoreactivity was strongest in neuropil, especially the <BrainRegion>olfactory and accessory lobes</BrainRegion>, and was characterized by bundles of fine threads leading to dense concentrations of punctate staining in the glomeruli. This may reflect the concentration of G-protein alpha subunits at synapses. The major differences between the antisera were distinct patterns of staining intensity in subregions of glomeruli of the <BrainRegion>olfactory and accessory lobes</BrainRegion>. This result is potentially correlated with previous evidence that these subregions are neurochemically distinct. Neuronal cell bodies contained moderate levels of immunoreactivity at the plasma membrane and faint staining in the cytoplasm. The <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> globular tract was moderately immunoreactive, but other fiber tracts were weakly immunoreactive. Immunoreactivity in the <BrainRegion>deutocerebral commissure</BrainRegion> consisted of small oval cell bodies and strands that formed a reticulated pattern, suggestive of glia. Photoaffinity labelling by using an analog of GTP demonstrated that histamine activated G(alphai) in brain homogenates. Further evidence of G-protein activation was obtained by showing that stimulation with a mixture of neuroactive substances increased the amount of phospholipase C-beta associated with membranes, G(alphaq), and G(beta). The lobster brain, especially in its neuropil regions, is richly endowed with neuromodulatory biochemical pathways involving G(alphai), G(alphaq), and G(alphas).</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Development of the rat septohippocampal projection: tracing with DiI and electron microscopy of identified growth cones.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The factors determining the development of specific fiber tracts in the central nervous system as well as the interactions of growth cones with the surrounding micromilieu are largely unknown. Here we investigated the ontogenetic development of the septohippocampal projection in the rat with the lipophilic carbocyanine dye DiI which is transported anterogradely and retrogradely in neurons and can be applied to fixed embryonic tissue. Photoconversion of anterogradely labeled fibers allowed us to study individual growth cones by electron microscopy. The first axons originating from the <BrainRegion>septal complex</BrainRegion> were found in the <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion> as early as on embryonic day (ED) 19, reaching the <BrainRegion>fimbrial pole of the hippocampus</BrainRegion> on embryonic day(ED) 18. However, on embryonic day(ED) 17 we consistently found retrogradely labeled cells in the <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion>, indicating that the development of the <BrainRegion>hippocamposeptal</BrainRegion> projection precedes that of the septohippocampal projection. On embryonic day(ED) 19, the majority of the axons directed toward the <BrainRegion>hippocampal formation</BrainRegion> passed the <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion> and grew further into the <BrainRegion>subicular complex</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>entorhinal cortex</BrainRegion>. These axons gave off collaterals that invaded the <BrainRegion>hippocampus proper</BrainRegion>. A fairly adult pattern of the septohippocampal projection was reached on postnatal day 10, although may growth cones were still found. A comparative analysis of individual growth cones found in the <BrainRegion>fimbria</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>hippocampus proper</BrainRegion> revealed no striking differences in their morphology. Electron microscopic analysis showed that growth cones in the <BrainRegion>fimbria</BrainRegion> were mainly contacted by other axons, whereas growth cones in the <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion> had contact with all available elements. This may indicate that growing septohippocampal fibers are guided by axons of the earlier formed <BrainRegion>hippocamposeptal</BrainRegion> projection. In the <BrainRegion>hippocampus proper</BrainRegion>, other cues, probably derived from the target itself, may guide the septohippocampal axons to their appropriate target cells.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Ultrastructure of mouse vallate taste buds: III. Patterns of synaptic connectivity.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>We have used serial high voltage electron micrographs and computer-generated, three-dimensional reconstructions to study morphological relationships and patterns of synaptic connectivity in taste buds from the circumvallate papillae of the mouse. The intragemmal arborizations of 40 sensory nerve fibers were examined from 7 taste buds that were sectioned serially. We identified the synaptic connections from taste cells onto the reconstructed nerve fibers and classified the presynaptic taste cells based on previously established ultrastructural criteria. From these data we were able to extract the following information for the reconstructed nerve fibers: (1) the morphology of intragemmal nerve fibers and their arborizations within the taste bud, (2) the total number of synaptic connections from taste bud cells onto the nerve fibers, and (3) the taste cell types associated with each of the synapses. Fifty-six synapses were studied. Synapses were often found to be located at either the branch points or terminations of nerve fiber processes. The maximum number of taste cells observed to synapse onto a single nerve fiber was 5. Several nerve fibers had no apparent synapses. Dark cells (type I), intermediate cells, and light cells (type II) all formed synaptic connections with sensory nerve fibers. In no cases did dark cells and light cells synapse onto the same sensory nerve fiber. Our observation that any given nerve fiber receives its synaptic input from morphologically similar taste cells provides evidence for specificity in taste bud synaptic connections. We speculate that the observed pattern of synaptic connections is related to taste bud function. Since all of the synapses onto a given nerve fiber are from morphologically similar taste cells, we postulate that there is a correlation between taste cell morphology and sensory responsiveness. Intracellular electrophysiological studies on taste cells, in which responses to focally applied chemical stimuli are followed by characterization of the ultrastructural features of the same taste cells, will prove or disprove this hypothesis.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Gradients between nasal and temporal areas of the cat <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> in the properties of <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> ganglion cells.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Evidence is presented of gradients between nasal and temporal areas of the cat&apos;s <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> in the properties of their ganglion cell populations. Mean ganglion cell size is greater in <BrainRegion>temporal retina</BrainRegion> than in <BrainRegion>nasal retina</BrainRegion>, partly because the alpha- and beta-cells of <BrainRegion>temporal retina</BrainRegion> are distinctly bigger than their counterparts in <BrainRegion>nasal retina</BrainRegion>, and partly because more medium-sized cells, and fewer small cells, are to be found in <BrainRegion>temporal retina</BrainRegion>. This high proportion of medium-sized ganglion cells may reflect a high proportion of beta-cells or of the medium sized gamma-cells described by Stone and Clarke (&apos;80). Several of these differences can be related to prior morphological, electrophysiological, and behavioural observations in the cat, and similar differences have been reported in several other mammalian species. Evidence is presented that, in the cat, at least some of these differences are less marked near the <BrainRegion>vertical meridian of the retina</BrainRegion> than more temporally or nasally. The present results may therefore, be evidence of a nasal-temporal gradient in <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> structure and funtion common to many mammals, and distinct from previously recognised gradients in ganglion cell properties related to the area centralis and visual streak specialisations.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Location and completeness of reinnervation by two types of neurons at a single target: the feline muscle spindle.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Muscle spindles from the tenuissimus muscle of the cat were examined microscopically to assess the precision and completeness of reinnervation of intrafusal muscle fibers by efferent and afferent neurons. Positions of motor and sensory nerve terminals were charted relative to the cross-sectional area enclosed by the outer capsule of the spindle. Profiles of nerve endings were measured for normally innervated and reinnervated spindles. The tenuissimus was deprived of innervation by freezing its nerve, sometimes in conjunction with either spinal ganglion removal or ventral rhizotomy. Sensory and motor terminals occupied separate locales along the length of normal muscle spindles. Nerve terminals of efferent and afferent neurons were located in appropriate positions along the length of spindles when axons of both types of neurons regrew together and when either category of axon regenerated alone. Precise reinnervation of muscle spindles occurred in spite of a diminished diameter of intrafusal fibers. Repopulation of the spindle with motor endings was less complete than that by sensory endings, based on the proportion and size of the regenerated terminals. We conclude that under optimal conditions for axonal regrowth, efferent and afferent neurons reinnervate their respective regions along intrafusal muscle fibers but motor lags sensory reinnervation within the spindle. The mechanism by which positional specificity happens during reinnervation of intrafusal fibers requires neither an interaction between terminals of the two types of neurons nor target cells of normal bulk.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>The specificity of innervation of regenerating motor neurons in the cockroach.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The pattern of neuromuscular connections of cockroach motor neurons regenerating to an intact mesothoracic leg after crushing nerve 5 has been investigated. While a number of anatomically identified motor neurons reestablished functional connections with their correct target muscles, some of the same and other motor neurons were found to functionally innervate inappropriate muscles. Muscles, and in some cases individual fibres, were often simultaneously innervated by both correct and foreign motor neurons. The frequency of innervation errors decreased with increasing post-operative times, although some errors persisted to the latest stages examined (227 days).</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Cortical</BrainRegion> neurons expressing the cholecystokinin gene in the rat: distribution in the adult brain, ontogeny, and some of their projections.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Recent studies of neuronal cholecystokinin (CCK) expression performed with more sensitive techniques have demonstrated that the distribution of the expression of this peptide is more widespread than previously thought. In the present study, hybridization histochemistry was used to map <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> neurons expressing the cholecystokinin(CCK) gene in adult and developing rats. Retrograde tracing with Fluorogold in combination with hybridization histochemistry was used to demonstrate some of the projections of these neurons. Neurons expressing the cholecystokinin(CCK) gene were found in all areas of the neo- and allocortices. They were of several morphological types, including pyramidal neurons, and were found in almost all layers, albeit at different relative numbers and with different levels of expression. Generally, layers II and III, deep layer V, and layer VI had many neurons expressing cholecystokinin(CCK) mRNA. Cortical cholecystokinin(CCK) expression was first detected on the 15th day of gestation in the primordial plexiform layer. Expression developed thereafter in a regular and continuous fashion until an adult-like pattern was present on the 21st day after birth. <BrainRegion>Cortical</BrainRegion> neurons containing cholecystokinin(CCK) mRNA were found in almost all the projections studied. Many neurons in both <BrainRegion>neo- and allocortical areas</BrainRegion> with cortico-cortical, associational, and commissural pathways contained cholecystokinin(CCK) mRNA. Similarly, numerous corticostriatal neurons contained cholecystokinin(CCK) mRNA; however, only a few corticothalamic neurons expressed cholecystokinin(CCK) mRNA. These results demonstrate that in the rat <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion> the distribution of projection neurons expressing cholecystokinin(CCK) is much more widespread than had been previously shown and will stimulate further investigations into the role of cholecystokinin(CCK) in these neurons.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Hormone complement of the Cancer productus sinus gland and pericardial organ: an anatomical and mass spectrometric investigation.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>In crustaceans, circulating hormones influence many physiological processes. Two neuroendocrine organs, the sinus gland (SG) and the pericardial organ (PO), are the sources of many of these compounds. As a first step in determining the roles played by hemolymph-borne agents in the crab Cancer productus, we characterized the hormone complement of its sinus gland(SG) and pericardial organ(PO) . We show via transmission electron microscopy that the nerve terminals making up each site possess dense-core and/or electron-lucent vesicles, suggesting diverse complements of bioactive molecules for both structures. By using immunohistochemistry, we show that small molecule transmitters, amines and peptides, are among the hormones present in these tissues, with many differentially distributed between the two sites (e.g., serotonin in the pericardial organ(PO) but not the sinus gland(SG) ). With several mass spectrometric (MS) methods, we identified many of the peptides responsible for the immunolabeling and surveyed the sinus gland(SG) and pericardial organ(PO) for peptides for which no antibodies exist. By using mass spectrometric(MS) , we characterized 39 known peptides [e.g., beta-pigment-dispersing hormone (beta-PDH), crustacean cardioactive peptide, and red pigment-concentrating hormone] and de novo sequenced 23 novel ones (e.g., a new beta-pigment-dispersing hormone(beta-PDH) isoform and the first B-type allatostatins identified from a non-insect species). Collectively, our results show that diverse and unique complements of hormones, including many previously unknown peptides, are present in the sinus gland(SG) and pericardial organ(PO) of C. productus. Moreover, our study sets the stage for future biochemical and physiological studies of these molecules and ultimately the elucidation of the role(s) they play in hormonal control in C. productus.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Metabolic activity in <BrainRegion>striate and extrastriate cortex</BrainRegion> in the hooded rat: contralateral and ipsilateral eye input.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The extent of changes in glucose metabolism resulting from ipsilateral and contralateral eye activity in the <BrainRegion>posterior cortex</BrainRegion> of the hooded rat was demonstrated by means of the C-14 2-deoxyglucose autoradiographic technique. By stimulating one eye with square wave gratings and eliminating efferent activation from the other by means of enucleation or intraocular TTX injection, differences between ipsilaterally and contralaterally based visual activity in the two hemispheres were maximized. Carbon-14 levels in layer IV of autoradiographs of coronal sections were measured and combined across sections to form right and left matrices of <BrainRegion>posterior cortex</BrainRegion> metabolic activity. A difference matrix, formed by subtracting the metabolic activity matrix of <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion> contralateral to the stimulated eye from the ipsilateral &quot;depressed" matrix, emphasized those parts of the <BrainRegion>visual cortex</BrainRegion> that received monocular visual input. The demarcation of <BrainRegion>striate cortex</BrainRegion> by means of cholinesterase stain and the examination of autoradiographs from sections cut tangential to the cortical surface aided in the interpretation of the difference matrices. In <BrainRegion>striate cortex</BrainRegion>, differences were maximal in the medial monocular portion, and the lateral or binocular portion was shown to be divided metabolically into a far lateral contralaterally dominant strip along the <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> representation of the vertical meridian, and a more medial region of patches of more or less contralaterally dominant binocular input. <BrainRegion>Lateral peristriate</BrainRegion> differences were less than those of <BrainRegion>striate cortex</BrainRegion>, and regions of greater and lesser monocular input could be distinguished. We did not detect differences between the two hemispheres in either anterior or <BrainRegion>medial peristriate areas</BrainRegion>, thus indicating either completely binocular input (which seems unlikely given the retinotopic organization of these regions), or a greater dependence than in the <BrainRegion>lateral peristriate</BrainRegion> on inputs that were not affected by the visual manipulations.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Fetal development of primate chemosensory corpuscles. II. Synaptic relationships in early gestation.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Fungiform papillae contained well-developed chemosensory corpuscles in macaque monkey fetuses with crown-rump lengths of 5.0-9.0 cm. These fetuses corresponded to stages from the last part of the first and beginning of the second trimester of gestation. Chemosensory cells extended from the epithelial basal lamina to the taste pore anlage at the apex of the corpuscle and had typical afferent synaptic contacts with presumptive gustatory axons. Apical secretory granules, the distinctive cytologic feature of sustentacular cells, were absent. Cells with cytologic characteristics intermediate between chemosensory cells and basal extragemmal cells were considered to be differentiating chemosensory (DC) cells and appeared to arise from existing basal cells as well as undifferentiated postmitotic cells. Although extragemmal cells were extensively coupled by gap junctions which are apparent in electron micrographs of thin sections, similar junctions were absent from chemosensory and differentiating chemosensory(DC) cells. While having minimal structural requirements for transduction and transmission of sapid stimuli (i.e., an intraoral surface and afferent synaptic contacts) chemosensory cells lacked efferent synapses and subsurface cisternae, which can be observed at later stages of gestation. Axoaxonic synapses, present between gustatory axons in the intragemmal and extragemmal epithelium and in the subgemmal connective tissue, were observed with greater frequency than at later stages of gestation. We conclude that the differentiation of chemosensory cells precedes the differentiation of sustentacular cells by several weeks. This fact lends support to the concept that chemosensory cells are a unique identifiable cells type in all chemosensory corpuscles.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>GABA-immunoreactive neurons and terminals in the <BrainRegion>lateral cervical nucleus</BrainRegion> of the cat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Previous findings have indicated the presence of local circuit neurons in the <BrainRegion>lateral cervical nucleus</BrainRegion> (LCN). An immunohistochemical study with gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) antiserum was therefore performed both to investigate whether gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) -immunoreactive neurons are present in the <BrainRegion>lateral cervical nucleus</BrainRegion>(LCN) , and if so, to compare their characteristics with those previously assigned to probable internuncial neurons in the nucleus. The fine structure and synaptology of gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) -positive boutons in the <BrainRegion>lateral cervical nucleus</BrainRegion>(LCN) were also studied. Transversely cut sections from the <BrainRegion>upper cervical spinal cord</BrainRegion> of three cats were processed for gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) immunohistochemistry with the free-floating PAP technique. On light microscopic examination immunoreactive neurons were observed within the <BrainRegion>ventromedial half of the lateral cervical nucleus</BrainRegion>(LCN) . Their total number was estimated to be 42.5 +/- 11.7 in the entire <BrainRegion>lateral cervical nucleus</BrainRegion>(LCN) on one side of the <BrainRegion>cervical spinal cord</BrainRegion>, but this may have been an underestimation, as the penetration by the antisera was limited. The labeled neurons were small and had a relatively large nucleus and a low bouton covering ratio. In their number, localization, and ultrastructural appearance the gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) -positive neurons closely resembled the population of neurons previously suggested to be local circuit neurons. Immunoreactive bouton-sized puncta were scattered throughout the <BrainRegion>lateral cervical nucleus</BrainRegion>(LCN) . Ultrastructural examination showed labeled terminals with a mean sectional area of 0.85 micron 2 and a relatively high density of synaptic vesicles. The vast majority of gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) -positive terminals were in contact with dendrites and only a minority had synaptic contact with cell bodies. No axoaxonal synapses were observed. The gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) -positive boutons probably derive at least partly from the observed gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) -positive neurons, but there is also a possibility of extrinsic gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) ergic input.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Hypothalamic</BrainRegion>, other <BrainRegion>diencephalic</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>telencephalic</BrainRegion> neurons that project to the <BrainRegion>dorsal midbrain</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Neurons in the <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion>, other <BrainRegion>diencephalic regions</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>telencephalon</BrainRegion> which project to the <BrainRegion>mesencephalic central gray</BrainRegion> (CG) and the region lateral to it were demonstrated, in the rat, by the horseradish peroxidase retrograde neuroanatomical tracing method with diaminobenzidine and tetramethyl benzidine visualization reactions. The greatest concentrations of neurons that project to the <BrainRegion>dorsal mesencephalon</BrainRegion> were found in the <BrainRegion>ventromedial nucleus</BrainRegion>, particularly the anterior and ventrolateral subdivisions, in the <BrainRegion>dorsal premammillary nucleus</BrainRegion>, and in the <BrainRegion>zona incerta</BrainRegion>. Neurons that project to or lateral to the <BrainRegion>central gray</BrainRegion>(CG) were also found in the <BrainRegion>laterocaudal hypothalamus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>dorsomedial hypothalamus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>regions of the anterior hypothalamic area</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>specific areas of the cerebral cortex</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>32, 29, 8, 8A, 13, 14</BrainRegion>), and the <BrainRegion>central nucleus of the amygdala</BrainRegion>. Some neurons that project were also found in the <BrainRegion>preoptic area</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>septum</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>bed nucleus of the stria terminals</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>habenula</BrainRegion>. More neurons in the <BrainRegion>mediocaudal quadrant of the hypothalamus</BrainRegion> project to the <BrainRegion>mesencephalon</BrainRegion> than do those in <BrainRegion>laterocaudal, mediorostral, or laterorostral quadrants</BrainRegion>. More neurons in the medial than the lateral half, and more in the caudal than the rostral half of the <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion> project to the <BrainRegion>mesencephalon</BrainRegion>. More neurons project to the <BrainRegion>central gray</BrainRegion>, or the region lateral to it, at the levels of the <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion>, or <BrainRegion>intercollicular region</BrainRegion>, than at the level of the <BrainRegion>inferior colliculus</BrainRegion>. These descending connections to the <BrainRegion>midbrain</BrainRegion>, particularly from the <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>zona incerta</BrainRegion>, are probably components of neural networks that regulate nociception, certain neuroendocrine functions, sexual and other behaviors, and certain autonomic functions.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Efferent connections of the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract</BrainRegion> in the rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The efferent connections of the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract</BrainRegion> (LOT) were examined in the rat with the Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) technique. Our observations reveal that layers II and III of lateral olfactory tract(LOT) have largely segregated outputs. Layer II projects chiefly ipsilaterally to the <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>anterior olfactory nucleus</BrainRegion>, bilaterally to the <BrainRegion>anterior piriform cortex</BrainRegion>, dwarf cell cap regions of the <BrainRegion>olfactory tubercle</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>lateral shell of the accumbens</BrainRegion>, and contralaterally to the <BrainRegion>lateral part of the interstitial nucleus of the posterior limb of the anterior commissure</BrainRegion>. Layer III sends strong bilateral projections to the <BrainRegion>rostral basolateral amygdaloid complex</BrainRegion>, which are topographically organized, and provides bilateral inputs to the <BrainRegion>core of the accumbens</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>caudate-putamen</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>agranular insular cortex</BrainRegion> (dorsal and posterior divisions). Layer II projects also to itself and to layers I and II of the contralateral lateral olfactory tract(LOT) , whereas layer III projects to itself, to ipsilateral layer II, and to contralateral layer III of lateral olfactory tract(LOT) . In double retrograde labeling experiments using Fluorogold and cholera toxin subunit b tracers, lateral olfactory tract(LOT) neurons from layers II and III were found to provide collateral projections to homonymous structures on both sides of the brain. Unlike other parts of the <BrainRegion>olfactory amygdala</BrainRegion>, lateral olfactory tract(LOT) neither projects directly to the extended <BrainRegion>amygdala</BrainRegion> nor to the <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion>. Thus, lateral olfactory tract(LOT) seemingly influences nonpheromonal olfactory-guided behaviors, especially feeding, by acting on the <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> and on <BrainRegion>ventral striatal</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>basolateral amygdaloid</BrainRegion> districts that are tightly linked to <BrainRegion>lateral prefrontal cortical</BrainRegion> operations.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Dendritic arbors and central projections of physiologically characterized auditory fibers from the saccule of the toadfish, Opsanus tau.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Neurobiotin was injected iontophoretically into <BrainRegion>saccular</BrainRegion> afferents of toadfish (Opsanus tau) after intracellular recording to examine dendritic arbors and central projections with respect to the physiological and directional response properties of the cells. Dendritic arbors of 36 afferents were examined in detail. Maximum diameter of the arbor and the number of terminal points were positively correlated with each other, but neither was predictive of spontaneous activity or sensitivity. Best azimuths were centered around 30 degrees -40 degrees, which corresponds to the angle of the <BrainRegion>saccule</BrainRegion> with respect to the fish&apos;s midline. In general, best elevations for afferents corresponded to hair cell orientations in the region innervated; unexpectedly low elevations obtained from afferents innervating the <BrainRegion>middle saccule</BrainRegion> may reflect curvature of the sensory epithelium against the <BrainRegion>otolith</BrainRegion>. Three efferent cells were filled partially. The location and large size of the efferent projections indicate that activity along the <BrainRegion>saccule</BrainRegion> could be modulated by a single efferent. All afferents projected to the <BrainRegion>dorsal zone of the descending octaval nucleus</BrainRegion> (dDON); many afferents bifurcated to terminate in the <BrainRegion>anterior octaval nucleus</BrainRegion>, and a few of those also had terminal fields in the <BrainRegion>medial zone of DON</BrainRegion>. All afferent projections into the <BrainRegion>descending octaval nucleus</BrainRegion>(dDON) consisted of multiple axon collaterals projecting to numerous sites along the rostral-caudal extent of the nucleus. Variation in terminal field sites also was noted in the medial to lateral axis of the <BrainRegion>descending octaval nucleus</BrainRegion>(dDON) ; however, there were no consistent correlations between terminal field locations, physiology, and best directions of the <BrainRegion>saccular</BrainRegion> afferents.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<AbstractText>Following horseradish peroxidase (HRP) injections in the <BrainRegion>superior, in the Deiters&apos;, in the medial, and in the descending vestibular nuclei</BrainRegion> in the hen, labeled cells are found in <BrainRegion>lateral longitudinal zones in the ipsilateral cerebellar cortex</BrainRegion>, most numerously in the <BrainRegion>anterior lobe</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>nodulus</BrainRegion>, the uvula, and the auricle. Furthermore, labeled cells are found bilaterally in the <BrainRegion>ventral parts of the medial and intermediate cerebellar nuclei</BrainRegion>. Lesions in the <BrainRegion>cerebellar cortex of the anterior lobe</BrainRegion> and in <BrainRegion>anterior parts of the posterior lobe</BrainRegion> result in terminal degeneration, mainly in the <BrainRegion>nucleus Deiters dorsalis</BrainRegion>, but also scantily, in peripheral regions of the <BrainRegion>superior nucleus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>nucleus Deiters ventralis</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>ventrolateral part of the medial nucleus</BrainRegion> and, mainly medially, in the <BrainRegion>descending nucleus</BrainRegion>. Lesions in the posterior part of the uvula, in the <BrainRegion>nodulus</BrainRegion>, and in the auricle result in much denser degeneration, most heavily affecting the <BrainRegion>nucleus Deiters dorsalis</BrainRegion>, but also affecting peripheral regions of the <BrainRegion>superior nucleus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>nucleus Deiters ventralis</BrainRegion>, the entire <BrainRegion>descending and medial nuclei</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>tangential nucleus</BrainRegion>. Lesions in the <BrainRegion>medial cerebellar nucleus</BrainRegion> result in degeneration bilaterally in the <BrainRegion>vestibular complex</BrainRegion>, most heavily affecting the <BrainRegion>nucleus Deiters ventralis</BrainRegion> and cell group B, but also affecting <BrainRegion>peripheral regions of the superior nucleus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>medial nucleus- mainly in dorsomedial regions</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>lateral and caudal parts of the descending nucleus</BrainRegion> and, very scantily, in the <BrainRegion>nucleus Deiters dorsalis</BrainRegion>.

<ArticleTitle>Substance P innervation of the rat and cat <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion>. I. Distribution and relation to ascending <BrainRegion>spinal</BrainRegion> pathways.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>An antiserum for substance P (SP) with minimal cross-reactivity for other tachykinins was employed to map the distribution of substance P(SP) -positive nerve fibers and terminals in the <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion> of cats and rats with special emphasis on the innervation by these fibers of nuclei related to the somatosensory system. In both species substance P(SP) innervation is predominantly along the midline, in <BrainRegion>medial and posterior thalamic regions</BrainRegion>, and sparser in sensory relays for specific modalities. Among the most densely innervated nuclei are the <BrainRegion>parafascicular</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>paraventricular</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>rhomboid</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>central medial and parts of mediodorsal</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>lateral posterior</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>ventral lateral geniculate</BrainRegion>. substance P(SP) innervation of <BrainRegion>somatosensory-related nuclei</BrainRegion> is also evident in <BrainRegion>central lateral nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>posterior complex</BrainRegion> (PO), and in <BrainRegion>ventroposterolateral (VPL) nucleus</BrainRegion> of both cats and rats. In <BrainRegion>ventroposterolateral</BrainRegion>(VPL) of cats substance P(SP) fibers and terminals are present along its ventral and lateral border, a paralaminar area in which <BrainRegion>spinothalamic</BrainRegion> fibers have been shown to terminate and where neurons responsive to noxious stimuli have been reported. Also in rats the substance P(SP) innervation of <BrainRegion>ventroposterolateral</BrainRegion>(VPL) is similar to that of <BrainRegion>spinothalamic</BrainRegion> tract fibers. The substance P(SP) innervation of <BrainRegion>somatosensory thalamic nuclei</BrainRegion> may be supplied, at least in part, by <BrainRegion>spinothalamic</BrainRegion> afferent as suggested by the depletion of substance P(SP) after anterolateral chordotomy but not after ablation of the <BrainRegion>dorsal column nuclei</BrainRegion>. The presence of substance P(SP) -positive <BrainRegion>spinothalamic</BrainRegion> neurons in the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> is reported in the following paper.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Movement of mitochondria in the axons and dendrites of cultured <BrainRegion>hippocampal</BrainRegion> neurons.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Mitochondria generate ATP and are involved in the regulation of cytoplasmic calcium levels. It is thought that local demand for mitochondria differs between axons and dendrites. Moreover, it has been suggested that the distribution of both energy need and calcium flux in dendrites changes with patterns of synaptic activation, whereas the distribution of these demands in axons is stable. The present study sought to determine whether there are differences in mitochondrial movements between axons and dendrites that may relate to differences in local mitochondrial demand. We labeled the mitochondria in cultured <BrainRegion>hippocampal</BrainRegion> neurons with a fluorescent dye and used time-lapse microscopy to examine their movements. In both axons and dendrites, approximately one-third of the mitochondria were in motion at any one time. In both domains, approximately 70% of the mitochondria moved in the anterograde direction, whereas the remainder moved in the retrograde direction. The velocity of the movements in each direction in each domain ranged from 0.1 microm/sec to approximately 2 microm/sec, and the means and distributions of the velocities were similar. Only one difference in the behavior of mitochondria between axons and dendrites emerged from this analysis. Mitochondria in axons were more likely to move with a consistently rapid velocity than were those in dendrites. As a result, mitochondria in axons tended to travel farther than mitochondria in dendrites. These results suggest that the transport of mitochondria in axons and dendrites is similar despite any differences in mitochondrial demand between the two domains.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<AbstractText>The <BrainRegion>medial geniculate body</BrainRegion> (MGB) is a <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> structure that provides vital information flow to the <BrainRegion>forebrain</BrainRegion> for complex acoustic processing. The development of cytoarchitectural features of the <BrainRegion>medial geniculate body</BrainRegion>(MGB) was examined in rat to identify age-related patterns of growth in major <BrainRegion>geniculate</BrainRegion> compartments that have been described previously (Clerici and Coleman [1990] J. Comp. Neurol. 297:14-31; Clerici et al. [1990] J. Comp.

Results show that, on the day of parturition, all major nuclei of each division are characterized, including the <BrainRegion>ovoid (OV) and ventral (LV) nuclei of MGv</BrainRegion>; the <BrainRegion>dorsal, deep dorsal (DD), caudodorsal, limitans, and suprageniculate nuclei of MGd</BrainRegion>; and the <BrainRegion>MGm</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>MGv</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>MGd</BrainRegion>, which display comparable areas at birth, show rapid growth to postnatal day 7 (PND7), which then slows until PND11, around the time of ear canal opening; subsequently, <BrainRegion>MGv</BrainRegion> accelerates growth to reach larger adult size. From PND11 to PND16, thionin facilitates parcellation by extensive staining of dendritic processes of <BrainRegion>MGd</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>MGm</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>lateral posterior nucleus</BrainRegion> neurons but not neurons of the <BrainRegion>MGv</BrainRegion> or the <BrainRegion>dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>. Golgi stains after birth reveal restricted dendritic arborizations in <BrainRegion>MGv</BrainRegion> cells and dichotomous branching patterns of <BrainRegion>MGd</BrainRegion> neurons. Somal size in <BrainRegion>medial geniculate body</BrainRegion>(MGB) increases dramatically subsequent to afferent innervation and again following onset of auditory function. Somal growth occurs between all postnatal age groups tested for <BrainRegion>ovoid(OV) , LV, and deep dorsal(DD) nuclei</BrainRegion>, although <BrainRegion>LV segments</BrainRegion> related to high and low frequencies do not differ. Cell packing density predicts the expanse of major <BrainRegion>medial geniculate body</BrainRegion>(MGB) divisions better than somal size. These results demonstrate the integrity and growth patterns of <BrainRegion>medial geniculate body</BrainRegion>(MGB) nuclei and divisions from nascence and provide a substrate for subsequent study of anatomical and physiological development of the <BrainRegion>medial geniculate body</BrainRegion>(MGB) .</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Location, morphology, and central projections of <BrainRegion>mesencephalic trigeminal</BrainRegion> neurons innervating rat masticatory muscles studied by axonal transport of choleragenoid-horseradish peroxidase.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Retrograde and transganglionic transport of horseradish peroxidase conjugated to the B-fragment of cholera toxin (B-HRP) was used to study the location, morphology, and central projections of <BrainRegion>mesencephalic trigeminal</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>Me5</BrainRegion>) neurons innervating rat masticatory muscles. Labeled <BrainRegion>Me5</BrainRegion> cell bodies were found throughout the <BrainRegion>Me5 nucleus</BrainRegion> from a level slightly caudal to the <BrainRegion>trigeminal motor nucleus</BrainRegion> to the level of the <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion> 5 mm further rostrally. Occasionally, labeled <BrainRegion>Me5</BrainRegion> cells were observed in the <BrainRegion>anterior medullary velum</BrainRegion>, in the <BrainRegion>cerebellum</BrainRegion>, and in the <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion> contralateral to the B-HRP injection. The vast majority of the labeled <BrainRegion>Me5</BrainRegion> cells were pseudounipolar, but multipolar cells were also found. Extensive central projections from labeled <BrainRegion>Me5</BrainRegion> cells could be seen extending from the <BrainRegion>nucleus of Darkschewitsch</BrainRegion> rostrally to the C2 segment caudally. Small but consistent projections from <BrainRegion>Me5</BrainRegion> neurons were observed in nuclear islands among the incoming <BrainRegion>Me5</BrainRegion> root fibers. <BrainRegion>Trigeminal and hypoglossal motor nuclei</BrainRegion> received direct projections from <BrainRegion>Me5</BrainRegion> cells, but not the <BrainRegion>facial motor nucleus</BrainRegion>. The most prominent <BrainRegion>Me5</BrainRegion> projections appeared in the <BrainRegion>brainstem reticular formation</BrainRegion>, including the <BrainRegion>supratrigeminal nucleus</BrainRegion>. Smaller projections also extended into the <BrainRegion>main sensory trigeminal nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>trigeminal subnucleus oralis</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Dendritic arbors of spiny neurons in the primate <BrainRegion>striatum</BrainRegion> are directionally polarized.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Despite the relatively unfeatured cytoarchitecture of the <BrainRegion>striatum</BrainRegion>, this large <BrainRegion>subcortical region</BrainRegion> has been found to have a modular macroscopic substructure comprising the neurochemically distinct striosomes and matrix, and, within the matrix, patchy input and output arrangements called matrisomes. In the study reported here, we explored the possibility that the cellular architecture of the <BrainRegion>striatum</BrainRegion> is also more specialized than previously suspected. We injected medium spiny neurons in lightly fixed slices of the squirrel monkey <BrainRegion>caudate nucleus</BrainRegion>, reconstructed their dendritic arbors, and analyzed the orientations of these arbors with respect to the cardinal planes of the <BrainRegion>striatum</BrainRegion>. The data were unequivocal in suggesting that many spiny neurons, whether near striosomes or not, have dendritic arbors with preferred orientations along a diagonal axis running from rostral, dorsal, and medial to caudal, ventral, and lateral. This axis corresponds to the orientations of many striosomes and matrisomes in the squirrel monkey&apos;s <BrainRegion>caudate nucleus</BrainRegion>. We therefore suggest that the primate <BrainRegion>striatum</BrainRegion> is characterized not only by a macroscopic organization dividing it into striosomes and matrisomes, but also by a microscopic architecture observed by the dendritic arbors of many of its projection neurons. We obtained comparable supplementary observations for the ferret <BrainRegion>caudate nucleus</BrainRegion>, suggesting that such spatial alignment of spiny dendritic arbors may be a general feature of <BrainRegion>striatal</BrainRegion> organization. These polarized dendritic arrangements could provide a cellular framework for compartmental input-output processing within the <BrainRegion>striatum</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Further evidence for excitatory amino acid transmission in lamprey <BrainRegion>reticulospinal</BrainRegion> neurons: selective retrograde labeling with (3H)D-aspartate.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The distribution of radiolabeled neurons in the <BrainRegion>brain stem</BrainRegion> of Lampetra fluviatilis was studied following unilateral injections of (3H)D-aspartate in the <BrainRegion>rostral spinal cord</BrainRegion>. After survival periods of 1-3 days, labeled perikarya were present within and nearby the <BrainRegion>posterior, middle, and anterior rhombencephalic reticular nuclei</BrainRegion> and in the <BrainRegion>mesencephalic reticular nucleus</BrainRegion>. The highest number of (3H)D-aspartate labeled cell bodies were present in the <BrainRegion>posterior rhombencephalic reticular nucleus</BrainRegion>. The labeled <BrainRegion>reticulospinal</BrainRegion> neurons were distributed mainly ipsilateral to the injection site and included the giant Müller cells as well as medium-sized and small neurons. Contralateral labeling occurred in cell bodies scattered along the lateral margin of the <BrainRegion>rhombencephalic reticular formation</BrainRegion>, the most rostral of these contralaterally projecting neurons being the Mauthner cell. The (3H)D-aspartate labeling correlates with previous electrophysiological studies showing that lamprey <BrainRegion>reticulospinal</BrainRegion> neurons utilize excitatory amino acid transmission.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Up-regulation of <BrainRegion>pituitary</BrainRegion> adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide in urinary bladder pathways after chronic cystitis.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>These studies examined changes in the expression of <BrainRegion>pituitary</BrainRegion> adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) in micturition reflex pathways after chronic cystitis induced by cyclophosphamide (CYP). In control Wistar rats, <BrainRegion>pituitary</BrainRegion> adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide(PACAP) immunoreactivity was expressed in fibers in the <BrainRegion>superficial dorsal horn</BrainRegion> at all segmental levels examined (L1, L2, and L4-S1). Bladder afferent cells (40-45%) in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG; L1, L2, L6, and S1) from control animals also exhibited <BrainRegion>pituitary</BrainRegion> adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide(PACAP) immunoreactivity. After chronic, cyclophosphamide(CYP) -induced cystitis, <BrainRegion>pituitary</BrainRegion> adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide(PACAP) immunoreactivity increased dramatically in <BrainRegion>spinal segments</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>dorsal root ganglia</BrainRegion>(DRG) (L1, L2, L6, and S1) involved in micturition reflexes. The density of <BrainRegion>pituitary</BrainRegion> adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide(PACAP) immunoreactivity was increased in the superficial laminae (I-II) of the L1, L2, L6, and S1 <BrainRegion>spinal segments</BrainRegion>. No changes in <BrainRegion>pituitary</BrainRegion> adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide(PACAP) immunoreactivity were observed in the L4-L5 segments. Staining also increased dramatically in a fiber bundle extending ventrally from Lissauer&apos;s tract in lamina I along the <BrainRegion>lateral edge of the dorsal horn</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>sacral parasympathetic nucleus</BrainRegion> in the L6-S1 <BrainRegion>spinal segments</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>lateral collateral pathway of Lissauer</BrainRegion>). After chronic cystitis, <BrainRegion>pituitary</BrainRegion> adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide(PACAP) immunoreactivity in cells in the L1, L2, L6, and S1 <BrainRegion>dorsal root ganglia</BrainRegion>(DRG) increased significantly (P &amp;lt;/= 0.0001), and the percentage of bladder afferent cells expressing <BrainRegion>pituitary</BrainRegion> adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide(PACAP) immunoreactivity also increased significantly (P &amp;lt;/= 0.0001; 70-85%). No changes were observed in the L3-L5 <BrainRegion>dorsal root ganglia</BrainRegion>(DRG) . These studies suggest that the neuropeptide, <BrainRegion>pituitary</BrainRegion> adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide(PACAP) , may play a role in urinary bladder afferent pathways after visceral (urinary bladder) inflammation. Changes in <BrainRegion>pituitary</BrainRegion> adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide(PACAP) expression after cystitis may play a role in altered visceral sensation (allodynia) and/or urinary bladder hyperreflexia in the clinical syndrome, interstitial cystitis.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Distribution of opiate receptor subtypes and enkephalin and dynorphin immunoreactivity in the <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion> of squirrel, guinea pig, rat, and hamster.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The distribution of enkephalin and dynorphin immunoreactivity in the <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion> of four rodent species (gray squirrel, guinea pig, rat, and hamster) is compared with the pattern of opiate receptor subtypes (mu, delta, and kappa). The distribution of opioid peptides is fairly consistent in the <BrainRegion>anterior hippocampus</BrainRegion> of these four species. Intense immunoreactivity for dynorphin and enkephalin is found in the <BrainRegion>hilus of the dentate gyrus</BrainRegion> and in the mossy fiber system. Occasional immunoreactive processes are seen in the <BrainRegion>dentate</BrainRegion> molecular layer and scattered throughout the <BrainRegion>CA1</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>CA3 fields</BrainRegion>. In the rat and hamster, an additional plexus of enkephalinergic fibers straddles both sides of the <BrainRegion>hippocampal fissure</BrainRegion>. Cells immunoreactive for both opioid peptides are located in and just superficial to the <BrainRegion>dentate</BrainRegion> granule cell layer. Opiate receptors are variably distributed in these rodent species. In the squirrel, guinea pig, and hamster, mu and kappa binding is dense in the <BrainRegion>stratum lucidum of CA3</BrainRegion> and the molecular layer of the <BrainRegion>dentate gyrus</BrainRegion>. In the rat, dense mu and kappa binding is localized within and adjacent to the pyramidal and granule cell layers. Delta receptor patterns show additional species differences. In the rat, the delta distribution is similar to the mu and kappa patterns. In the other species, the delta binding pattern is generally the inverse of the mu/kappa pattern: most areas of the <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion> are enriched in delta sites, whereas the <BrainRegion>stratum lucidum</BrainRegion> and the pyramidal cell layer are receptor-sparse. Thus, the <BrainRegion>stratum lucidum</BrainRegion>--site of dense terminations of mossy fibers containing opioid peptides--is characterized by selectively sparse delta receptors in four species and by selectively dense kappa receptors in three species. The three receptor subtypes, taken either individually or together and compared to the peptides, are more variably and more widely distributed throughout the <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion> and fail to show a correspondence with opioid-peptide-containing terminals. The mismatches suggest that receptor locations and densities are organized without relation to the sites of relevant transmitter release.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Characterization of glucagon-expressing neurons in the chicken <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>We recently identified large glucagon-expressing neurons that densely ramify neurites in the <BrainRegion>peripheral edge of the retina</BrainRegion> and regulate the proliferation of progenitors in the circumferential marginal zone (CMZ) of the postnatal chicken eye (Fischer et al. [2005] J Neurosci 25:10157-10166). However, nothing is known about the transmitters and proteins that are expressed by the glucagon-expressing neurons in the avian <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>. We used antibodies to cell-distinguishing markers to better characterize the different types of glucagon-expressing neurons. We found that the large glucagon-expressing neurons were immunoreactive for substance P, neurofilament, Pax6, AP2alpha, HuD, calretinin, trkB, and trkC. Colocalization of glucagon and substance P in the large glucagon-expressing neurons indicates that these cells are the &quot;bullwhip cells" that have been briefly described by Ehrlich et al. ([1987] J Comp Neurol 266:220-233). Similar to the bullwhip cells, the conventional glucagon-expressing amacrine cells were immunoreactive for calretinin, HuD, Pax6, and AP2alpha. Unlike bullwhip cells, the conventional glucagon-expressing amacrine cells were immunoreactive for GABA. While glucagon-immunoreactive amacrine cells were negative for substance P in <BrainRegion>central regions of the retina</BrainRegion>, a subset of this type of amacrine cell was immunoreactive for substance P in far <BrainRegion>peripheral regions of the retina</BrainRegion>. An additional type of glucagon/substance P-expressing neuron, resembling the bullwhip cells, was found in far <BrainRegion>peripheral and dorsal regions of the retina</BrainRegion>. Based on morphology, distribution within the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>, and histological markers, we conclude that there may be four different types of glucagon-expressing neurons in the avian <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>The <BrainRegion>pontocerebellar</BrainRegion> system in the rat: an HRP study. II. Hemispheral components.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The projection of <BrainRegion>basilar pontine</BrainRegion> neurons to the <BrainRegion>cerebellar hemispheres</BrainRegion> was studied to pigmented rats by means of the retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase. Injections of horseradish peroxidase were restricted to the lateral aspects of the <BrainRegion>lobulus simplex</BrainRegion> (11 cases), <BrainRegion>crus I</BrainRegion> (26 cases), <BrainRegion>crus II</BrainRegion> (23 cases), and <BrainRegion>paramedian lobule</BrainRegion> (18 cases). The main focus of labeled neurons following <BrainRegion>lobulus simplex</BrainRegion> injections of horseradish peroxidase was located in the <BrainRegion>ventral pons</BrainRegion>, at rostral levels. Interestingly, the majority of labeled cells were distributed ipsilateral to the injection site. After <BrainRegion>crus I</BrainRegion> injections, however, labeled neurons were most evident contralaterally , although labeled ipsilateral cells were conspicuous rostrally. The majority of labeled cells were characteristically distributed along the <BrainRegion>medial, ventral, and lateral perimeters of the pontine gray</BrainRegion>. This pattern of labeling contrasts with that in cases of <BrainRegion>crus II</BrainRegion> injections, in which the main focus of labeled somata occupied more <BrainRegion>central regions of medial and ventral portions of the pons</BrainRegion>. Similarly, the pattern of labeling following injections into the <BrainRegion>paramedian lobule</BrainRegion> largely avoided the <BrainRegion>medial and lateral perimeters of the pontine gray</BrainRegion>, while numerous labeled somata occupied the <BrainRegion>central region of the pons</BrainRegion>. In addition to the <BrainRegion>pontine regions</BrainRegion> described above, labeled cells were observed in various cases in the <BrainRegion>dorsal peduncular region</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>lateral and dorsolateral areas</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>nuclear reticularis tegmenti pontis</BrainRegion> (NRTP) where three separate zones of labeling could be discerned in various cases. Several general organizational features were derived from these studies. Although specific quantitation procedures were not applied, the number of ipsilaterally labeled neurons was impressive in some cases, as was the mirror-image location of certain ipsi- and contralateral cell clusters. It was also noted that certain, similarly located clusters of labeled <BrainRegion>pontine</BrainRegion> neurons were present in cases in which injections were made into different <BrainRegion>cerebellar lobules</BrainRegion>, at least raising the possibility that some <BrainRegion>pontine</BrainRegion> neurons might give rise to divergent projections of multiple <BrainRegion>cerebellar</BrainRegion> locations, Moreover, it was evident that the location of certain clusters of labeled neurons was congruent with terminal zones of various <BrainRegion>pontine</BrainRegion> afferent systems, particularly those of the <BrainRegion>sensorimotor cortex</BrainRegion>. Combining the latter finding with the preceeding notion regarding <BrainRegion>pontocerebellar</BrainRegion> divergence suggests a mechanism by which sensorimotor information might be transmitted to several different <BrainRegion>cerebellar</BrainRegion> locations.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>An X-ray diffraction comparison of myelins from the human nervous system.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Earlier small-angle X-ray diffraction studies have indicated that central and peripheral nerve myelins may be significantly different structurally, although relatively few examples for each system and for individual species have been examined. In order to understand better the intra- and inter-system relationships, this study has developed more extensive information for a single species: six cases centrally and ten peripherally, featuring cranial nerves and a few others of the human nervous system. Peripheral myelin spacings (membrane pair thicknesses) are relatively similar, 184.4 +/- 1.40 A, and the ratios of diffraction peak height intensities of the second to fourth orders are also closely bunched: 1.85 +/- 0.216. Central myelin spacings and intensity ratios are distinctly different and more variable: spacings 160.3-165.8 A and intensity ratios 2.81-4.46. It appears that within a given species or between closely related (e.g., mammalian) species peripheral myelins possess relatively invariant structures, though significant spacing declines are encountered for both systems as phylogenetic relationships become more distant. The observed greater variability of CNS structures within a single species may correspond to known compositional differences between CNS regions or result from observational difficulties. In any case there is a marked discontinuity between the myelin structures of CNS and PNS nerves.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Arborisation and termination of single motor thalamocortical axons in the rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The aim of this study was to examine the arborisations and terminations of individual thalamocortical axons in the motor system of the rat. Small, extracellular injections of an anterograde tracer (dextran-biotin) were made into the <BrainRegion>ventrolateral (VL) or ventral posterolateral (VPL) thalamic nuclei</BrainRegion> to label thalamocortical projections. Eleven motor axons and one somatosensory axon were reconstructed through serial sections just rostral from the injection site to their terminations in <BrainRegion>sensorimotor cortex</BrainRegion>. The smallest arbor arising from a single motor axon extended approximately 0.9 mm rostrocaudal and 0.9 mm mediolateral, the largest extended 3.9 mm rostrocaudal and 1.0 mm mediolateral. In some cases, two distinct plexuses of terminals were formed by an axon. In addition, motor axons formed terminals in <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> layer V only or in layers I, III, and V. By contrast (and in keeping with previous reports), the somatosensory axon formed a single plexus of terminals in layer IV of the <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion> that extended approximately 0.3 mm rostrocaudal and 0.4 mm mediolateral. It is concluded that individual motor thalamocortical neurones are in a position to influence much more widespread <BrainRegion>cortical regions</BrainRegion> than somatosensory thalamocortical neurones.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Comparative localization of two serotonin receptors and sensorin in the central nervous system of Aplysia californica.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Aplysia californica is a powerful model for understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying modulation of neuronal plasticity and learning. In the central nervous system of Aplysia, serotonin is associated with various behaviors. For example, it induces short-, intermediate-, and long-term synaptic changes in sensory neurons during learning and inhibits the afterdischarge of the bag cells that initiate egg-laying behavior. Little is known about the nature and contribution of serotonin receptors involved in the numerous serotonin-mediated physiological responses in Aplysia. Recently, two G(i)-coupled serotonin receptors (5-HT(ap1) and 5-HT(ap2)) were cloned. We now report that, by using in situ hybridization to express the profile of these receptors, we are able to gain critical insight into their roles in the behavior of Aplysia. We compared their distribution to that of sensorin-A, a peptide specifically found in sensory neurons. We wished to determine their involvement in some simple forms of behavioral modifications. 5-HT(ap1) and 5-HT(ap2) mRNAs are expressed in all ganglia of the Aplysia central nervous system. Stronger signal was observed with the 5-HT(ap2) antisense probe than with the 5-HT(ap1) antisense probe. Notably, mRNA coding for the receptors was found in several identified neurons, in the bag cells, in characterized serotonergic neurons, and in neurons of the mechanosensory clusters that expressed sensorin. We also observed heterogeneity of receptor expression between R2 and LPl1 and among neurons of a single cluster of sensory neurons. These results suggest that 5-HT(ap1) and 5-HT(ap2) receptors may regulate the response to serotonin and/or its release in several neurons.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Synapses from <BrainRegion>medial olivocochlear</BrainRegion> branches in the <BrainRegion>inferior vestibular nucleus</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Olivocochlear neurons are auditory efferent neurons that convey information from the <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion> to the auditory periphery. With light and electron microscopy, using mice, we studied the central branches of <BrainRegion>medial olivocochlear</BrainRegion> neurons that are given off to the <BrainRegion>inferior vestibular nucleus</BrainRegion>. At the level of the electron microscope, the branches form synapses. The synapses are asymmetric with round vesicles, suggesting that they are excitatory. The synapses are formed mainly onto neuronal dendrites. These dendrites have a large range of diameters, and they may emanate from several types of target neurons. These results indicate that the <BrainRegion>inferior vestibular nucleus</BrainRegion> is an integrating center for vestibular, auditory, and other types of information, but the results do not fit with current theories about the function of the <BrainRegion>olivocochlear system</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Evaluation of the activity of chemically identified enteric neurons through the histochemical demonstration of cytochrome oxidase.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The measurement of the density of the reaction product produced by the histochemical demonstration of cytochrome oxidase activity provides a method for the visual identification of physiologically active enteric neurons. The current study utilized the cytochrome oxidase technique in order to evaluate the metabolic history of neurons in different regions of the bowel and in chemically identified types of neuron. In addition, the effect of drugs or neurotoxins commonly used in the immunocytochemical identification of enteric neuronal phenotypes was also analyzed. Cytochrome oxidase activity was visualized with a blue-black reaction product resulting from the cobalt-intensified oxidation of 3,3&apos;-diaminobenzidine. Peptides or 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) were localized with biotinylated secondary antibodies and alkaline phosphatase-labeled avidin. Bound avidin or endogenous alkaline phosphatase was visualized with a red reaction product in the presence or absence, respectively, of levamisole. Use of measured without interference from a simultaneously demonstrated histo- or immunochemical marker. A multi-peptidergic class of cholinergic submucosal secretomotor neuron containing neuropeptide Y (NPY) and calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) immunoreactivities was found to be less metabolically active than the average of all submucosal neurons. In contrast, a non-cholinergic submucosal secretomotor neuron containing dynorphin (which is also known to contain vasoactive intestinal peptide) immunoreactivity was more metabolically active than submucosal neurons that do not contain this peptide. On average, submucosal neurons were more metabolically active than those of the myenteric plexus, and levels of metabolic activity in the myenteric plexus were found to be higher in the duodenum and the cecum than in the jejunum-ileum or colon. Myenteric neurons characterized by calcitonin gene related peptide(CGRP) or neuropeptide Y(NPY) immunoreactivities or by endogenous alkaline phosphatase activity, were all less metabolically active than the average of all neurons in myenteric ganglia. Colchicine, which stimulates intestinal motility, was observed to increase cytochrome oxidase activity in enteric neurons, suggesting that an effect on the enteric nervous system contributes to its action on the bowel. The neurotoxins, 6-hydroxydopamine and 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT) were each found to stimulate neuronal metabolic activity. 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine(5,7-DHT) appeared to activate excitatory subtypes of 5-hydroxytryptamine(5-HT) receptor since its effects were blocked or mimicked by compounds that act as antagonists or agonists, respectively, at these receptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Origin of <BrainRegion>cerebellar</BrainRegion> projections to the region of the <BrainRegion>oculomotor complex</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>medial pontine reticular formation</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion> in New World monkeys: a retrograde horseradish peroxidase study.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText><BrainRegion>Cerebellar</BrainRegion> projections to <BrainRegion>oculomotor-related brainstem regions</BrainRegion> were studied in four groups of New World (capuchin, squirrel) monkeys by using the retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) to determine the origin of the principal <BrainRegion>cerebellar</BrainRegion> influence on eye movement. Group A monkeys had horseradish peroxidase(HRP) injections or transcannular horseradish peroxidase(HRP) gel implants into the <BrainRegion>oculomotor complex</BrainRegion> (OMC), the largest of which involved adjacent <BrainRegion>paraoculomotor nuclei</BrainRegion> (e.g., <BrainRegion>ventral periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion>, PAG; <BrainRegion>nucleus of Darkschewitsch</BrainRegion>, ND; <BrainRegion>medial accessory nucleus of Bechterew</BrainRegion>, MAB; <BrainRegion>dorsomedial parvicellular red nucleus</BrainRegion>, dmPRN). All of these cases contained large numbers of retrogradely labeled cells in cell group Y. Whereas the smallest <BrainRegion>oculomotor complex</BrainRegion>(OMC) injection only labeled a few cells in the <BrainRegion>dentate nucleus</BrainRegion> (DN), injections involving <BrainRegion>paraoculomotor nuclei</BrainRegion> produced labeling in all of the <BrainRegion>cerebellar nuclei</BrainRegion> except the <BrainRegion>basal interstitial nucleus</BrainRegion> (BIN). Injections extending into the <BrainRegion>ND</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>MAB</BrainRegion> produced particularly heavy labeling within the <BrainRegion>interposed nuclei</BrainRegion>. Group B monkeys had injections/implants into the <BrainRegion>medial pontine tegmentum</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>dorsomedial basilar pons</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>pontine</BrainRegion> tegmental cases contained labeled cells in all <BrainRegion>cerebellar nuclei</BrainRegion>, but the <BrainRegion>dentate nucleus</BrainRegion>(DN) was the most heavily labeled when the implant involved the <BrainRegion>nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis</BrainRegion> (NRTP). Cases with injections into the <BrainRegion>caudal medial pontine tegmentum</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>nucleus reticularis pontis caudalis</BrainRegion>, NRPC), including the physiological <BrainRegion>paramedian pontine reticular formation</BrainRegion> (PPRF), but not <BrainRegion>nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis</BrainRegion>(NRTP) , contained the largest number of labeled cells in the <BrainRegion>fastigial nucleus</BrainRegion> (FN) and lacked retrograde labeling in the <BrainRegion>dentate nucleus</BrainRegion>(DN) . <BrainRegion>Dorsomedial basilar pontine</BrainRegion> cases contained almost no labeled cells in the <BrainRegion>fastigial nucleus</BrainRegion>(FN) , <BrainRegion>anterior interpositus nucleus</BrainRegion> (AIN), and <BrainRegion>posterior interpositus nucleus</BrainRegion> (PIN) but did contain <BrainRegion>dentate nucleus</BrainRegion>(DN) labeling when the injection involved the <BrainRegion>nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis</BrainRegion>(NRTP) . Two <BrainRegion>dorsomedial pontine tegmental</BrainRegion> cases and one <BrainRegion>dorsomedial basilar pontine</BrainRegion> case had more labeled cells in the <BrainRegion>basal interstitial nucleus</BrainRegion>(BIN) than in other cases. <BrainRegion>Tegmental</BrainRegion> cases also contained a few labeled cells in cell group Y. Group C monkeys had injections into the <BrainRegion>parvicellular red nucleus</BrainRegion> ( <BrainRegion>parvicellular red nucleus</BrainRegion>(PRN) ) and had their heaviest labeling in the <BrainRegion>dentate nucleus</BrainRegion>(DN) , although the <BrainRegion>anterior interpositus nucleus</BrainRegion>(AIN) and <BrainRegion>posterior interpositus nucleus</BrainRegion>(PIN) also contained labeled cells. The <BrainRegion>fastigial nucleus</BrainRegion>(FN) , <BrainRegion>basal interstitial nucleus</BrainRegion>(BIN) , and cell group Y, on the other hand, contained almost no labeling. Group D consisted of monkeys which had injections into the intermediate and deep <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion> (SC). These cases contained the largest numbers of labeled cells in the <BrainRegion>posterior interpositus nucleus</BrainRegion>(PIN) and a lesser number in the <BrainRegion>ventrolateral fastigial nucleus</BrainRegion>(FN) . The <BrainRegion>dentate nucleus</BrainRegion>(DN) , <BrainRegion>anterior interpositus nucleus</BrainRegion>(AIN) , <BrainRegion>basal interstitial nucleus</BrainRegion>(BIN) , and cell group Y lacked labeled neurons in these cases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Patterns of extraocular innervation by the <BrainRegion>oculomotor complex</BrainRegion> in the chick.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The horseradish peroxidase retrograde tracer technique was used to map the projection pattern of the <BrainRegion>oculomotor nuclear complex</BrainRegion> to the extraocular muscles in the chick embryo. The following projection pattern was found: The <BrainRegion>dorsolateral oculomotor subnucleus</BrainRegion> innervates the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral inferior rectus muscle</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>dorsomedial subnucleus</BrainRegion> innervates the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral medial rectus muscle</BrainRegion>, a <BrainRegion>lateral division of the ventromedial subnucleus</BrainRegion> innervates the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral inferior oblique muscle</BrainRegion>, and a <BrainRegion>medial division of the ventromedial subnucleus</BrainRegion> innervates the <BrainRegion>contralateral superior rectus muscle</BrainRegion>. The so-called <BrainRegion>central nucleus</BrainRegion> also innervates the <BrainRegion>contralateral superior rectus muscle</BrainRegion>. This pattern was extremely discrete, with virtually no overlapping representations. These results provide the first evidence for a functional <BrainRegion>medial-lateral subdivision of the ventromedial subnucleus</BrainRegion>. This pattern relates to the unusual development of this subnucleus and suggests that only part of the primordium for this cell group migrates across the midline during its ontogeny, rather than all of it, as was previously believed. The subnuclear organization of the avian <BrainRegion>oculomotor complex</BrainRegion> is also considered in comparison to such functional organization in other species.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Expression of VIP and/or PACAP receptor mRNA in peptide synthesizing cells within the <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion> of the rat and in its efferent target sites.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion> (SCN) contains the predominant circadian pacemaker in mammals. Considerable evidence indicates that VPAC(2) and PAC(1), receptors for vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and <BrainRegion>pituitary</BrainRegion> adenylate cyclase-activating peptide (PACAP), play critical roles in maintaining and entraining circadian rhythms. <BrainRegion>Retinal</BrainRegion> projections to the rat <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion>(SCN) contain <BrainRegion>pituitary</BrainRegion> adenylate cyclase-activating peptide(PACAP) and terminate mostly in the <BrainRegion>ventral suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion>(SCN) , the site of vasoactive intestinal peptide(VIP) neurons. The incidence of VPAC(2) and PAC(1) mRNAs within distinct neuronal populations of the rat <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion>(SCN) has been determined using double-label in situ hybridization. VPAC(2) mRNA was detected in almost all arginine-vasopressin (AVP) neurons of the <BrainRegion>dorsomedial suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion>(SCN) and in 41% of the vasoactive intestinal peptide(VIP) neurons; somatostatin (SST) neurons, predominantly in dorsomedial and intermediate regions, showed a decreased incidence (23%). PAC(1) mRNA was present in nearly half of the vasoactive intestinal peptide(VIP) and somatostatin(SST) neurons (45% and 40%, respectively) and in one-third of the arginine-vasopressin(AVP) neurons (32%). Cells expressing VPAC(2) mRNA also were detected in <BrainRegion>diencephalic areas</BrainRegion> that receive vasoactive intestinal peptide(VIP) -immunoreactive <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion>(SCN) efferents, such as the <BrainRegion>peri-suprachiasmatic region</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>lateral subparaventricular zone</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>parvocellular hypothalamic paraventricular subdivisions</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>anterior thalamic paraventricular and paratenial nuclei</BrainRegion>. The extensive distribution of PAC(1) mRNA within the <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion>(SCN) suggests that actions of <BrainRegion>pituitary</BrainRegion> adenylate cyclase-activating peptide(PACAP) are not restricted to the predominantly <BrainRegion>retinorecipient region</BrainRegion>. The presence of VPAC(2) mRNA in nearly half the vasoactive intestinal peptide(VIP) neurons, in almost all the arginine-vasopressin(AVP) neurons, and at sites receiving vasoactive intestinal peptide(VIP) -immunoreactive <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion>(SCN) efferents suggests that the <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion>(SCN) vasoactive intestinal peptide(VIP) neurons are coupled and/or autoregulated and also influence the arginine-vasopressin(AVP) -containing <BrainRegion>dorsomedial suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion>(SCN) and distal sites via VPAC(2).</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Frontal eye field</BrainRegion> efferents in the macaque monkey: I. <BrainRegion>Subcortical</BrainRegion> pathways and topography of <BrainRegion>striatal and thalamic terminal fields</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Anterograde tracers (tritiated leucine, proline, fucose; WGA-HRP) were injected into sites within the <BrainRegion>frontal eye fields</BrainRegion> (FEF) of nine macaque monkeys. Low thresholds (less than or equal to 50 microA) for electrically evoking saccadic eye movements were used to locate injection sites in four monkeys. Cases were grouped according to the amplitude of saccades evoked or predicted at the injection site. <BrainRegion>Dorsomedial prearcuate</BrainRegion> injection sites where large saccades were elicited were classified as <BrainRegion>l frontal eye fields</BrainRegion>(FEF) cases, whereas <BrainRegion>ventrolateral prearcuate</BrainRegion> sites where small saccades were evoked were designated <BrainRegion>s frontal eye fields</BrainRegion>(FEF) cases. One control case was injected in the <BrainRegion>medial postarcuate area 6</BrainRegion>. We found five descending fiber bundles from <BrainRegion>frontal eye fields</BrainRegion>(FEF) ; fibers to the <BrainRegion>striatum</BrainRegion>, which enter the <BrainRegion>caudate nucleus</BrainRegion> at or just rostral to the genu of the <BrainRegion>internal capsule</BrainRegion>; fibers to the <BrainRegion>claustrum</BrainRegion>, which travel in the <BrainRegion>external capsule</BrainRegion>; and <BrainRegion>transthalamic</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>subthalamic</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>pedunculopontine</BrainRegion> fibers. Our results indicate that <BrainRegion>transthalamic and subthalamic pathways</BrainRegion> supply all terminal sites in the <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>subthalamus</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>tegmentum of the midbrain</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>pons</BrainRegion>, whereas <BrainRegion>pedunculopontine</BrainRegion> fibers appear to terminate in the <BrainRegion>pontine</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>reticularis tegmenti pontis nucleus</BrainRegion> exclusively. <BrainRegion>Frontal eye field</BrainRegion> terminal fields in the <BrainRegion>striatum</BrainRegion> were topographically organized: <BrainRegion>l frontal eye fields</BrainRegion>(FEF) projections terminated dorsal and rostral to <BrainRegion>s frontal eye fields</BrainRegion>(FEF) projections. Thus, <BrainRegion>l frontal eye fields</BrainRegion>(FEF) terminal fields were located centrally in the head and body of the <BrainRegion>caudate nucleus</BrainRegion> and a small <BrainRegion>dorsomedial portion of the putamen</BrainRegion>, whereas <BrainRegion>s frontal eye fields</BrainRegion>(FEF) terminal fields were located in <BrainRegion>ventrolateral parts of the caudate body</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>ventromedial parts of the putamen</BrainRegion>. In the <BrainRegion>claustrum</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>l frontal eye fields</BrainRegion>(FEF) <BrainRegion>projections</BrainRegion> terminated <BrainRegion>dorsal and rostral to s frontal eye fields</BrainRegion>(FEF) projections. Projections from <BrainRegion>frontal eye fields</BrainRegion>(FEF) terminated in <BrainRegion>ventral and caudal parts of the subthalamic nucleus</BrainRegion> without a clear topography. By comparison, terminal fields from <BrainRegion>medial postarcuate area 6</BrainRegion> were located more caudally and laterally in the <BrainRegion>striatum</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>claustrum</BrainRegion> than projections from <BrainRegion>frontal eye fields</BrainRegion>(FEF) , and more centrally in the <BrainRegion>subthalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>. In the <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>frontal eye fields</BrainRegion>(FEF) terminal patches in some <BrainRegion>thalamic nuclei</BrainRegion> were also topographically organized. Projections from <BrainRegion>l frontal eye fields</BrainRegion>(FEF) terminated in <BrainRegion>dorsal area X</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>dorsolateral medial dorsal nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>pars parvicellularis (MDpc)</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>caudal pole of MDpc</BrainRegion>, whereas projections from <BrainRegion>s frontal eye fields</BrainRegion>(FEF) terminated in <BrainRegion>ventral area X</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>medial dorsal nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>pars multiformis</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>caudal medial dorsal nucleus pars densocellularis</BrainRegion>.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Relative distribution of synapses in the A-laminae of the <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion> of the cat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Previous electron microscopic studies of synaptic terminal distributions in the <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion> have been flawed by potential sampling biases favoring larger synapses. We have thus re-investigated this in the <BrainRegion>geniculate</BrainRegion> A-laminae of the cat with an algorithm to correct this sampling bias. We used serial reconstructions with the electron microscope to determine the size of each terminal and synaptic type. We observed that RL (retinal) terminals are largest, F (local, GABAergic, inhibitory) terminals are intermediate in size, and RS (<BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion>) terminals are smallest. We also found that synapses from RL terminals are largest, and thus most oversampled, and we used synaptic size data to correct for sampling errors. Doing so, we found that the relative synaptic percentages overall are 11.7% for RL terminals, 27.5% for F, and 60.8% for RS. Furthermore, we distinguished between relay cells and interneurons with post-embedding immunocytochemistry for GABA (relay cells are GABA negative and interneurons are GABA positive). Onto relay cells, RL terminals contributed 7.1%, F terminals contributed 30.9%, and RS terminals contributed 62.0%. Onto interneurons, RL terminals contributed 48.7%, F terminals contributed 24.4%, and RS terminals contributed 26.9%. We also found that RL terminals included many more separate synaptic contact zones (9.1 +/- 1.6) than did F terminals (2.6 +/- 0.2) or RS terminals (1.02 +/- 0.02). We used these data plus the calculation of overall percentages of each synaptic type to compute the relative percentage of each terminal type in the neuropil: RL terminals represent 1.8%, F terminals represent 14.5%, and RS terminals represent 83.7%. We argue that this relative synaptic paucity is typical for driver inputs (from <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>), whereas modulator inputs (all others) require many more synapses to achieve their function.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Collateral sprouting of insect motorneurons.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The metathoracic extensor tibiae muscle of the cricket, Teleogryllus oceanicus, is innervated by two excitatory axons: a fast axon, which initiates large twitches to single stimuli, and a slow axon, which evokes minute twitches to single stimuli, but which, through facilitation and summation, evokes readily measurable tension to repetitive stimulation. The fast axon and the slow axon leave the metathoracic ganglia in different nerve roots, the fast axon through nerve 5 and the slow axon through nerve 3. The fast axon innervates muscle fibers in the middle of the extensor tibiae, and the slow axon innervates muscle fibers at the proximal and distal ends of the muscle. A central region of muscle fibers is innervated by only the fast axon. This region is flanked on either side by dually innervated fibers, fibers that receive both the fast and the slow axons. Fibers with only slow axon innervation are restricted to a wedge-shaped patch in the proximal extensor tibiae and a larger region in the most distal portion of the muscle. Sectioning nerve 5 containing the fast axon, or nerve 3 containing the slow axon, partially denervates the extensor tibiae. Functional transmission by the fast axon fails 7-10 days after nerve section. The innervation field of the intact motorneuron expands in a partially denervated muscle. The linear expansion rate of the slow axon field is about 20-40 micrometer per day. The enlarged slow field does not regress when axons regenerate to the muscle through nerve 5. The progressive expansion of the slow innervation field suggests that the expansion is due to collateral sprouting of slow axon terminals.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Mediodorsal nucleus</BrainRegion>: areal, laminar, and tangential distribution of afferents and efferents in the <BrainRegion>frontal lobe</BrainRegion> of rhesus monkeys.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The terminal distribution of <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> afferents in primate <BrainRegion>prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion> has never been examined in any detail. In the present study, WGA-HRP was injected into major <BrainRegion>subdivisions of the mediodorsal nucleus</BrainRegion> (MD) in the rhesus monkey in order to determine 1) The areal distribution of <BrainRegion>mediodorsal nucleus</BrainRegion>(MD) projections, 2) the layer(s) in which <BrainRegion>mediodorsal nucleus</BrainRegion>(MD) afferents terminate, 3) the tangential pattern of the <BrainRegion>mediodorsal nucleus</BrainRegion>(MD) axonal terminals, 4) the cells of origin of the reciprocal corticothalamic pathway, and 5) the degree of reciprocity between the corticothalamic and thalamocortical pathways in the different regions of the <BrainRegion>prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion>. As expected on the basis of retrograde degeneration and transport studies, injections centered in the <BrainRegion>magnocellular ( mediodorsal nucleus(MD) mc) subnucleus of mediodorsal nucleus</BrainRegion>(MD) labeled cells and terminals in the <BrainRegion>ventral and medial prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion>. Injections involving <BrainRegion>ventral mediodorsal nucleus(MD) mc</BrainRegion> labeled the more lateral of these areas (<BrainRegion>Walker&apos;s areas 11 and 12</BrainRegion>); injections of the <BrainRegion>dorsal mediodorsal nucleus(MD) mc</BrainRegion> labeled the <BrainRegion>ventromedial regions</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>areas 13 and 14</BrainRegion>). In contrast, injections involving mainly the lateral, <BrainRegion>parvicellular ( mediodorsal nucleus(MD) pc</BrainRegion>) moiety labeled cells and terminals in <BrainRegion>dorsolateral and dorsomedial areas</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>Walker&apos;s 46, 9, and 8B</BrainRegion>). <BrainRegion>Area 8A</BrainRegion> was labeled most prominently when injections included the <BrainRegion>multiform portion of mediodorsal nucleus</BrainRegion>(MD) ( <BrainRegion>mediodorsal nucleus(MD) mf</BrainRegion>) and <BrainRegion>area 10</BrainRegion> had connections with <BrainRegion>anterior portions of mediodorsal nucleus</BrainRegion>(MD) . A dorsal-ventral topography for <BrainRegion>mediodorsal nucleus(MD) pc</BrainRegion> exists with <BrainRegion>dorsal mediodorsal nucleus(MD) pc</BrainRegion> labeling <BrainRegion>dorsal and dorsomedial prefrontal areas</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>ventral mediodorsal nucleus(MD) pc</BrainRegion> labeling <BrainRegion>dorsolateral prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion>. Our findings with respect to <BrainRegion>mediodorsal nucleus</BrainRegion>(MD) are consistent with a nucleus-to-field organization of its thalamocortical projection system. Outside of the traditional boundaries of <BrainRegion>prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>lateral mediodorsal nucleus</BrainRegion>(MD) projections extended to the <BrainRegion>supplementary motor area</BrainRegion> (SMA) and the <BrainRegion>dorsal part of the anterior cingulate</BrainRegion> (AC) whereas the <BrainRegion>medial mediodorsal nucleus</BrainRegion>(MD) projection targeted the <BrainRegion>ventromedial cingulate cortex</BrainRegion> and spared <BrainRegion>supplementary motor area</BrainRegion>(SMA) . In addition, a few labeled cells and sparse terminals were found in the <BrainRegion>inferior parietal lobule</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>superior temporal sulcus</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>anterior part of the insula</BrainRegion> after injections that involved the <BrainRegion>medial part of mediodorsal nucleus</BrainRegion>(MD) . Labeled terminals were invariably confined to layer IV and adjacent deep layer III.

<ArticleTitle>Characterization of neuropeptide Y2 receptor protein expression in the mouse brain. I. Distribution in cell bodies and nerve terminals.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Neuropeptide Y (NPY), a 36-amino-acid peptide, mediates biological effects by activating Y1, Y2, Y5, and y6 receptors. Neuropeptide Y(NPY) neurons innervate many brain regions, including the <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion>, where Neuropeptide Y(NPY) is involved in regulation of a broad range of homeostatic functions. We examined, by immunohistochemistry with tyramide signal amplification, the expression of the Neuropeptide Y(NPY) Y2 receptor (Y2R) in the mouse brain with a newly developed rabbit polyclonal antibody. Y2 receptor(Y2R) immunoreactivity was specific with its absence in Y2 receptor(Y2R) knockout (KO) mice and in adjacent sections following preadsorption with the immunogenic peptide (10(-5) M). Y2 receptor(Y2R) -positive processes were located in many brain regions, including the <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>, some <BrainRegion>cortical areas</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>septum</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>basal forebrain</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>nucleus accumbens</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>amygdala</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>substantia nigra compacta</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>locus coeruleus</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>solitary tract nucleus</BrainRegion>. However, colchicine treatment was needed to detect Y2 receptor(Y2R) -like immunoreactivity in cell bodies in many, but not all, areas. The densest distributions of cell bodies were located in the <BrainRegion>septum basal forebrain</BrainRegion>, including the <BrainRegion>bed nucleus</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>amygdala</BrainRegion>, with lower density in the <BrainRegion>anterior olfactory nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>nucleus accumbens</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>caudal striatum</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>CA1</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>CA2</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>CA3</BrainRegion> <BrainRegion>hippocampal fields</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>preoptic nuclei lateral hypothalamus</BrainRegion>, and A13 DA cells. The widespread distribution of Y2 receptor(Y2R) -positive cell bodies and fibers suggests that Neuropeptide Y(NPY) signaling through the Y2 receptor(Y2R) is common in the mouse brain. Localization of the Y2 receptor(Y2R) suggests that it is mostly presynaptic, a view supported by its frequent absence in cell bodies in the normal mouse and its dramatic increase in cell bodies of colchicine-treated mice.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Distribution of input and output synapses on the central branches of bushcricket and cricket auditory afferent neurones: immunocytochemical evidence for GABA and glutamate in different populations of presynaptic boutons.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>In order to investigate the synapses on the terminals of <BrainRegion>primary auditory</BrainRegion> afferents in the bushcricket and cricket, these were impaled with microelectrodes and after physiological characterisation, injected intracellularly with horseradish peroxidase. The tissue was prepared for electron microscopy, and immunocytochemistry for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate was carried out on ultrathin sections by using a post-embedding immunogold technique. The afferent terminals received many input synapses. Between 60-65% of these were made by processes immunoreactive for gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) and approximately 25% from processes immunoreactive for glutamate. The relative distribution of the different classes of input were analysed from serial section reconstruction of terminal afferent branches. Inputs from gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) and glutamate-immunoreactive processes appeared to be scattered at random over the terminal arborisation of the afferents both with respect to each other and to the architecture of the terminals. They were, however, always found close to the output synapses. The possible roles of presynaptic inhibition in the auditory afferents is discussed in the context of the auditory responses of the animals.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Orbitomedial prefrontal cortical</BrainRegion> projections to <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion> in the rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>A previous study in the rat revealed that distinct <BrainRegion>orbital and medial prefrontal cortical</BrainRegion> (OMPFC) areas projected to specific columns of the midbrain <BrainRegion>periaqueductal gray region</BrainRegion> (PAG). This study used anterograde tracing techniques to define projections to the <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion> arising from the same <BrainRegion>orbital and medial prefrontal cortical</BrainRegion>(OMPFC) regions. In addition, injections of anterograde and retrograde tracers were made into different <BrainRegion>periaqueductal gray region</BrainRegion>(PAG) columns to examine connections between <BrainRegion>hypothalamic regions</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>periaqueductal gray region</BrainRegion>(PAG) columns projected upon by the same <BrainRegion>orbital and medial prefrontal cortical</BrainRegion>(OMPFC) regions. The most extensive patterns of <BrainRegion>hypothalamic</BrainRegion> termination were seen after injection of anterograde tracer in <BrainRegion>prelimbic and infralimbic</BrainRegion> (PL/IL) and the <BrainRegion>ventral and medial orbital (VO/MO) cortices</BrainRegion>. Projections from <BrainRegion>rostral prelimbic and infralimbic</BrainRegion>(PL/IL) and <BrainRegion>VO/MO</BrainRegion> targeted the rostrocaudal extent of the <BrainRegion>lateral hypothalamus</BrainRegion>, as well as <BrainRegion>lateral perifornical</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>dorsal and posterior hypothalamic areas</BrainRegion>. Projections arising from <BrainRegion>caudal prelimbic and infralimbic</BrainRegion>(PL/IL) terminated within the <BrainRegion>dorsal hypothalamus</BrainRegion>, including the <BrainRegion>dorsomedial nucleus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>dorsal and posterior hypothalamic areas</BrainRegion>. There were also projections to <BrainRegion>medial perifornical</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>lateral hypothalamic areas</BrainRegion>. In contrast, it was found that <BrainRegion>anterior cingulate</BrainRegion> (AC), <BrainRegion>dorsolateral orbital</BrainRegion> (DLO), and <BrainRegion>agranular insular (AId) cortices</BrainRegion> projected to distinct and restricted <BrainRegion>hypothalamic regions</BrainRegion>. Projections arising from <BrainRegion>anterior cingulate</BrainRegion>(AC) terminated within <BrainRegion>dorsal and posterior hypothalamic areas</BrainRegion>, whereas <BrainRegion>dorsolateral orbital</BrainRegion>(DLO) and <BrainRegion>AId</BrainRegion> projected to the <BrainRegion>lateral hypothalamus</BrainRegion>. The same <BrainRegion>orbital and medial prefrontal cortical</BrainRegion>(OMPFC) regions also projected indirectly, by means of specific <BrainRegion>periaqueductal gray region</BrainRegion>(PAG) columns, to many of the same <BrainRegion>hypothalamic fields</BrainRegion>. In the context of our previous findings, these data indicate that, in both rat and macaque, parallel but distinct circuits interconnect <BrainRegion>orbital and medial prefrontal cortical</BrainRegion>(OMPFC) areas with specific <BrainRegion>hypothalamic regions</BrainRegion>, as well as <BrainRegion>periaqueductal gray region</BrainRegion>(PAG) columns.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Postnatal development of the <BrainRegion>inferior olivary complex</BrainRegion> in the rat. II. Topographic organization of the immature olivocerebellar projection.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The state of organization of the olivocerebellar projection in newborn and 5-day-old rats has been analyzed by autoradiography of anterogradely transported 3H-leucine, as well as by retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase. The efferent axons of the <BrainRegion>inferior olivary</BrainRegion> neurons are already present and already highly organized in the <BrainRegion>cerebellum</BrainRegion> of newborn rats. Most of the autoradiographic labelling subsequent to the injection of 3H-leucine into the <BrainRegion>inferior olive</BrainRegion> is seen in the <BrainRegion>subcortical medullary zone</BrainRegion>. Labelled axons only partially invade the gray matter, where they reach the zone occupied by randomly distributed Purkinje cells. At this immature stage, olivocerebellar projections are already entirely crossed and distributed according to a pattern which is similar to the adult. At the fifth postnatal day olivocerebellar projections have moved from the <BrainRegion>medullary zone</BrainRegion> toward the interface between the molecular and the granular layers where Purkinje cells have arranged in a monolayer. Evidence for translocation of climbing fibers from their perisomatic to their peridendritic position is already distinct in these young <BrainRegion>cerebella</BrainRegion>. Combination of anterograde and retrograde fiber system tracing experiments discloses the following crossed topography of olivocerebellar projections: The <BrainRegion>caudal half of the medial accessory olive</BrainRegion> projects mainly to the <BrainRegion>vermis of the posterior lobe</BrainRegion>, whereas its <BrainRegion>rostral half</BrainRegion> projects to the <BrainRegion>flocculus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>paraflocculus</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>intermediate cortex</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>principal olive</BrainRegion>, ventral and dorsal lamellae, supplies climbing fiber inputs to the <BrainRegion>hemispheric cortex</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>caudal half of the dorsal accessory olive</BrainRegion> projects to the <BrainRegion>lateral portion of the vermis of the anterior lobe</BrainRegion>, whereas neurons in its <BrainRegion>rostral half</BrainRegion> send their axons toward the <BrainRegion>intermediate cortex</BrainRegion>. This topographic arrangement is, therefore, similar to that reported for adult mammals. The present results, alone or when compared with those obtained during other studies on the synaptogenesis between climbing fibers and Purkinje cells, allow the following conclusions: The climbing fibers enter the <BrainRegion>cerebellar cortex</BrainRegion> before Purkinje cells have reached the developmental phase compatible with synaptogenesis. They wait in the <BrainRegion>medullary white matter</BrainRegion> until appropriate maturation of their cellular targets. Olivocerebellar topography is roughly similar in newborn, 5-day -old, and adult rats. Synaptogenesis between climbing fibers and Purkinje cells, which is known not to start before the second postnatal day, is not necessary for the establishment of the topographic organization of the olivocerebellar projection.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Postnatal changes of vesicular glutamate transporter (VGluT)1 and VGluT2 immunoreactivities and their colocalization in the mouse <BrainRegion>forebrain</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGluT1) and VGluT2 accumulate neurotransmitter glutamate into synaptic vesicles at presynaptic terminals, and their antibodies are thus considered to be a good marker for glutamatergic axon terminals. In the present study, we investigated the postnatal development and maturation of glutamatergic neuronal systems by single- and double-immunolabelings for Vesicular glutamate transporter 1(VGluT1) and VGluT2 in mouse <BrainRegion>forebrain</BrainRegion> including the <BrainRegion>telencephalon</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>diencephalon</BrainRegion>. VGluT2 immunoreactivity was widely distributed in the <BrainRegion>forebrain</BrainRegion>, particularly in the <BrainRegion>diencephalon</BrainRegion>, from postnatal day 0 (P0) to adulthood, suggesting relatively early maturation of VGluT2-loaded glutamatergic axons. In contrast, Vesicular glutamate transporter 1(VGluT1) immunoreactivity was intense only in the <BrainRegion>limbic regions</BrainRegion> at postnatal day 0(P0) , and drastically increased in the other <BrainRegion>telencephalic</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>diencephalic regions</BrainRegion> during three postnatal weeks. Interestingly, Vesicular glutamate transporter 1(VGluT1) immunoreactivity was frequently colocalized with VGluT2 immunoreactivity at single axon terminal-like profiles in layer IV of the <BrainRegion>primary somatosensory area</BrainRegion> from P5 to P10 and in the <BrainRegion>ventral posteromedial thalamic nucleus</BrainRegion> from postnatal day 0(P0) to P14. This was in sharp contrast to the finding that almost no colocalization was found in glomeruli of the <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>, patchy regions of the <BrainRegion>caudate-putamen</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>ventral posterolateral thalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>, where moderate to intense immunoreactivities for Vesicular glutamate transporter 1(VGluT1) and VGluT2 were intermingled with each other in neuropil during postnatal development. The present results indicate that VGluT2-loaded glutamatergic axons maturate earlier than Vesicular glutamate transporter 1(VGluT1) -laden axons in the mouse <BrainRegion>telencephalic</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>diencephalic regions</BrainRegion>, and suggest that Vesicular glutamate transporter 1(VGluT1) plays a transient developmental role in some glutamatergic systems that mainly use VGluT2 in the adulthood.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Immunologic differentiation of two high-affinity neurotensin receptor isoforms in the developing rat brain.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Earlier studies have demonstrated overexpression of NT1 neurotensin receptors in rat brain during the first 2 weeks of life. To gain insight into this phenomenon, we investigated the identity and distribution of NT1 receptor proteins in the brain of 10-day-old rats by using two different NT1 antibodies: one (Abi3) directed against the third intracellular loop and the other (Abi4) against the C-terminus of the receptor. Immunoblot experiments that used Abi3 revealed the presence of two differentially glycosylated forms of the NT1 receptor in developing rat brain: one migrating at 54 and the other at 52 kDa. Whereas the 54-kDa form was expressed from birth to adulthood, the 52-kDa form was detected only at 10 and 15 days postnatal. Only the 52-kDa isoform was recognized by Abi4. By immunohistochemistry, both forms of the receptor were found to be predominantly expressed in <BrainRegion>cerebral cortex</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>dorsal hippocampus</BrainRegion>, in keeping with earlier radioligand binding and in situ hybridization data. However, whereas Abi4 immunoreactivity was mainly concentrated within nerve cell bodies and extensively colocalized with the Golgi marker alpha-mannosidase II, Abi3 immunoreactivity was predominantly located along neuronal processes. These results suggest that the transitorily expressed 52-kDa protein corresponds to an immature, incompletely glycosylated and largely intracellular form of the NT1 receptor and that the 54-kDa protein corresponds to a mature, fully glycosylated, and largely membrane-associated form. They also indicate that antibodies directed against different sequences of G-protein-coupled receptors may yield isoform-specific immunohistochemical labeling patterns in mammalian brain. Finally, the selective expression of the short form of the NT1 receptor early in development suggests that it may play a specific role in the establishment of neuronal circuitry.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Chemical and morphological studies on garfish peripheral nerves.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Gangliosides were extracted, separated by thin layer chromatography, and quantitated in three <BrainRegion>cranial nerves</BrainRegion> of the garfish (Lepisosteus osseus): the completely unmyelinated <BrainRegion>olfactory nerve</BrainRegion> (OLF), and two nerves composed of both myelinated and unmyelinated fibers, viz., the main trunk of the <BrainRegion>maxillary nerve</BrainRegion> (MAX) and a branch of the <BrainRegion>maxillary nerve</BrainRegion> (BR- maxillary nerve(MAX) ). Morphological studies on each of these nerves were done to verify that the <BrainRegion>olfactory nerve</BrainRegion>(OLF) had been excised free of any contamination from the accompanying myelinated BR- <BrainRegion>maxillary nerve</BrainRegion>(MAX) , to aid in the interpretation of the biochemical findings, and to clarify the nature of the <BrainRegion>olfactory nerve</BrainRegion>(OLF) supporting cell. The chief chemical findings were (1) documentation of the presence of gangliosides in nerves previously thought not to contain them, (2) demonstration that gangliosides can be associated with unmyelinated nerves, (3) demonstration of a greater proportion of one simple ganglioside (G-6) in the <BrainRegion>olfactory nerve</BrainRegion>(OLF) but greater proportions of two complex gangliosides (G-2 and G-0) in the <BrainRegion>maxillary nerve</BrainRegion>(MAX) and BR- <BrainRegion>maxillary nerve</BrainRegion>(MAX) , and (4) that either GM4 or a variant of the GM3 is present in <BrainRegion>olfactory nerve</BrainRegion>(OLF) . The morphological findings with respect to the difficulty of ascribing only peripheral nervous system characteristics to the <BrainRegion>olfactory nerve</BrainRegion>(OLF) supporting cell are discussed in relation to the ganglioside band chromatographing slightly ahead of GM4 in the <BrainRegion>olfactory nerve</BrainRegion>(OLF) .</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Pattern of development of ascending and descending fibers in embryonic <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> of chick: I. Role of position information.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Previous studies on the rigid time and position pattern of embryonic <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> development are extended to include the pattern of growth of axonal processes. This study was designed to analyze the position of axons in the marginal zone as they course (fasciculate) in the ascending and descending direction from a single <BrainRegion>spinal segment</BrainRegion>. Injections of 3H-proline were made into L1 or T6 of chick embryos of stages 21--29 (3.5--6 days of incubation). The location of radioactive label in the marginal zone was analyzed autoradiographically to show the location of labeled axons originating from the injected segment. In the early stages of development (stage 21), the labeled descending axons were located in the most <BrainRegion>ventromedial aspect of the marginal zone</BrainRegion>. The labeled ascending axons were located more laterally and to the perimeter of this zone. In stages 27--29, the labeled axons near the site of injection were located in the inner two-thirds of the marginal zone, and in the progressively more rostral levels the label shifted laterally and to the perimeter in a laminar pattern. It was concluded that the labeled ascending axons from an individual spinal segment layer upon the axons which originate from the more rostral segments. How this rigid time and position pattern of axonal growth can impart a topographic order into fiber tracts of the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> was discussed.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Changes in the organization of the <BrainRegion>ventroposterior lateral thalamic nucleus</BrainRegion> after digit removal in adult raccoon.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The <BrainRegion>ventroposterior lateral nucleus of the thalamus</BrainRegion> was studied in seven raccoons that had undergone amputation of the fourth digit between 2 and 5 months previously. Extracellular recordings were made in a series of closely spaced penetrations through the <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion> in chloralose anesthetized animals. The responses to cutaneous stimulation of the forepaw were used to reconstruct the somatotopic organization of the <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion> and to identify recording sites believed to be located in the digit zone that had lost its peripheral input. Twelve penetrations that passed through both of the adjacent fifth and third digit regions were analyzed in detail to delineate this deafferented region. None of the recording sites in this region were completely silent, indicating that the deafferented <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion> had undergone significant reorganization of its inputs. At most sites, the neurons had receptive fields on the skin surrounding the amputation wound and including one of the adjacent digits. Approximately half of the sites had low thresholds in the range of normal <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> neurons. These results indicate that the <BrainRegion>ventroposterior thalamus</BrainRegion> is capable of substantial reorganization, which may account for much of the reorganization seen in <BrainRegion>somatosensory cortex</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Dendritic domains of nociceptive-responsive parabrachial neurons match terminal fields of lamina I neurons in the rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>This study investigates, in the anesthetized rat, the dendritic extent of <BrainRegion>parabrachial</BrainRegion> (PB) neurons whose nociceptive response to noxious stimuli has been previously recorded with an extracellular micropipette. The <BrainRegion>parabrachial</BrainRegion>(PB) neurons were then injected with biocytin through the recording micropipette, via a juxtacellular technique. The dendritic arborization of individual <BrainRegion>parabrachial</BrainRegion>(PB) neurons was carefully compared with the projections of <BrainRegion>medullary</BrainRegion> (trigeminal) and <BrainRegion>spinal</BrainRegion> lamina I neurons. The latter projections were labeled in separate animals that received injections of Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin restricted to the superficial layers of <BrainRegion>spinal or medullary dorsal horn</BrainRegion>. We report here that: 1) <BrainRegion>parabrachial</BrainRegion>(PB) neurons excited chiefly by noxious stimulation of the face have their dendritic tree located primarily within the field of lamina I <BrainRegion>trigeminal</BrainRegion> projections, i.e., in the <BrainRegion>caudal portion of parabrachial(PB) area</BrainRegion>, around the <BrainRegion>external medial and the caudal part of the external lateral subnuclei</BrainRegion>; and 2) <BrainRegion>parabrachial</BrainRegion>(PB) neurons excited chiefly by noxious stimulation of the paw or the tail have their dendritic tree located primarily within the field of lamina I <BrainRegion>spinal</BrainRegion> projections, i.e., in <BrainRegion>parabrachial</BrainRegion>(PB) mid-extent, around the borderline between the external lateral and both the lateral crescent and the <BrainRegion>superior lateral subnuclei</BrainRegion>. Our results suggest the presence of an extensive excitatory axodendritic link between lamina I projections and <BrainRegion>parabrachial</BrainRegion>(PB) nociceptive neurons around the lateral crescent and the <BrainRegion>external medial subnuclei</BrainRegion>. These findings strengthen the possibility of involvement of a subgroup of <BrainRegion>parabrachial</BrainRegion>(PB) neurons in nociceptive processes.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Quantitative analyses of intracellularly characterized and labeled thalamocortical projection neurons in the <BrainRegion>ventrobasal complex</BrainRegion> of primates.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>This study describes the architecture of neurons and individual dendritic arbors of thirteen intracellularly labeled thalamocortical projection neurons that respond to non-noxious stimuli from the primate (Macaca fascicularis or Macaca mulatta) <BrainRegion>ventrobasal complex</BrainRegion> (VB). The neurons compose a homogeneous morphological class with total dendritic lengths from 10,169 microns to 21,711 microns (mean 17,615 microns +/- 3,705). The labeled neurons were remarkably similar in most measured parameters including the number of dendrites (7.5 +/- 1.2), percentage of dichotomous branching (89.8% +/- 3.4), and contribution of terminal branches to total dendritic length (88.4% +/- 2.0). The individual dendrites ranged in total length from 443 microns to 7,657 microns with a mean of 2,346 microns (+/- 137, n = 98). There was a positive correlation between stem dendrite diameter and total dendrite length, making it possible to estimate the total size of an individual dendrite by measuring the stem dendrite diameter. There was only a small increase in mean path distance with increasing dendritic size at the whole neuron and individual dendritic levels, so that for individual dendrites the mean path distance of a dendrite consisting of only two segments was 199 microns, while the mean path distance for a dendrite with eight segments was only 45 microns longer. Analysis of dendrite diameter, segment order, and path distance shows that dendritic diameter is not reliable for determining the location of synaptic contacts viewed by electron microscopy onto dendritic trees. The small variation of measured parameters between these neurons presents a powerful tool for future developmental, plasticity and comparative studies of <BrainRegion>ventrobasal complex</BrainRegion>(VB) neurons.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Altered expression of pp60c-src induced by peripheral nerve injury.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The normal src protein (pp60c-src) is localized principally in the nerve growth cone of developing neurons and declines to low levels with synaptic maturation. To determine whether pp60c-src is reexpressed in regenerating axons, its expression was studied by immunoblotting and immunocytochemical analyses in adult chicken sciatic nerve following nerve crush injury. pp60c-src expression was found to increase during nerve repair with a temporal and spatial pattern consistent with a localization in regenerating axons. At the crush site, pp60c-src increased to maximal levels 7 days postinjury, increasing fivefold relative to 0 day nerve. In the nerve segment distal to the injury, the maximal increase in pp60c-src was sevenfold and occurred between 11 and 21 days postinjury. Immunoperoxidase staining revealed pp60c-src in regenerating axons and certain nonneuronal cells at the site of nerve repair. pp60c-src was induced in both motor and sensory neurons, as shown by increased pp60c-src immunoreactivity in their cell bodies located in the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> and dorsal root ganglion. Phosphotyrosine-modified proteins that were potential targets of pp60c-src increased following nerve crush, and were localized to outgrowing neurites as well as to nonneuronal cells. These results suggest that pp60c-src is a common component of cellular mechanisms regulating growth cone migration in both regenerating and developing axons.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Distribution of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and TrkB receptor proteins in the fetal and postnatal <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>cerebellum</BrainRegion> of the guinea pig.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>This study investigates the distribution of brain-derived neurotrophic factor protein (BDNF) and its receptor, TrkB, during the development of <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>cerebellum</BrainRegion> in a long-gestation species, the guinea pig. In the granule cell populations of both structures, brain-derived neurotrophic factor protein(BDNF) immunoreactivity (-IR) was exclusive to postmigratory, mature neurons. In <BrainRegion>dentate</BrainRegion> granule cells, TrkB-IR was coexpressed with brain-derived neurotrophic factor protein(BDNF) -IR, suggesting that the ligand-receptor interaction could occur by means of an autocrine/paracrine mechanism. In <BrainRegion>cerebellar</BrainRegion> granule cells, TrkB-IR was detected in both pre- and postmigratory cells, indicating that immature neurons are also brain-derived neurotrophic factor protein(BDNF) -responsive. With advancing gestational age an increase in the intensity of brain-derived neurotrophic factor protein(BDNF) -IR in granule cells was accompanied by concomitant increases in the staining and areal growth of the associated mossy fiber layer in the <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion>, and the molecular layer in the <BrainRegion>cerebellum</BrainRegion>. The developmental increase in brain-derived neurotrophic factor protein(BDNF) - and TrkB-IR in the neuropil of both structures coincided with periods of significant growth in all strata, indicating a role for brain-derived neurotrophic factor protein(BDNF) and TrkB in process outgrowth. In the <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>CA2</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>CA3</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>hilar</BrainRegion>, neurons demonstrated both brain-derived neurotrophic factor protein(BDNF) - and TrkB-IR during development and maturation, whereas <BrainRegion>CA1</BrainRegion> neurons showed TrkB-IR throughout this period but only transient brain-derived neurotrophic factor protein(BDNF) -IR in early gestation. In the fetal <BrainRegion>cerebellum</BrainRegion>, Purkinje cell bodies coexpressed brain-derived neurotrophic factor protein(BDNF) -IR and TrkB-IR. In the postnatal period, brain-derived neurotrophic factor protein(BDNF) -IR was down-regulated but TrkB-IR persisted, indicating that mature Purkinje cells might retain their responsiveness to brain-derived neurotrophic factor protein(BDNF) . Thus, we have demonstrated in both the <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>cerebellum</BrainRegion> that the spatiotemporal distribution of brain-derived neurotrophic factor protein(BDNF) -IR and TrkB-IR coincides with the maturation of granule cells prenatally and with significant periods of neuropil growth, both prenatally and in the immediate postnatal period.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Telencephalic</BrainRegion> connections in lizards. I. Projections to <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The afferent connections to five <BrainRegion>cortical regions</BrainRegion> in two distantly related species of lizards (Gekko gecko and Iguana iguana) were studied by means of retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase conjugated to wheat germ agglutinin. Each of the five <BrainRegion>cortical regions</BrainRegion> is characterized by a specific pattern of projections from <BrainRegion>telencephalic</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>hypothalamic</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>brainstem regions</BrainRegion>. Subdivisions within the five <BrainRegion>cortical regions</BrainRegion> also receive different patterns of projections. The thalamo-cortical projections are as follows: The <BrainRegion>small-celled mediodorsal cortex</BrainRegion> receives a projection from <BrainRegion>nucleus dorsolateralis anterior pars magnocellularis</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>large-celled mediodorsal cortex</BrainRegion> receives projections from <BrainRegion>nucleus dorsolateralis anterior pars parvicellularis and pars magnocellularis</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>dorsal cortex</BrainRegion> receives a projection from <BrainRegion>nucleus dorsolateralis anterior pars parvicellularis</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>lateral cortex</BrainRegion> receives a projection from <BrainRegion>nucleus dorsolateralis anterior pars magnocellularis</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>pallial thickening</BrainRegion> receives projections from <BrainRegion>nucleus dorsomedialis</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>nucleus intercalatus</BrainRegion>. The latter nucleus receives a direct <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> projection. Thus, the <BrainRegion>pallial thickening</BrainRegion> is the recipient of a retino-thalamocortical projection. To date, comparisons of data from experimental studies have suggested that the <BrainRegion>cortical regions</BrainRegion> in lizards and turtles may be organized differently. However, the results of the present study suggest that the organization of <BrainRegion>cortical regions</BrainRegion> among reptiles is more similar than previously realized.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>The course of axons of <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> ganglion cells within the <BrainRegion>optic nerv</BrainRegion>e and tract of the chick (Gallus gallus).</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Small laser lesions placed in the posthatch chicken <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> resulted in axotomy and then death of all ganglion cells located in a sector peripheral to the primary damage. With the use of silver techniques, the patterns of degenerating <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> fibers in the <BrainRegion>optic nerve</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>chiasm</BrainRegion>, and optic tract were examined. In the proximal part of the <BrainRegion>optic nerve</BrainRegion>, radial <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> lesions resulted in a sheet of degenerating axons along the rostrocaudal extent of the nerve. The position of degenerating axons was related to the site of their entry in the <BrainRegion>optic nerve</BrainRegion> head with an overlapping distribution of degenerating fibers entering the <BrainRegion>optic nerve</BrainRegion> head from equivalent points from the temporal and nasal sides. In the <BrainRegion>optic chiasm</BrainRegion>, the distribution of fibers was similar to that seen in the proximal part of the <BrainRegion>optic nerve</BrainRegion>. In the optic tract there was a similar mixing of fibers from opposite sides of the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>. The ventral, nasal and temporal <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> fibers lay in the superficial part of the tract whereas the fibers from the <BrainRegion>nasal and temporal dorsal retina</BrainRegion> ran in the deeper, medial aspect of the tract. The central-to-peripheral axes of the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> were mapped along the rostrocaudal axis of the tract. As the tract approached the <BrainRegion>tectum</BrainRegion> degenerating fibers from single <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> lesions did not always remain together. In the case of a lesion in the <BrainRegion>ventral nasal retina</BrainRegion>, degenerating fibers split into two bundles located at opposite ends of the tract only to reunite at their terminal regional at the caudal pole of the <BrainRegion>tectum</BrainRegion>.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Descending projections from the <BrainRegion>gigantocellular tegmental field</BrainRegion> in the cat: cells of origin and their <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> trajectories.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The trajectories and the cells of origin of the <BrainRegion>pontobulbar gigantocellular tegmental field</BrainRegion> descending pathways were studied in the cat using anterograde WGA-HRP and retrograde HRP techniques. Four main descending pathways and cells of origin were delineated: (1) Predominantly large neurons in the <BrainRegion>pontine gigantocellular tegmental field</BrainRegion> (average soma diameter = 43.4 microns) and <BrainRegion>rostral bulbar gigantocellular tegmental field</BrainRegion> (41.3 microns) gave rise to <BrainRegion>reticulospinal</BrainRegion> fibers descending in the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral medial longitudinal fasciculus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>ventral funiculus</BrainRegion> and distributed in laminae V-X with an ipsilateral predominance. These were primarily large-diameter fibers. (2) Predominantly large neurons (46.9 microns) in the <BrainRegion>bulbar gigantocellular tegmental field</BrainRegion> gave rise to <BrainRegion>reticulospinal</BrainRegion> fibers descending in the contralateral medial longitudinal fasciculus and <BrainRegion>ventral funiculus</BrainRegion>. These were mainly large-diameter fibers. (3) Neurons of predominantly medium size (29.5 microns) in the <BrainRegion>pontine gigantocellular tegmental field</BrainRegion> gave rise to reticuloreticular fibers descending directly to and distributed bilaterally in the <BrainRegion>bulbar reticular formation</BrainRegion>. These were small-diameter fibers. (4) Neurons of predominantly medium size (28.9 microns) in the <BrainRegion>bulbar gigantocellular tegmental field</BrainRegion> gave rise to <BrainRegion>reticulospinal</BrainRegion> fibers descending in the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral reticular formation</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>lateral funiculus</BrainRegion>. These were small-diameter fibers.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>The <BrainRegion>second visual area</BrainRegion> in the marmoset monkey: visuotopic organisation, magnification factors, architectonical boundaries, and modularity.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The organisation of the <BrainRegion>second visual area</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>V2</BrainRegion>) in marmoset monkeys was studied by means of extracellular recordings of responses to visual stimulation and examination of myelin- and cytochrome oxidase-stained sections. <BrainRegion>Area V2</BrainRegion> forms a continuous <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> belt of variable width (1-2 mm adjacent to the foveal representation of <BrainRegion>V1</BrainRegion>, and 3-3.5 mm near the midline and on the tentorial surface) bordering <BrainRegion>V1</BrainRegion> on the <BrainRegion>lateral, dorsal, medial, and tentorial surfaces of the occipital lobe</BrainRegion>. The total surface area of <BrainRegion>V2</BrainRegion> is approximately 100 mm2, or about 50% of the surface area of <BrainRegion>V1</BrainRegion> in the same individuals. In each hemisphere, the receptive fields of <BrainRegion>V2</BrainRegion> neurones cover the entire contralateral visual hemifield, forming an ordered visuotopic representation. As in other simians, the <BrainRegion>dorsal and ventral halves of V2</BrainRegion> represent the lower and upper contralateral quadrants, respectively, with little invasion of the ipsilateral hemifield. The representation of the vertical meridian forms the caudal border of <BrainRegion>V2</BrainRegion>, with <BrainRegion>V1</BrainRegion>, whereas a field discontinuity <BrainRegion>approximately</BrainRegion> coincident with the horizontal meridian forms the rostral border of <BrainRegion>V2</BrainRegion>, with other visually responsive areas. The bridge of <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion> connecting <BrainRegion>dorsal and ventral V2</BrainRegion> contains neurones with receptive fields centred within 1 degree of the centre of the <BrainRegion>fovea</BrainRegion>. The visuotopy, size, shape and location of <BrainRegion>V2</BrainRegion> show little variation among individuals. Analysis of cortical magnification factor (CMF) revealed that the <BrainRegion>V2</BrainRegion> map of the visual field is highly anisotropic: for any given eccentricity, the cortical magnification factor(CMF) is approximately twice as large in the dimension parallel to the <BrainRegion>V1</BrainRegion>/<BrainRegion>V2</BrainRegion> border as it is perpendicular to this border. Moreover, comparison of <BrainRegion>V2</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>V1</BrainRegion> in the same individuals demonstrated that the representation of the central visual field is emphasised in <BrainRegion>V2</BrainRegion>, relative to <BrainRegion>V1</BrainRegion>. Approximately half of the surface area of <BrainRegion>V2</BrainRegion> is dedicated to the representation of the central 5 degrees of the visual field. Calculations based on the <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> magnification factor(CMF) , receptive field scatter, and receptive field size revealed that the point-image size measured parallel to the <BrainRegion>V1</BrainRegion>/<BrainRegion>V2</BrainRegion> border (2-3 mm) equals the width of a full cycle of cytochrome oxidase stripes in <BrainRegion>V2</BrainRegion>, suggesting a close correspondence between physiological and anatomical estimates of the dimensions of modular components in this area.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Rod bipolar cells in the mammalian <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> show protein kinase C-like immunoreactivity.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>An antibody directed against protein kinase C (PKC) was applied to various mammalian <BrainRegion>retinae</BrainRegion>. In the cat, rat, rabbit, and macaque monkey we found protein kinase C(PKC) -like immunoreactivity in bipolar cells which had the morphology of rod bipolar cells; in the rat some amacrine cells were also immunoreactive. In the outer plexiform layer, labeled dendrites were always the central elements of the rod spherule invagination, and in the inner plexiform layer only rod bipolar axons and their axon terminals were immunoreactive. The antibody against protein kinase C(PKC) thus can be used to distinguish rod bipolar cells from cone bipolar cells. The antibody against protein kinase C(PKC) was used to determine the densities of rods and rod bipolar cells in the cat retina. In the <BrainRegion>central retina</BrainRegion> we found a rod to rod bipolar ratio of 16 to 1, in the periphery the ratio increases to 25 to 1. In freshly dissociated <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>, cells with rod bipolar morphology could be identified; these cells were also labeled with the anti- protein kinase C(PKC) antibody. Hence, protein kinase C(PKC) -like immunoreactivity can be used to recognize rod bipolar cells in vitro.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Brain weight throughout the life span of the chimpanzee.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Studies on human postmortem material report lower brain weights in older than in younger cohorts, whereas there is no apparent change with age in the rhesus monkey. In view of these contrasting results, we examined the pattern of brain weight across the life span in the chimpanzee, one of the closest biological relatives of humans. To place the study in context of the empirical life expectancy of the chimpanzee, we first performed a survival analysis on data from 275 chimpanzees that were maintained in the colony of the Yerkes Primate Center. The survival analysis revealed the maximum life spans of female and male chimpanzees to be about 59 and 45 years, respectively. We examined fresh brain weights from 76 chimpanzees ranging in age from birth to 59.4 years of age. The brains were taken from 9 infants (birth to 1 year of age), 25 juveniles (1-7 years), 13 adolescents (7-15 years), 21 young adults (15-30 years), and 8 old adults (over 30 years). Adult brain weight was achieved by the age of 7 years. The adolescent and young adult chimpanzees had the largest brain weights; in these two age groups combined, the mean brain weight (+/- standard deviation) was 368.1 g (+/-37.3) for females (n = 17) and 405.6 g (+/-39.4) for males (n = 17). This sex difference was statistically significant (P &amp;lt; 0.01). Simple linear regression performed on the combined material from females and males aged 7 years and older revealed a decline in brain weight with advancing age of 1.1 g/year (P &lt; 0.05). When the effect of sex on brain weight was statistically controlled for, the loss of brain weight with age was 0.9 g/year (P = 0.07). These results suggest that brain weight declines moderately with age in the chimpanzee as it does in humans.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Sexually dimorphic expression of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) immunoreactivity by rat <BrainRegion>mediobasal hypothalamic</BrainRegion> neurons.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Although the <BrainRegion>hypothalamic arcuate nucleus</BrainRegion> is a sexually dimorphic region of the rat brain, there are no reports of sex differences in the number of neurons containing specific neuropeptides within this structure. As cells synthesizing calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) have been shown to exhibit sex differences in other steroid-receptive regions of the rat brain, we examined whether the calcitonin gene-related peptide(CGRP) -immunoreactive cells located in the <BrainRegion>mediobasal hypothalamus</BrainRegion> may also be sexually dimorphic. Immunostaining of sections from male and female colchicine-treated rats revealed a small population of calcitonin gene-related peptide(CGRP) -immunoreactive cells distributed throughout the <BrainRegion>arcuate nucleus</BrainRegion>. Immunoreactive cells were also detected in the <BrainRegion>lateral hypothalamic perifornical region</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>dorsomedial, posterior periventricular and ventral tuberomammillary nuclei</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>zona incerta</BrainRegion>. Cell count analysis revealed approximately twice as many calcitonin gene-related peptide(CGRP) -immunoreactive cell profiles in the rostral (P &amp;lt; 0.01), middle (P &lt; 0.001), and caudal (P &lt; 0.01) thirds of the <BrainRegion>arcuate nucleus</BrainRegion> of male rats compared with females. A significant sex difference in immunoreactive cell numbers (male &amp;gt; female) was also detected within the <BrainRegion>caudal dorsomedial nucleus</BrainRegion> (P &amp;lt; 0.05) but not in the <BrainRegion>posterior periventricular nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>perifornical region</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>zona incerta</BrainRegion>. Although fibers immunoreactive for calcitonin gene-related peptide(CGRP) were identified in low density throughout the <BrainRegion>mediobasal hypothalamus</BrainRegion>, only female rats displayed prominent fiber staining in the <BrainRegion>periventricular region</BrainRegion>. Double-labelling immunofluorescence experiments revealed that the calcitonin gene-related peptide(CGRP) -immunoreactive cells within the <BrainRegion>zona incerta</BrainRegion>, but not the <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion>, were also immunoreactive for tyrosine hydroxylase; at least 60% of the A13 dopaminergic neurons co-express calcitonin gene-related peptide(CGRP) . These results provide evidence that sex differences exist in the number of specific neuropeptide-synthesizing cells within the <BrainRegion>hypothalamic arcuate nucleus</BrainRegion> and provide further examples of cell populations expressing calcitonin gene-related peptide(CGRP) immunoreactivity in a sexually dimorphic manner.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Descending projections from the <BrainRegion>auditory cortex</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>inferior colliculus</BrainRegion> in the gerbil, Meriones unguiculatus.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Corticofugal projections to the <BrainRegion>auditory midbrain</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>inferior colliculus</BrainRegion> (IC), influence the way in which specific sets of <BrainRegion>inferior colliculus</BrainRegion>(IC) neurons process acoustic signals. We used retrograde tracer (Fluorogold, Fluororuby, microbeads) injections in the <BrainRegion>inferior colliculus</BrainRegion>(IC) to study the morphology and location of cortico-collicular projecting neurons and anterograde tracer (dextran biotin) injections in <BrainRegion>auditory cortical fields</BrainRegion> to describe the distribution of terminals in the <BrainRegion>inferior colliculus</BrainRegion>(IC) . Nissl staining, cytochrome oxidase activity, and neurofilament SMI32 immunostaining were used to delimit the different <BrainRegion>auditory areas</BrainRegion>. We defined a <BrainRegion>primary or &quot;core" auditory cortex</BrainRegion> and a <BrainRegion>secondary &quot;caudal" auditory area</BrainRegion> containing layer V pyramidal neurons that project to the <BrainRegion>inferior colliculus</BrainRegion>(IC) . These projections target the <BrainRegion>central nucleus of the inferior colliculus</BrainRegion>(IC) (CN inferior colliculus(IC) ) ipsilaterally and the <BrainRegion>inferior colliculus(IC) cortices</BrainRegion> bilaterally, with the ipsilateral component predominant. Other <BrainRegion>secondary auditory areas</BrainRegion>, dorsal and ventral to the core, do not directly participate in this projection. The <BrainRegion>ventral secondary cortex</BrainRegion> targets midbrain <BrainRegion>periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion>. The projection from the <BrainRegion>core cortex</BrainRegion> originates from two classes of layer V pyramidal cells. Cells presenting a tufted apical dendrite in layer I have dense terminal fields in the <BrainRegion>inferior colliculus(IC) cortices</BrainRegion>. Pyramids lacking layer I dendritic tufts target the <BrainRegion>CN inferior colliculus</BrainRegion>(IC) in a less dense but tonotopic manner. The <BrainRegion>caudal cortex</BrainRegion> projection originates from smaller layer V pyramids and targets the <BrainRegion>inferior colliculus</BrainRegion>(IC) cortices with dense terminal fields. Descending auditory inputs from the core and caudal areas converge in the <BrainRegion>dorsal and external cortices of the inferior colliculus</BrainRegion>(IC) . Descending connections to the gerbil <BrainRegion>inferior colliculus</BrainRegion>(IC) form a segregated system in which multiple descending channels originating from different neuronal subpopulations may modulate specific aspects of ascending auditory information.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Influence of chronic prenatal ethanol on cholinergic neurons of the septohippocampal system.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>This study characterized the influence of full-term gestational ethanol exposure on choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)-immunoreactive neurons that project to the <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion>, within the <BrainRegion>medial septal (MS) nucleus</BrainRegion> and the vertical limb of the <BrainRegion>diagonal band of Broca</BrainRegion> (DBv). On gestation days 1-22, pregnant dams were fed either a vitamin fortified ethanol-containing liquid diet, pair fed a calorically equivalent sucrose-containing diet, or given rat chow ad libitum. In a previous study, we found that chronic prenatal exposure to ethanol, in this manner, resulted in a significant decline in the ontogenetic upregulation of choline acetyltransferase(ChAT) activity in the <BrainRegion>septal area</BrainRegion> during the second postnatal week, but was followed by recovery to control levels by adulthood. On postnatal days 14 and 60 (P14 and P60) the brains were prepared for choline acetyltransferase(ChAT) immunocytochemistry. Ethanol exposure had little influence on the number of choline acetyltransferase(ChAT) -positive neurons in the <BrainRegion>medial septal(MS) nucleus</BrainRegion> of animals at either age. Ethanol exposure had no effect on neuronal size or choline acetyltransferase(ChAT) staining intensity of <BrainRegion>medial septal</BrainRegion>(MS) or <BrainRegion>DBv</BrainRegion> neurons when compared to chow-fed offspring. Although age-related increases in cholinergic neuronal numbers and decreases in neuronal size were observed between juvenile and adult animals, prenatal ethanol exposure did not appear to influence these postnatal changes in the population as a whole. Overall, these findings suggest that the anatomical maturation of septal cholinergic neurons may be relatively insensitive to prenatal ethanol exposure under conditions of a vitamin-rich dietary supplementation, while biochemical development within this region may be more susceptible to early ethanol influences.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Functionally distinct subdivisions of the <BrainRegion>macroglomerular complex</BrainRegion> in the <BrainRegion>antennal lobe</BrainRegion> of the male sphinx moth Manduca sexta.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Each <BrainRegion>antennal lobe</BrainRegion> in the brain of a male moth has a distinctive neuropil structure, the <BrainRegion>macroglomerular complex</BrainRegion> (MGC), which is specialized for primary processing of information about the conspecific female sex-pheromone blend. Olfactory interneurons with dendritic arborizations in the <BrainRegion>macroglomerular complex</BrainRegion>(MGC) were examined by means of tandem intracellular recording and staining with Lucifer Yellow. Neurons that responded selectively to stimulation of the antenna with the major pheromone component, (E,Z)-10,12-hexadecadienal, had arborizations that were restricted to a toroidal subdivision (the &quot;toroid") of the <BrainRegion>macroglomerular complex</BrainRegion>(MGC) . Similarly, neurons that responded selectively to antennal stimulation with (E,Z)-11,13-pentadecadienal, a more stable mimic of a second essential but chemically unstable pheromone component, (E,E,Z)-10,12,14-hexadecatrienal, had arborizations confined to a <BrainRegion>globular subdivision</BrainRegion> (the &quot;cumulus") of the <BrainRegion>macroglomerular complex</BrainRegion>(MGC) situated more proximally to the <BrainRegion>antennal nerve</BrainRegion> input. One neuron that responded to both of these stimuli clearly had arborizations in both <BrainRegion>subdivisions of the macroglomerular complex</BrainRegion>(MGC) . These anatomically distinct <BrainRegion>subdivisions of the macroglomerular complex</BrainRegion>(MGC) thus appear also to be functionally separate regions of pheromone-processing neuropil.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Starburst cholinergic amacrine cells in the tree shrew <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>In all mammalian retinae studied to date, starburst cholinergic amacrine cells are a consistently occurring cell type. Here, we show that the cone-dominated <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> of the tree shrew also has starburst cells with the characteristic radially symmetric branching pattern known from other species. Dendritic field sizes increase from 150 microm in the <BrainRegion>central retina</BrainRegion> to 300 microm in the <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> periphery. The characteristic morphology is established early during postnatal development. Labelling the starburst cholinergic cells with an antibody against choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) reveals two dendritic strata in the inner plexiform layer and two corresponding soma populations in the inner nuclear layer (orthotopic) and ganglion cell layer (displaced). These features are present in the adult and in early postnatal stages. In the adult, the density of the orthotopic population as well as the displaced population peaks in the <BrainRegion>central retina</BrainRegion> at about 2,200 cells/mm2 and has a peripheral minimum of 400 cells/mm2. These properties are qualitatively similar to those of starburst cells in rod-dominated <BrainRegion>retinae</BrainRegion>. In contrast to findings in other mammals, we did not see gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) or glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 kDa (GAD65) immunoreactivity in tree shrew starburst cells. These cells also appear to lack synaptophysin, a ubiquitous synaptic vesicle protein detected in the starburst cells of some other mammals. However, synaptoporin, a homologous synaptic vesicle protein, appears to be present in tree shrew starburst cells.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Origin of the rubrospinal tract in neonatal, developing, and mature rats.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>This investigation describes the origin of the rubrospinal tract in neonatal (1-10 days old), developing (15-20 days old), and mature (2-4 months old) rats studied by using the horseradish peroxidase (HRP) method of tracing neuronal connections. horseradish peroxidase(HRP) was administered in the <BrainRegion>cervical or lumbosacral segments of the spinal cord</BrainRegion> either in the crystal or solution form. The results showed that the rubrospinal tract extended to the <BrainRegion>lumbosacral part of the spinal cord</BrainRegion> at birth. There appeared to be no difference in the pattern of labelled rubrospinal (RS) neurons following the administration of horseradish peroxidase(HRP) in the <BrainRegion>cervical or the lumbosacral cord segment</BrainRegion> of the neonatal, developing, and mature rats. In rats of these three age groups, labelled neurons were found bilaterally in the <BrainRegion>red nucleus</BrainRegion>, with a contralateral predominance, and they were found in both the <BrainRegion>parvicellular and magnocellular portions of the red nucleus</BrainRegion>. There was a somatotopic arrangement in the labelled rubrospinal(RS) neurons: Those projecting to the <BrainRegion>cervical cord segments</BrainRegion> were located in the <BrainRegion>dorsal and dorsomedial regions of the red nucleus</BrainRegion> and those projecting to the <BrainRegion>lumbosacral cord segments</BrainRegion> were located in the <BrainRegion>ventral and ventrolateral regions of the nucleus</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Autoradiographic localization of hormone-concentrating cells in the brain of the female rhesus monkey.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>With autoradiographic procedures, cells which bind 3H-estradiol were found in <BrainRegion>preoptic</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>hypothalamic</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>limbic structures</BrainRegion> in the brains of ovariectomized, adult female rhesus monkeys. Estrogen-binding cells were seen in the <BrainRegion>medial preoptic  area</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>medial anterior hypothalamus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>ventromedial nucleus</BrainRegion>, and especially heavy labelling was seen throughout the extent of the <BrainRegion>arcuate (infundibular) nucleus</BrainRegion> of the <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion>. In <BrainRegion>limbic structures</BrainRegion>, cells in the <BrainRegion>bed nucleus of the stria terminalis</BrainRegion> and in the <BrainRegion>medial nucleus of the amygdala</BrainRegion> were well labelled. Systematic charting also revealed smaller numbers of estrogen-concentrating cells in other specific <BrainRegion>hypothalamic</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>limbic</BrainRegion> locations. In the <BrainRegion>anterior pituitary</BrainRegion>, significant numbers of basophils and acidophils were found to bind estrogen. <BrainRegion>Pars intermedia</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>posterior lobe</BrainRegion> were virtually unlabelled. In the uterus, heavily labelled cells were seen in the endometrial stroma and in the myometrium. These autoradiographic findings agree with results of parallel biochemical experiments. In monkeys injected with 3H-corticosterone, the most extensive high-intensity binding found with autoradiography was in the <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion>. Both pyramidal neurons and <BrainRegion>dentate gyrus</BrainRegion> granule cells were labelled. Biochemical experiments, also, showed highest cell nuclear accumulation of corticosterone in the <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion>. Findings with estradiol in the rhesus monkey extend to primates conclusions based on autoradiographic experiments with steroid sex hormones in wide variety of vertebrates, including fish, amphibians, birds, and various mammalian species (Morell st al., &apos;75a). All of these vertebrate forms have sex hormone-concentrating neurons, which are found in specific <BrainRegion>preoptic</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>hypothalamic</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>limbic structures</BrainRegion>. In the species studied, such hormone-concentrating neurons appear to be involved in the hormonal control of behavioral and <BrainRegion>pituitary</BrainRegion> function.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Optic synapse number but not density is constrained during regeneration onto surgically halved <BrainRegion>tectum</BrainRegion> in goldfish: HRP-EM evidence that optic fibers compete for fixed numbers of postsynaptic sites on the <BrainRegion>tectum</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The number of optic synapses in the half <BrainRegion>tectum</BrainRegion> of goldfish was counted by using an improved HRP-labeling protocol and a columnar sampling method that spanned the entire optic innervation layer, S-SO-SFGS. It was previously found by using this procedure in intact <BrainRegion>tectum</BrainRegion> that the normal number of optic synapses was regenerated by 30 days and maintained thereafter even in the absence of impulse activity. This suggested that the number of synapses in this system was intrinsically fixed. In order to examine whether this limit was imposed by optic fibers or by target cells, optic synapses were counted in surgically halved <BrainRegion>tecta</BrainRegion> which received compressed optic projections consisting of regenerating optic fibers from the <BrainRegion>entire retina</BrainRegion>. We reasoned that if synapse number is a function of the number of afferents, then there should be twice the normal number of optic synapses per column; on the other hand, if their number is fixed by target, then their number per column should be normal. We found that the number of optic (labeled) synapses was normal in sample columns from fish at 70 days and 160 days after optic nerve crush. Thus, <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> ganglion cells, on average, formed half as many synapses on the half <BrainRegion>tectum</BrainRegion> compared to intact <BrainRegion>tectum</BrainRegion>, indicating the number of optic synapses was limited by the <BrainRegion>tectum</BrainRegion>. The number of nonoptic (unlabeled) synapses was also found to be normal. By contrast, the S-SO-SFGS was found to be 88-103% thicker compared to normal fish, apparently because of a 20-fold increase in the number of optic fibers. As a result, the density of synapses was about half normal in half <BrainRegion>tecta</BrainRegion>, and so, in contrast to synapse number, synaptic density is not constrained during regeneration. We infer from these data that optic fibers compete for limited numbers of postsynaptic sites during regeneration and suggest that this competition promotes neural map refinement and the various plasticities described for this projection.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Localization of enkephalinergic neurons in the <BrainRegion>dorsolateral pontine tegmentum</BrainRegion> projecting to the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> of the cat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The <BrainRegion>dorsolateral pontine tegmentum</BrainRegion> of the cat is known to contain enkephalinergic neurons, with most of the enkephalin co-contained in the catecholaminergic neurons; however, enkephalinergic cells projecting to the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> have not been identified. This study employs retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase in combination with methionine-enkephalin or tyrosine hydroxylase immunocytochemistry to 1) determine the locations of <BrainRegion>pontospinal</BrainRegion> enkephalinergic neurons and 2) compare these with the locations of <BrainRegion>pontospinal</BrainRegion> catecholaminergic neurons. <BrainRegion>Pontospinal</BrainRegion> enkephalinergic neurons were observed in the <BrainRegion>nuclei locus coeruleus and subcoeruleus</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>Kölliker-Fuse nucleus</BrainRegion>. A high concentration of these neurons was evident in the <BrainRegion>Kölliker-Fuse nucleus</BrainRegion> when compared to the <BrainRegion>nuclei locus coeruleus and subcoeruleus</BrainRegion> (P less than .01). Both the enkephalinergic and catecholaminergic neurons projecting to the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> were located in the same general areas of the <BrainRegion>dorsolateral pontine tegmentum</BrainRegion> and there was no significant difference in the mean diameters of these two neuronal types (P greater than .05). Quantitative data concerning the <BrainRegion>pontospinal</BrainRegion> enkephalinergic neurons correlated well with previous data on <BrainRegion>pontospinal</BrainRegion> catecholaminergic neurons (Reddy et al., Brain Res. 491:144-149, &apos;89). A majority of the descending neurons from the <BrainRegion>dorsolateral pontine tegmentum</BrainRegion> contain enkephalin (72-80%) and catecholamine (80-87%). The observations suggest that enkephalin is contained in many of the <BrainRegion>pontospinal</BrainRegion> catecholaminergic neurons.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Substance P, neurotensin, enkephalin, and catecholamine-synthesizing enzymes: light microscopic localizations compared with autoradiographic label in solitary efferents to the rat <BrainRegion>parabrachial region</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The immunocytochemical localizations of substance P, neurotensin, enkephalin and the catecholamine-synthesizing enzymes tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine-beta-hydroxylase were examined in the rat <BrainRegion>parabrachial region</BrainRegion>. The immunoreactivity for each marker was compared with the distribution of superimposed autoradiographic labeling of <BrainRegion>parabrachial</BrainRegion> afferents after unilateral injection of 3H-amino acids into the <BrainRegion>caudal portion of the medial nucleus of the solitary trac</BrainRegion>t (m-NTS). Substance-P- and neurotensinlike immunoreactivity (SPLI and NTLI, respectively) were localized primarily in varicose processes in the <BrainRegion>ventrolateral quadrant of the parabrachial region</BrainRegion>. The SPLI and NTLI were differentially localized with respect to each other; however, both peptides were detected in regions of the <BrainRegion>parabrachial</BrainRegion> containing dense autoradiographic label. In contrast, enkephalinlike immunoreactivity (ELI), tyrosine hydroxylase, and dopamine-beta-hydroxylase were detected in processes and a few perikarya located outside the <BrainRegion>ventrolateral parabrachial region</BrainRegion>. The enkephalinlike immunoreactivity(ELI) was primarily in the dorsolateral, and the catecholamine-synthesizing enzymes were primarily in the <BrainRegion>medial parabrachial regions</BrainRegion> which contained sparse autoradiographic labeling of transported amino acids. We conclude that in the rat <BrainRegion>parabrachial region</BrainRegion>, SPLI and NTLI are contained within two distinct populations of afferents which may originate from perikarya in the <BrainRegion>caudal medial nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion>(m-NTS) , whereas enkephalinlike immunoreactivity(ELI) and the catecholamines are more likely to be found in other afferents or possibly in intrinsic neurons.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Morphology of neuroglia in the <BrainRegion>antennal lobes</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>mushroom bodies</BrainRegion> of the brain of the honeybee.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>We investigated the distribution and anatomical organization of glial cells in the <BrainRegion>antennal lobes</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>mushroom bodies</BrainRegion> of the honeybee. Reconstructions from serial sections, prepared according to the ethyl gallate method, revealed the entire morphology of glial cells in neuropiles, tracts, and the soma rind. The distribution of the glial cell bodies in the neuropiles was derived from the staining of cell nuclei with a fluorescent dye. There are glial cells of different shape in the soma rind which are wrapped around the neuronal cell bodies of the <BrainRegion>antennal lobes</BrainRegion> and the Kenyon cells of the <BrainRegion>mushroom bodies</BrainRegion>. Glial cells surround neuropilar areas such as the external and lateral sides of the glomeruli of the <BrainRegion>antennal lobes</BrainRegion>. Whereas we could not detect glia in the glomerular neuropile, glial cells with long processes are located in the core of the <BrainRegion>antennal lobe</BrainRegion>. Extensions of these glial cells also invade tracts containing the <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> projection neurons. A layer of glial cells separates the <BrainRegion>mushroom body</BrainRegion> neuropile from the surrounding <BrainRegion>protocerebral</BrainRegion> neuropile. The neuropile of the <BrainRegion>mushroom bodies</BrainRegion> is clearly compartmented by glial cells. There is a high density of astrocyte-like glia in a column of the <BrainRegion>pedunculus</BrainRegion> which can be followed to the <BrainRegion>ventral part of the alpha-lobe</BrainRegion>. A network of <BrainRegion>mushroom body</BrainRegion> intrinsic glial cells separates the alpha-lobe from the beta-lobe and the <BrainRegion>pedunculus</BrainRegion>. This anatomical description of glial cell types in olfactory information processing pathways of an insect brain provides a framework for further physiological studies of neuroglia in dissociated cell culture.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Biphasic <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> neurogenesis in the brush-tailed possum, Trichosurus vulpecula: further evidence for the mechanisms involved in formation of ganglion cell density gradients.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>We investigated cell generation in the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> of the brush-tailed possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) by using tritiated (3H)-thymidine labelling of newly generated cells. Animals aged between postnatal day (P) 5 and 85 each received a single injection of 3H-thymidine. Following autoradiographic processing, maps of labelled cells were constructed from retinal sections. <BrainRegion>Retinal</BrainRegion> cell generation takes place in two phases, the first is concluding in the <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> periphery at P53 as the second is seen to commence in <BrainRegion>midtemporal retina</BrainRegion>. In the first phase, cells in <BrainRegion>central retina</BrainRegion> are generated earlier than those in peripheral regions. In the second phase, cells complete their final division in <BrainRegion>midtemporal retina</BrainRegion> first and in the periphery last. Cells generated in the first phase comprise virtually all cells in the ganglion cell layer, amacrine cells, horizontal cells, and cones. Ganglion cells are produced at a slightly earlier stage than displaced amacrine cells, horizontal cells, or cones. Amacrine cells in the inner nuclear layer are the final cells produced in the first phase. When ganglion cells and amacrine cells are pooled, their combined rate of production matches that of the other cell types. These data indicate that the ratio of displaced amacrine cells: horizontal cells: cones: combined ganglion cells and amacrine cells does not change throughout development. However, the ratio of ganglion cells:macrines changes steadily as development proceeds to favour amacrine cells. In the second phase, sparse numbers of nonganglion cells in the ganglion cell layer and large numbers of bipolar and Müller cells are produced along with all rods. The two phases in the possum are similar to those seen in the wallaby, the quokka. However, fewer cells are added in <BrainRegion>central retina</BrainRegion> in the possum than in the quokka and cell addition continues for a more extended period in the periphery in the possum. We suggest that this difference in cell addition could account for the development of a more pronounced visual streak of <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> ganglion cells in the possum than in the quokka. A comparison of possum <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> cell generation with that of other marsupials adds support for the &quot;homochrony theory."</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Postnatal development of connectional specificity of corticospinal terminals in the cat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The purpose of this study was to examine postnatal development of connectional specificity of corticospinal terminals. We labeled a small population of <BrainRegion>primary motor cortex</BrainRegion> neurons with the anterograde tracer biotinylated dextran amine. We reconstructed individual corticospinal segmental axon terminals in the <BrainRegion>spinal gray matter</BrainRegion> in cats of varying postnatal ages and adults. We found that at days 25 and 35 the segmental termination field of reconstructed axons was large, estimated to cover more than half of the contralateral gray matter. Branches and varicosities were sparse and had a relatively uniform distribution. When we examined the terminal fields of multiple axons, reconstructed over the same set of spinal sections (120-200 microm), we found that there was extensive overlap. By day 55, the morphology and termination fields had changed remarkably. There were many short branches, organized into discrete clusters, and varicosities were preferentially located within these clusters. The termination field of individual axons was substantially reduced compared with that of younger animals, and there was minimal overlap between the terminals of neighboring corticospinal neurons. In adults, a further reduction was seen in the spatial extent of terminals, branching, and varicosity density. Termination overlap was not substantially different from that in PD 55 animals. Development of spatially restricted clusters of short terminal branches and dense axonal varicosities occurred just prior to development of the motor map in <BrainRegion>primary motor cortex</BrainRegion> and may be necessary for ensuring that the corticospinal system can exert a dominant influence on skilled limb movement control in maturity.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Cholinergic innervation of the <BrainRegion>amygdaloid complex</BrainRegion> in the human brain and its alterations in old age and Alzheimer&apos;s disease.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The cholinergic innervation of the human <BrainRegion>amygdaloid complex</BrainRegion> was studied immunohistochemically with a choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) antibody in eight brains: five control and three with Alzheimer&apos;s disease (AD). All <BrainRegion>amygdaloid nuclei</BrainRegion> displayed choline acetyltransferase(ChAT) -immunopositive axons and varicosities. The density of these axons reached levels that were higher than in any other part of the <BrainRegion>forebrain</BrainRegion> except for the <BrainRegion>striatum</BrainRegion>. The highest level of choline acetyltransferase(ChAT) -immunopositive profiles was seen in the <BrainRegion>basolateral nucleus</BrainRegion> and the second highest in the <BrainRegion>lateral part of the central nucleus</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>basomedial, accessory basal, and cortical nuclei</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>amygdalohippocampal and cortico-amygdaloid transition areas</BrainRegion>, as well as the <BrainRegion>anterior amygdaloid area</BrainRegion>, showed a moderate density of choline acetyltransferase(ChAT) -positive varicosities and fibers. The <BrainRegion>lateral nucleus</BrainRegion> displayed a relatively low density of cholinergic innervation, and there were only rare choline acetyltransferase(ChAT) -positive fibers in the <BrainRegion>medial nucleus</BrainRegion>. Although the level of cholinergic innervation in the <BrainRegion>lateral nucleus</BrainRegion> was relatively lower than in many of the other <BrainRegion>amygdaloid nuclei</BrainRegion>, it was approximately equivalent to that of <BrainRegion>entorhinal cortex</BrainRegion>, a region that receives one of the heaviest cholinergic inputs in the <BrainRegion>cerebral cortex</BrainRegion>. The distribution of the cholinergic fibers as studied by choline acetyltransferase(ChAT) immunohistochemistry was nearly identical to that observed with AChE histochemistry. Quantitative densitometry in control specimens showed that there was no decline of <BrainRegion>amygdaloid</BrainRegion> cholinergic input when middle-aged subjects were compared with senescent subjects. In Alzheimer&apos;s disease(AD) there was a severe and regionally selective depletion of this innervation in the <BrainRegion>amygdaloid complex</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>cortical, accessory basal, and lateral nuclei</BrainRegion> displayed the most severe loss of choline acetyltransferase(ChAT) -positive profiles, whereas the <BrainRegion>basolateral, and especially the central, nuclei</BrainRegion> displayed relatively little change. There was no consistent relationship between the loss of cholinergic fibers and the density of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in <BrainRegion>amygdaloid nuclei</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Suckling stimulus suppresses messenger RNA for tyrosine hydroxylase in <BrainRegion>arcuate</BrainRegion> neurons during lactation.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) mRNA in tuberoinfundibular dopamine (TIDA) neurons is suppressed during lactation but rebounds upon pup removal. A time course of Tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) mRNA changes after pup removal revealed three phases: (1) a nuclear phase (evident 1.5 hours after pup removal, maximal at 3 hours) with Tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) mRNA appearing in 1 or 2 nuclear loci with little or no change in cytoplasmic mRNA; (2) a cytoplasmic phase (noted 6 hours after pup removal, peaked 12-24 hours) with a significant increase in total Tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) mRNA levels mainly in the cytoplasm; and (3) a stabilization phase (24-48 hours after pup removal) when nuclear signals were low and cytoplasmic RNA showed a slight decline with extension of RNA clusters into the cell dendrites. In rats whose pups could suckle only on one side, Tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) was up-regulated only on the side contralateral to nipple blockade. These data indicate that after suckling terminates, Tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) up-regulation is evident at 1.5 hours, but 6 hours is needed before the cells transport sufficient mRNA into the cytoplasm. The rapid signaling of Tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) up-regulation stems from the fact that the tuberoinfundibular dopamine(TIDA) neurons respond to neural signals from termination of suckling.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Differential responses to branched and unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbons in the rat olfactory system.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>In an effort to understand mammalian <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> processing, we have been describing the responses to systematically different odorants in the glomerular layer of the <BrainRegion>main olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> of rats. Previously, we demonstrated chemotopically organized and distinct olfactory responses to a homologous series of straight-chained alkanes that consisted of purely hydrocarbon structures, indicating that hydrocarbon chains could serve as molecular features in the combinatorial coding of odorant information. To better understand the processing of hydrocarbon odorants, we now have examined responses to other types of chemical changes in these kinds of molecules, namely, branching and carbon-carbon bond saturation. To this end, we used the [14C]2-deoxyglucose method to determine glomerular responses to a group of eight-carbon branched alkane isomers, unsaturated octenes (double-bonded), and octynes (triple-bonded). In contrast to the differential responses we observed previously for straight-chained alkanes of differing carbon number, the rat olfactory system was not particularly sensitive to these variations in branching and bond saturation. This result was unexpected, given the distinct molecular conformations and property profiles of the odorants. The similarity in activity patterns was paralleled by a similarity in spontaneous perceptual responses measured using a habituation assay. These results demonstrate again the functional relationship between bulbar activity patterns and odor perception. The results further suggest that the olfactory system does not respond equally to all aspects of odorant chemistry, functioning as a specific, rather than a general, chemical analysis system.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>The <BrainRegion>ventral striatopallidothalamic</BrainRegion> projection: I. The striatopallidal link originating in the <BrainRegion>striatal parts of the olfactory tubercle</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The projections from the <BrainRegion>striatal part of the olfactory tubercle</BrainRegion> were examined in rats, both with the aid of experimental silver impregnation methods following superficial laminar heat lesions of the <BrainRegion>tubercle</BrainRegion> and by the use of anterograde transport of Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) following injections of the lectin in the dense cell layer of the <BrainRegion>tubercle</BrainRegion>. Retrograde transport of fluorescent substances following injections of the tracer in the multiform layer of the <BrainRegion>tubercle</BrainRegion> were used to corroborate the results obtained by the anterograde transport and degeneration methods. The main and apparently only significant termination from the <BrainRegion>striatal</BrainRegion> cells in the <BrainRegion>olfactory tubercle</BrainRegion> is located immediately deep to the dense cell layer in areas that could be identified as part of the <BrainRegion>ventral pallidum</BrainRegion> on the basis of either the Nissl method or glutamate decarboxylase immunocytochemistry. Whereas a mediolateral topography is generally maintained by the <BrainRegion>ventral striatopallidal</BrainRegion> pathway originating in the dense cell layer, there is a considerable spread of the projection in the rostrocaudal direction. The dense projection field of the <BrainRegion>olfactory tubercle</BrainRegion> component of the <BrainRegion>ventral striatopallidal</BrainRegion> pathway permeates the <BrainRegion>ventrolateral part of the ventral pallidum</BrainRegion>, thereby complementing the termination of the <BrainRegion>accumbens</BrainRegion> projection to the more <BrainRegion>mediodorsal parts of the ventral pallidum</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>The timetable of laminar neurogenesis contributes to the specification of <BrainRegion>cortical areas</BrainRegion> in mouse <BrainRegion>isocortex</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>In the <BrainRegion>primate visual cortex</BrainRegion>, the birthdate of neurons in homologous layers differ on either side of the 17-18 border suggesting that there might be different timetables of laminar histogenesis in these two areas (Dehay et al. [1993] Nature 366:464-466 and Kennedy et al. [1996] Soc. Neurosci. Abst. 22:525). Because of the potential importance of these findings for understanding mechanisms that generate areal identity, we have developed an experimental approach that makes it possible to accurately compute the timetable of laminar histogenesis from birthdating experiments. Here we report the results of an exhaustive examination of the tempo of layer production in five <BrainRegion>cortical areas</BrainRegion> of the mouse. Tritiated thymidine pulse injections were made during embryonic development and labeled neurons were examined in three <BrainRegion>frontoparietal areas</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>areas 3, 4, and 6</BrainRegion>) and two <BrainRegion>occipital areas</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>areas 17 and 18a</BrainRegion>) of the adult <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion>. The correlation between the radial distribution of neurons and the intensities of labeling enabled us to reliably identify first generation neurons (i.e., those neurons that quit the cell-cycle in the first round of mitosis after injection). For each <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> layer, the percentage of first generation neurons with respect to the total number of neurons def identify first generation neurons(i.e.) a laminar labeling index. Changes of the laminar labeling index over t identify first generation neurons(i.e.) determ identify first generation neurons(i.e.) the t identify first generation neurons(i.e.) able of layer formation. The onset and duration of layer formation was identify first generation neurons(i.e.) tical in the two <BrainRegion>occipital areas</BrainRegion>. This finding contrasted with the <BrainRegion>frontoparietal areas</BrainRegion> where there were important differences in the timing of infragranular and granular layer formation and not identify first generation neurons(i.e.) bly production of layers VIa, V, and IV occurs earlier in <BrainRegion>area 3</BrainRegion> than in <BrainRegion>area 6</BrainRegion>. The timing of laminar production of <BrainRegion>areas 17 and 18a</BrainRegion> resembles more that of <BrainRegion>area 3</BrainRegion> than that of <BrainRegion>area 6</BrainRegion>. With respect to <BrainRegion>areas 3 and 6</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>area 4</BrainRegion> shows an intermediate but significantly different t identify first generation neurons(i.e.) able of layer production. These marked areal differences in the t identify first generation neurons(i.e.) able of laminar histogenesis contrasted with the relat identify first generation neurons(i.e.) homogeneity within areas so that we have been able to demonstrate that the interareal differences are not merely the expression of known neurogenic gradients. These results suggest that in the mouse <BrainRegion>frontoparietal isocortex</BrainRegion>, neighbouring regions of the ventricular zone that will g identify first generation neurons(i.e.) r identify first generation neurons(i.e.) to distinct areas follow distinct programs of layer production. These areal differences occur before <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> innervation and suggest an early regionalisation of laminar histogenesis.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Scanning electron microscopy of the <BrainRegion>subarachnoid space</BrainRegion> in the dog. V. Macrophages challenged by bacillus Calmette-Guerin.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Mongrel dogs were anesthetized intraperitoneally with pentobarbitol. One cc of <BrainRegion>cerebrospinal fluid</BrainRegion> was drawn through a needle inserted into the <BrainRegion>cisterna magna</BrainRegion> and mixed with 1 cc (4-9 million viable BCG organisms) of freeze-dried bacillus Calmette-Guerin. One minute later this mixture was injected by the same needle into the <BrainRegion>cisterna magna</BrainRegion>. At 1 and 12 days postinjection, experimental animals were perfused with buffered aldehydes. Samples of the leptomeninges were post-fixed in OsO4 and routinely prepared for scanning and transmission electron microscopy<BrainRegion>. Leptomeningeal</BrainRegion> samples of untreated, control animals were similarly prepared. Scanning and transmission microscopy confirm that free cells resting on the <BrainRegion>subarachnoid</BrainRegion> linings and within the subpial connective tissue space of control animals possess the morphology of macrophages (Malloy and Low, &apos;76). Viable BCG in the <BrainRegion>subarachnoid space</BrainRegion> produces a 3-fold increase in the free cell population of the <BrainRegion>leptomeninges</BrainRegion> in 24 hours and a 10-fold increase in 12 days. These cells tend to form associations varying from loose aggregates to tight clusters. Approximately 80% of these free cells express macrophage morphology, with abundant plasma-lemmal microappendages and cytoplasmic vacuoles. Transmission electron microscopy of the free cell population of BCG-stimulated animals reveals at least two other members of the leukocyte series on the <BrainRegion>leptomeningeal</BrainRegion> linings.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>The identification of relay neurons in the <BrainRegion>dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion> of monkeys using horseradish peroxidase.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Intraaxonal retrograde transport of the protein horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was used to identify relay neurons in the <BrainRegion>dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion> (LGN) of owl (Aotus trivirgatus) and rhesus (Macaca mulatta) monkeys. In both species, from 94.1-98.6% of the neurons within columns extending through both parvocellular and magnocellular layers were labeled following injection of horseradish peroxidase(HRP) into <BrainRegion>striate cortex</BrainRegion>. Labeled neurons were also identified in the thin ventral-most S(0) Layers. Although most of the cells within the thin interlaminar regions in the <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(LGN) of both species were labeled following injections of horseradish peroxidase(HRP) , many unlabeled neurons were identified within the large cell-rich interlaminar region (IL) between the internal parvocellular and internal magnocellular layers in the <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(LGN) of the owl monkey, suggesting that interlaminar region(IL) may be a specialized region containing a large number of intrinsic neurons. Finally, measurement of the cell diameters of neurons within the densely labeled areas in relay layers revealed that labeled and unlabeled neurons could not be distinguished on the basis of cell body size alone and that some of the smallest cells of the <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(LGN) project to <BrainRegion>striate cortex</BrainRegion>. These findings indicate that nearly all of the neurons of the main relay layers of the <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(LGN) in these two primates are relay cells and that the organization of the <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(LGN) in primates may differ significantly from that of other mammals with respect to the percentage of interneurons.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Synaptic innervation of <BrainRegion>midbrain</BrainRegion> dopaminergic neurons by glutamate-enriched terminals in the squirrel monkey.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The excitatory amino acid, glutamate, has long been thought to be a transmitter that plays a major role in the control of the firing pattern of <BrainRegion>midbrain</BrainRegion> dopaminergic neurons. The present study was aimed at elucidating the anatomical substrate that underlies the functional interaction between glutamatergic afferents and <BrainRegion>midbrain</BrainRegion> dopaminergic neurons in the squirrel monkey. To do this, we combined preembedding immunocytochemistry for tyrosine hydroxylase and calbindin D-28k with postembedding immunostaining for glutamate. On the basis of their ultrastructural features, three types (so-called types I, II, and III) of glutamate-enriched terminals were found to form asymmetric synapses with dendrites and perikarya of <BrainRegion>midbrain</BrainRegion> dopaminergic neurons. The type I terminals accounted for more than 70% of the total population of glutamate-enriched boutons in contact with dopaminergic cells in the dorsal and ventral tiers of the <BrainRegion>substantia nigra pars compacta</BrainRegion> as well as in the <BrainRegion>ventral tegmental area</BrainRegion>, whereas 5-20% of the glutamatergic synapses with dopaminergic neurons involved the two other types of terminals. The major finding of our study is that the glutamate-enriched boutons were involved in 70% of the axodendritic synapses in the <BrainRegion>ventral tegmental area</BrainRegion>. In contrast, less than 40% of the boutons in contact with dopaminergic dendrites were immunoreactive for glutamate in the <BrainRegion>dorsal and ventral tiers of the substantia nigra pars compacta</BrainRegion>. Approximately 50% of the terminals in contact with the perikarya of the different populations of <BrainRegion>midbrain</BrainRegion> dopaminergic neurons displayed glutamate immunoreactivity. In conclusion, our findings provide the first evidence that glutamate-enriched terminals form synapses with <BrainRegion>midbrain</BrainRegion> dopaminergic neurons in primates. The fact that the proportion of glutamatergic boutons in contact with dopaminergic cells is higher in the <BrainRegion>ventral tegmental area</BrainRegion> than in the <BrainRegion>substantia nigra pars compacta</BrainRegion> suggests that the different groups of <BrainRegion>midbrain</BrainRegion> dopaminergic neurons are modulated differently by extrinsic glutamatergic afferents in primates.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Uncrossed and crossed projections from the <BrainRegion>upper cervical spinal cord</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>cerebellar nuclei</BrainRegion> in the rat, studied by anterograde axonal tracing.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>In the <BrainRegion>upper cervical spinal segments</BrainRegion>, neurons in the medial part of lamina VI give rise to uncrossed <BrainRegion>spinocerebellar</BrainRegion> axons, whereas the <BrainRegion>central cervical nucleus</BrainRegion> (CCN) and neurons in laminae VII and VIII give rise to crossed <BrainRegion>spinocerebellar</BrainRegion> axons. Using anterograde labeling with biotinylated dextran in the rat, we examined the projections of these neuronal groups to the <BrainRegion>cerebellar nuclei</BrainRegion>. Uncrossed and crossed projections were distinguished by <BrainRegion>cerebellar</BrainRegion> lesions placed on the side contralateral or ipsilateral to the tracer injections confined to the <BrainRegion>second and third cervical spinal segments</BrainRegion> (C2 and C3, respectively). Labeled terminals of uncrossed projections were seen in the middle, dorsal, and ventrolateral parts of the <BrainRegion>middle subdivision and in the ventral part of the caudomedial subdivision of the medial nucleus</BrainRegion>. In the <BrainRegion>anterior interpositus nucleus</BrainRegion>, terminals were seen in the middle of the mediolateral extent, whereas, in the <BrainRegion>posterior interpositus nucleus</BrainRegion>, they were seen in lateral and caudal parts. The terminals of crossed projections from the <BrainRegion>cervical nucleus</BrainRegion>(CCN) were distributed ventrally in <BrainRegion>medial to ventrolateral parts of the middle subdivision of the medial nucleus</BrainRegion>. Some terminals were seen in the <BrainRegion>caudomedial subdivision of the medial nucleus</BrainRegion>. In the <BrainRegion>anterior interpositus nucleus</BrainRegion>, labeled terminals were seen mainly in rostromedial parts, whereas, in the <BrainRegion>posterior interpositus nucleus</BrainRegion>, they were seen in caudal and dorsal parts of the medial half. The present study suggests that the medial lamina VI group and the <BrainRegion>cervical nucleus</BrainRegion>(CCN) in the upper cervical segments project to the different areas of the <BrainRegion>cerebellar nuclei</BrainRegion> and are concerned with different functions.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Morphology of GABAergic neurons in the <BrainRegion>inferior colliculus</BrainRegion> of the cat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The goal of the present study was to provide a comprehensive and quantitative description of neurons immunoreactive for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the <BrainRegion>inferior colliculus</BrainRegion> (IC) of the cat. Neurons were investigated with two different antisera and two different incubation methods. Free-floating frozen or vibratome-cut sections were incubated either with an antiserum to glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) or to gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) conjugated to protein with glutaraldehyde. Additional 1.5-microns-thick sections were incubated with the gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) antiserum after embedding and removal of the plastic. Quantitative data were obtained from much of this material. Despite the use of these different antisera and reaction methods, the results obtained were remarkably similar. The results show that glutamic acid decarboxylase(GAD) - or gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) -positive neurons represent a significant population of cells in the <BrainRegion>central nucleus of the inferior colliculus</BrainRegion>(IC) , up to 20% of the neurons. Most of these neurons have large or medium-sized perikarya. In contrast, immunonegative neurons are medium-sized or small. Many gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) -positive neurons had proximal dendrites or somata oriented in parallel to the fibrodendritic laminae of the <BrainRegion>central nucleus</BrainRegion> and are presumed to be disc-shaped neurons. Other have an orthogonal orientation and are presumed to be stellate cells. Large gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) -positive neurons form two groups, those with many axosomatic endings and those with few. Collectively, these observations suggest that there are several types of gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) ergic neuron in the <BrainRegion>central nucleus</BrainRegion> and, by extension, that these may participate in many types of inhibitory circuits.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Patterns of synaptic input on corticocortical and corticothalamic cells in the cat <BrainRegion>visual cortex</BrainRegion>. II. The axon initial segment.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>In the present study we examined the synaptology of the axon initial segments (AISs) of three populations of retrogradely labeled pyramidal cells: <BrainRegion>callosal</BrainRegion>, corticothalamic, and <BrainRegion>ipsilateral corticocortical</BrainRegion> projecting cells. The cells were labeled by horseradish peroxidase injected into the <BrainRegion>contralateral visual cortex</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>, or <BrainRegion>area 19 of the ipsilateral hemisphere</BrainRegion>. The axon initial segments(AISs) of these cells were completely reconstructed from tracings of serial electron micrographs and the number and type of synapses ending on them determined. These data were compared with that described in the companion paper (Fariñas and DeFelipe, J Comp Neurol 1991; 304:53-69), in which the ultrastructure and synaptology of the somata of <BrainRegion>callosal and corticothalamic</BrainRegion> cells was investigated. Together, these data permit comparisons to be made between the somatic and axonic innervation of the same cells. Our results show that each population of efferent cells examined received a characteristic and rather homogeneous number (in comparison with the number of axosomatic synapses) of axoaxonic synapses: 16 to 23 for axon initial segments(AISs) of <BrainRegion>callosal</BrainRegion> cells, 22 to 28 for <BrainRegion>ipsilateral corticocortical</BrainRegion> cells, and 1 to 5 for corticothalamic cells. Since most axoaxonic synapses are likely to be GABAergic, it is concluded that each population of pyramidal cells receives a distinct GABAergic inhibitory synaptic profile.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Distribution and innervation of lateral line organs in the axolotl.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The lateral line system in axolotls consists of three types of receptors and the <BrainRegion>cranial nerves</BrainRegion> that innervate them. Superficial neuromasts, which are mechanoreceptors, are distributed in lines on both the head and trunk. Eight cephalic and three trunk lines can be distinguished on the basis of their innervation and differences in the orientation of the major axes of their neuromasts. A combination of histological techniques reveals that five separate pairs of <BrainRegion>cranial nerves</BrainRegion> innervate the neuromasts: anterodorsal lateral line nerves innervate cephalic supraorbital and infraorbital lines; anteroventral lateral line nerves innervate cephalic angular, oral, jugal, and preoperculomandibular lines of the cheek and lower jaw; middle and supratemporal lateral line nerves innervate the cephalic postotic lines; and posterior lateral line nerves innervate the trunk lines. In addition to lines of neuromasts, a second class of mechanoreceptive lateral line organs, pit organs, also occur on the head. Pit organs are smaller than neuromasts but are innervated in a manner identical to that of neuromasts: the sensory hair cells of a single pit organ are innervated by two afferent fibers and a single efferent fiber. Although they occur in localized clusters rather than lines, the four distinct pit organ clusters occurring in axolotls are referred to as the anterior, middle, middle cheek, and gular pit lines as they appear to be homologous to the similarly named pit lines in fishes on the basis of their topography and innervation. In addition to neuromasts and pit organs, ampullary organs comprise a third class of lateral line receptors and are restricted to the head. These electroreceptors occur singly or in small clusters adjacent to the neuromast lines and along the base of the external gills. The ampullary organs adjacent to the supraorbital and infraorbital lines are innervated by the anterodorsal lateral line nerves, whereas all other <BrainRegion>ampullary organs</BrainRegion> of the head are innervated by the anteroventral lateral line nerves. Thus <BrainRegion>postotic ampullary organs</BrainRegion> and neuromasts of the head are innervated by different lateral line nerves. Examination of the sensory ganglia of the lateral line nerves with respect to the ganglia of the other cranial nerves indicates varying levels of fusion. The ganglia of the anterodorsal lateral line and profundal-trigeminal nerves are totally separate throughout their rostrocaudal extent. The ganglia of the anteroventral lateral line and facial nerves form a fused ganglionic complex with the larger pigmented cells of the <BrainRegion>anteroventral nerve</BrainRegion> occupying the dorsal portion of the ganglionic complex.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Development of intracerebral dopaminergic grafts: a combined immunohistochemical and autoradiographic study of its time course and environmental influences.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The aim of the study was to obtain a description of some aspects of the development of intracerebral dopaminergic grafts, namely, the time course of the glial reaction and its relation to cell division on one hand, and the development of graft-originated innervation and its dependence on adequate matching of the implanted neurons and target site on the other hand. Cell suspensions obtained from the <BrainRegion>mesencephalon</BrainRegion> or <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion> of embryonic day (ED) 14 rat embryos were implanted into the <BrainRegion>striatum</BrainRegion> or <BrainRegion>lateral hypothalamus</BrainRegion> of adult rats following the destruction of the nigrostriatal system of the hosts. Animals were sacrificed at different postimplantation times, and the development of the graft was followed by immunohistochemistry by using antisera directed against tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) or glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFA). Furthermore, the existence of cell division at various times following implantation was examined by performing autoradiography on immunostained sections after prior intraventricular administration of 3H-thymidine to the host. The first stage of the development of intracerebral grafts was characterized by the existence of intense cell division within the grafted tissue, lasting about 2 weeks, and also in the host tissue surrounding the graft, lasting only about 6 days. The cell division in the host tissue was paralleled by the existence of a strong glial reaction which, however, did not extend into the graft itself. Glial reaction in the host tissue gradually decreased at later times and disappeared by 4 weeks postimplantation without leaving behind a noticeable glial scar. The graft itself was, however, transiently filled with a population of reactive astroglial cells between 3 and 6 weeks postimplantation. Within grafts of <BrainRegion>mesencephalic</BrainRegion> tissue located in the <BrainRegion>striatum</BrainRegion> tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) -positive neurons were distributed evenly at short times postimplantation (2-6 days). At later time a compartmentation could be observed, with tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) -positive neurons being aligned along the graft-host interface or clustered within the graft itself. Innervation of the host tissue by tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) -positive fibers increased between 1 and 6 weeks postimplantation. On the other hand, no compartmentation and reinnervation of surrounding host tissue was observed for intrahypothalamic grafts of <BrainRegion>mesencephalic</BrainRegion> tissue or intrastriatal grafts of <BrainRegion>hypothalamic</BrainRegion> tissue. This last observation indicates that adequate matching of implanted neurons and target tissue plays an important role in the development of intracerebral dopaminergic grafts.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Presence and biological activity of a GnRH-like factor in the nervous system of Helisoma trivolvis.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) constitutes a family of neuropeptides found throughout the vertebrates. Although a Gonadotropin-releasing hormone(GnRH) -like peptide has also been isolated from yeast (alpha-mating factor), the presence of Gonadotropin-releasing hormone(GnRH) has not been clearly demonstrated in invertebrate phyla. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that Gonadotropin-releasing hormone(GnRH) -like peptides are present and functional in the central nervous system (CNS) of the gastropod mollusc, Helisoma trivolvis. The presence of a Gonadotropin-releasing hormone(GnRH) -like peptide was examined by three methods: (1) in immunofluorescence studies with four different antibodies generated against several Gonadotropin-releasing hormone(GnRH) peptides, select neurons and putative neurosecretory cells were specifically and consistently labelled throughout the central nervous system(CNS) ; (2) reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and radioimmunoassay (RIA) analysis revealed a Gonadotropin-releasing hormone(GnRH) -like factor which co-migrates with mammalian (m) Gonadotropin-releasing hormone(GnRH) ; and (3) in bioactivity experiments, extracts of Helisoma trivolvis central nervous system(CNS) mimicked Gonadotropin-releasing hormone(GnRH) in stimulating gonadotropin release from dispersed goldfish <BrainRegion>pituitary</BrainRegion> cells in static culture. Two functional assays were carried out to examine the potential biological roles of Gonadotropin-releasing hormone(GnRH) -like peptides in Helisoma. (1) Intracellular recordings of left-parietal and visceral ganglion neurons revealed diverse electrophysiological responses to m Gonadotropin-releasing hormone(GnRH) . These effects were attenuated by a m Gonadotropin-releasing hormone(GnRH) antagonist. (2) Addition of m Gonadotropin-releasing hormone(GnRH) arrested neurite outgrowth in a subpopulation of dissociated embryonic Helisoma neurons in culture. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that a m Gonadotropin-releasing hormone(GnRH) -like peptide is an important neuropeptide in Helisoma. A hypothesis is presented that Gonadotropin-releasing hormone(GnRH) -like peptides may be ancient factors that are conserved both structurally and functionally in the evolution of animals.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Intraneuronal localization of Nogo-A in the rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Nogo-A is known to be a myelin-associated protein with strong inhibitory effect on neurite outgrowth and has been considered one of the major factors that hinder fiber regeneration in the central nervous system. Recent studies have demonstrated widespread occurrence of nogo-A mRNA and Nogo-A protein in neurons. Our concurrent immunohistochemical study substantiated the widespread distribution of neuronal Nogo-A. The present study was thus focused on its intraneuronal distribution in the central nervous system, using Western blotting, immunohistochemical, and immunogold electron microscopic techniques. Western blotting of the nucleus, cytoplasm, and membrane subcellular fractions of the <BrainRegion>cerebellum</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> tissues demonstrated that all three fractions contained Nogo-A. Nogo-A immunoreactivity could be identified under confocal microscope in the nucleus, perikayon, and proximal dendrite and along the cell membrane. Under the electron microscope, the perikaryonal Nogo-A immunogold particles were mainly distributed at polyribosomes and rough endoplasmic reticulum, suggesting its relationship with translation process. The immunogold particles could also be found beneath or on the plasma membrane. In the nucleus, the Nogo-A immunogold particles were found to be localized at the chromatins of the nucleus, indicating its possible involvement in gene transcription. The presence of Nogo-A in the nucleus was further supported by transfection of COS-7L cells with nogo-A. This study provides the first immunocytochemical evidence for intraneuronal distribution of Nogo-A. Apparently, the significance of Nogo-A in the central nervous system is far more complex than what has been envisioned.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Vascular niche for adult <BrainRegion>hippocampal</BrainRegion> neurogenesis.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The thin lamina between the <BrainRegion>hippocampal hilus</BrainRegion> and granule cell layer, or subgranule zone (SGZ), is an area of active proliferation within the adult <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion> known to generate new neurons throughout adult life. Although the neuronal fate of many dividing cells is well documented, little information is available about the phenotypes of cells in S-phase or how the dividing cells might interact with neighboring cells in the process of neurogenesis. Here, we make the unexpected observation that dividing cells are found in dense clusters associated with the vasculature and roughly 37% of all dividing cells are immunoreactive for endothelial markers. Most of the newborn endothelial cells disappear over several weeks, suggesting that neurogenesis is intimately associated with a process of active vascular recruitment and subsequent remodeling. The present data provide the first evidence that adult neurogenesis occurs within an angiogenic niche. This environment may provide a novel interface where mesenchyme-derived cells and circulating factors influence plasticity in the adult central nervous system.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Corneal and periocular representation within the <BrainRegion>trigeminal sensory complex</BrainRegion> in the cat studied with transganglionic transport of horseradish peroxidase.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The central projections of afferent fibers from the <BrainRegion>cornea</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>infraorbital, infratrochlear, frontal, lacrimal and auriculotemporal nerves</BrainRegion> were investigated by means of the transganglionic transport of horseradish peroxidase. Afferent projections to the <BrainRegion>dorsal horn of the medulla</BrainRegion> are organized along both the rostrocaudal axis and the ventrolateral to dorsomedial margin of the <BrainRegion>medullary dorsal horn</BrainRegion>. An inverted but discontinuous facial representation exists through the restrocaudal axis of the <BrainRegion>dorsal horn of the medulla</BrainRegion> with perioral and nasal receptive fields innervated by the infratrochlear nerves represented rostral to the progressively more posterior receptive fields innervated by the <BrainRegion>frontal, lacrimal and auriculotemporal nerves</BrainRegion>, respectively. The organization of the primary afferents is not uniform over the laminae of the <BrainRegion>dorsal horn of the medulla</BrainRegion>; the projections from the different nerves show the least overlap in lamina II, while overlap is most extensive in laminae I and V. The sensory projection from the <BrainRegion>cornea</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>medullary dorsal horn</BrainRegion> is most dense in laminae I and II. All nerves, including those innervating the <BrainRegion>cornea</BrainRegion>, project to the <BrainRegion>interpolar, oral and principal trigeminal nuclei</BrainRegion> and are somatotopically organized. Projections to the <BrainRegion>reticular formation</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>contralateral trigeminal sensory complex</BrainRegion> were not found in this study. These results support the organization of the <BrainRegion>dorsal horn of the medulla</BrainRegion> proposed by Déjerine (&apos;14) and show that this organization is most evident for the primary afferent projections to lamina II.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>SNAP-25 regulation during adrenal gland development: comparison with differentiation markers and other SNAREs.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Synaptosomal-associated protein of 25 kDa (SNAP-25) is one of a limited number of soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion attachment protein receptors (SNAREs) that play a major role in membrane docking of synaptic vesicles and secretory granules during regulated exocytosis. We have previously shown that Synaptosomal-associated protein of 25 kDa(SNAP-25) levels differ between noradrenergic and adrenergic chromaffin cell populations of the adult adrenal gland. We examine Synaptosomal-associated protein of 25 kDa(SNAP-25) expression by immunofluoresence in cells of the sympathoadrenal lineage in the rat during late embryonic and postnatal development. In parallel, tyrosine hydroxylase was used to identify sympathoadrenal cells, phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase to distinguish adrenergic from noradrenergic chromaffin cells, and chromogranin A to define the presence of secretory granules. In addition, Synaptosomal-associated protein of 25 kDa(SNAP-25) protein and mRNA levels were followed in adrenal gland extracts by immunoblotting and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Protein levels were compared with those of other molecules also implicated in organelle trafficking, including syntaxin 1 and vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP-2) and the nonneuronal analogues SNAP-23 and cellubrevin. This study provides evidence that Synaptosomal-associated protein of 25 kDa(SNAP-25) is expressed early during development in sympathoadrenal neurons and migrating cells. It is detected in intra-adrenal chromoblasts as soon as they enter the adrenal primordium. Its differential expression between catecholamine chromaffin cell phenotypes is already evident from the 17th embryonic day, future noradrenergic cells appearing to express higher levels than adrenergic cells. The granule maturation marker chromogranin A is expressed in chromaffin cells later than Synaptosomal-associated protein of 25 kDa(SNAP-25) . Both Synaptosomal-associated protein of 25 kDa(SNAP-25) protein and mRNA increased rapidly in the adrenal gland in the perinatal period to peak during the first postnatal week, after which levels dropped dramatically to adult values. In contrast, levels of both syntaxin and SNAP-23 appeared to remain fairly constant throughout adrenal gland development. VAMP-2 expression increased gradually around birth to reach maximal levels during the first two postnatal weeks, and then decreased slightly. Cellubrevin levels also appeared to increase gradually until adult values were attained by the end of the second postnatal week. The threefold increase of Synaptosomal-associated protein of 25 kDa(SNAP-25) mRNA shortly after birth compared to the low adult levels suggests that during this period Synaptosomal-associated protein of 25 kDa(SNAP-25) is implicated in additional functions than regulated secretion, possibly associated with cellular growth or maturation.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Effects of intraocular tetrodotoxin on the development of the retinocollicular pathway in the Syrian hamster.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The developing uncrossed retinocollicular projection in the Syrian hamster undergoes a characteristic set of changes during the first 2 postnatal weeks. The <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> fibres, which initially project across the whole <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion>, withdraw from the caudal part and their terminals become clustered into deep, discrete clumps rostrally. Coincident with these afferent changes, there is substantial <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> ganglion cell death. To examine whether neuronal activity plays a role in these changes, we made daily injections of the sodium channel blocker tetrodotoxin (TTX) into one or both eyes from postnatal day 2 or 4 up to day 12. Following tetrodotoxin(TTX) treatment, the uncrossed terminals retracted on schedule from the <BrainRegion>caudal and superficial parts of the superior colliculus</BrainRegion> and came to lie, as normal, in the deep layers rostrally. Within the <BrainRegion>rostral superior colliculus</BrainRegion>, however, the uncrossed terminals from tetrodotoxin(TTX) -injected eyes lost their characteristic patchy distribution and were arranged diffusely. When only one eye received tetrodotoxin(TTX) injections, this inhibiting effect on terminal segregation was seen only in the projections from the tetrodotoxin(TTX) -treated eye. The effect of tetrodotoxin(TTX) treatment on terminal segregation was much less severe than that of unilateral enucleation, after which uncrossed terminals persis throughout the entire <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion>. tetrodotoxin(TTX) injections appeared to have little effect on overall ganglion cell death since the total number of ganglion cells in the crossed projection from tetrodotoxin(TTX) -treated eyes was similar to that in normal eyes. However, the relative distribution of uncrossed cells in <BrainRegion>temporal and nasal retina</BrainRegion> was altered. In eyes that received tetrodotoxin(TTX) injections, the proportion of uncrossed cells in <BrainRegion>nasal retina</BrainRegion> was about 1.6 times that in normal animals and was close to the proportion seen in unilaterally enucleated animals. This increase in the treated eye occurred whether one or both eyes were injected with tetrodotoxin(TTX) . We conclude that neuronal activity plays a role in the segregation of uncrossed terminals into discrete clumps in <BrainRegion>rostral colliculus</BrainRegion> and in the preferential elimination of uncrossed cells from the <BrainRegion>nasal retina</BrainRegion>. The inactive uncrossed projections from tetrodotoxin(TTX) -treated eyes showed the greatest degree of disruption. The extent of the disruption was similar whether the crossed input from the other eye was active or inactive. This suggests that the activity-drive interactions between ganglion cells within one eye are more significant than those between the two eyes in shaping the final form of the uncrossed retinocollicular projection.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Time course of mossy fiber degeneration following <BrainRegion>pontine</BrainRegion> ablation in the rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The normal ultrastructure of mossy fiber terminals within the <BrainRegion>ansiform lobule</BrainRegion> of the rat was investigated in parasagittal sections of the <BrainRegion>cerebellar cortex</BrainRegion>. Four types of mossy fiber varicosities (simple and complex dispersed, simple and complex clustered) were distinguished on the basis of the presence or absence of clublike excrescences and the concentration of synaptic vesicles within the <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> zone of the terminal. Removal of the <BrainRegion>pontocerebellar</BrainRegion> input to the <BrainRegion>contralateral cerebellar hemisphere</BrainRegion> was performed electrolytically. Such lesions, when placed in the <BrainRegion>basilar pontine gray</BrainRegion> using a dorsal approach, resulted in the degeneration of nearly the entire population of mossy fiber varicosities within the <BrainRegion>contralateral ansiform lobule</BrainRegion>. As early as 3 days following <BrainRegion>pontine</BrainRegion> ablation, degenerative changes were observed within the synaptic portions of the mossy fibers. Two distinct axonal reactions were apparent within this population of degenerating varicosities. A small population of mossy fiber varicosities (12%) of the simple clustered variety underwent a rapid course of electron-dense degeneration, which was complete by the fifth day. These mossy fiber varicosities were very susceptible to phagocytosis by reactive glial elements. The second group which consisted of simple (60%) and complex (26%) varieties of dispersed terminals, underwent a very slow course of electron-dense degeneration. Reactive glial cells were rarely found in association with this second group of degenerating varicosities. As a result, most glomeruli were found to contain debris from degenerating mossy fiber varicosities throughout the first 57 days following pontine lesions. The majority of the <BrainRegion>cerebellar</BrainRegion> glomeruli, however, were denervated by 80 days.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Relationship between morphoelectrotonic properties of motoneuron dendrites and their trajectory.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The distribution and geometry of the dendritic trees of spinal motoneurons obey several well-established rules. Some of these rules are based on systematic relationships between quantitative geometrical features (e.g., total dendritic length) and the three-dimensional trajectory followed by dendrites from their origin to their termination. Because dendritic geometry partially determines the transmission of current and voltage signals generated by synapses on the dendritic tree, our goal was to compare the efficacy of signal transmission by dendritic trajectories that followed different directions. To achieve this goal, we constructed detailed compartmental models of the dendritic trees of three intracellularly stained biventer cervicis/complexus (BCCM) motoneurons and calculated the electronic properties of 361 dendritic paths. Each trajectory was classified according to its orientation, e.g., rostral, rostral-dorsal-lateral. The attenuation of current and voltage signals en route to the soma was strongly related to trajectory orientation. Trajectories with similar attenuation factors formed functional subunits that were arranged in distinct domains within the ventral horn. Changes in R(m) or R(i) had little effect on which trajectories belonged to each functional subunit. However, differences in the efficacy of signal transmission between subunits increased during high network activity (mimicked by decreases in R(m)). The most efficient subunit delivered two times more current and four times more voltage to the soma than the least efficient subunit. These results indicate that the input-output properties of motoneurons depend on the direction of the path taken by dendrites from their origin at the cell body to their terminals.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Evidence for a glutamatergic projection from the <BrainRegion>zona incerta</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>basal ganglia</BrainRegion> of rats.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>This study explores the organisation and neurochemical nature of the projections from the <BrainRegion>zona incerta</BrainRegion> (ZI) to the <BrainRegion>basal ganglia</BrainRegion>. Sprague-Dawley rats were anaesthetised with ketamine (100 mg/kg) and Rompun (10 mg/kg), and injections of cholera toxin subunit B were made into each of the following nuclei: the <BrainRegion>zona incerta</BrainRegion>(ZI) , the <BrainRegion>substantia nigra</BrainRegion> (SN), the <BrainRegion>pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus</BrainRegion> (PpT), and the <BrainRegion>entopeduncular nucleus</BrainRegion> (Ep). Brains were aldehyde fixed, sectioned, and processed using standard methods. Tracer-labelled sections were then doubly labelled with antibodies to glutamate (Glu), nitric oxide synthase (NOS), parvalbumin (Pv), or glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD; the latter two are markers for GABAergic cells); these neurochemicals characterise most types of <BrainRegion>zona incerta</BrainRegion>(ZI) cells. After <BrainRegion>zona incerta</BrainRegion>(ZI) injections, labelling was nonuniform across the different <BrainRegion>basal ganglia nuclei</BrainRegion>. The bulk of labelling, both anterograde and retrograde, was seen in the <BrainRegion>substantia nigra</BrainRegion>(SN) and <BrainRegion>pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus</BrainRegion>(PpT) and, to a lesser extent, within the other <BrainRegion>nuclei of the basal ganglia</BrainRegion> (e.g., <BrainRegion>caudate-putamen</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>globus pallidus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>subthalamus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>entopeduncular nucleus</BrainRegion>(Ep) ). In the <BrainRegion>substantia nigra</BrainRegion>(SN) , labelling was found in both major parts of the nucleus, the <BrainRegion>pars compacta</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>pars reticulata</BrainRegion>. Within the <BrainRegion>pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus</BrainRegion>(PpT) , however, the bulk of labelling was limited to only one of the two sectors of the nucleus, namely, the <BrainRegion>pars dissipata ( pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus</BrainRegion>(PpT) d). The <BrainRegion>pars compacta of the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus</BrainRegion>(PpT) ( <BrainRegion>pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus</BrainRegion>(PpT) c) remained largely free of labelled profiles. After CTb injections into three <BrainRegion>basal ganglia nuclei</BrainRegion> ( <BrainRegion>substantia nigra</BrainRegion>(SN) , <BrainRegion>pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus</BrainRegion>(PpT) , <BrainRegion>entopeduncular nucleus</BrainRegion>(Ep) ), most labelled cells in the <BrainRegion>zona incerta</BrainRegion>(ZI) were glutamate+ and very few were nitric oxide synthase(NOS) + or gamma-aminobutyric acidergic. Overall, the results indicate that the <BrainRegion>zona incerta</BrainRegion>(ZI) is in a position to influence preferentially the activity of the <BrainRegion>substantia nigra</BrainRegion>(SN) and <BrainRegion>pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus</BrainRegion>(PpT) d of the <BrainRegion>basal ganglia</BrainRegion> via an excitatory, glutamatergic input.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Morphology and projection pattern of <BrainRegion>medial and dorsal pallial</BrainRegion> neurons in the frog Discoglossus pictus and the salamander Plethodon jordani.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>In the frog Discoglossus pictus and the salamander Plethodon jordani, the morphology and axonal projection pattern of neurons in the <BrainRegion>medial and dorsal pallium</BrainRegion> were determined by intracellular biocytin labeling. A total of 77 <BrainRegion>pallial</BrainRegion> neurons were labeled in the frog and 58 <BrainRegion>pallial</BrainRegion> neurons in the salamander. Within the <BrainRegion>medial pallium</BrainRegion> (MP) of the frog, four types of neurons were identified on the basis of differences in their axonal projection pattern. Type I neurons have bilateral projections into <BrainRegion>telencephalic</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>diencephalic areas</BrainRegion>; type II neurons have bilateral projections to <BrainRegion>telencephalic areas</BrainRegion> and ipsilaterally descending projections to <BrainRegion>diencephalic regions</BrainRegion>; type III neurons have only <BrainRegion>intratelencephalic</BrainRegion> connections, and a single type IV neuron has ipsilaterally descending projections. The somata of the four types occupy four nonoverlapping zones. Neurons of the <BrainRegion>dorsal pallium</BrainRegion> (DP) project exclusively to the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral medial pallium</BrainRegion>(MP) and to the <BrainRegion>dorsal edge of the lateral pallium</BrainRegion>. In the <BrainRegion>ventral medial pallium</BrainRegion>(MP) of the salamander, neurons have mostly <BrainRegion>intratelencephalic</BrainRegion> projections. Neurons in the <BrainRegion>dorsal medial pallium</BrainRegion>(MP) project bilaterally to <BrainRegion>diencephalic</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>telencephalic regions</BrainRegion>. Neurons in the <BrainRegion>medial dorsal pallium</BrainRegion>(DP) project ipsilaterally to the <BrainRegion>medial pallium</BrainRegion>(MP) , <BrainRegion>lateral septum</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>nucleus accumbens</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>medial amygdala</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>internal granule layer of the olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>. In five cases, fibers were found in the <BrainRegion>commissura hippocampi</BrainRegion>, but in only two cases could these fibers be followed toward the <BrainRegion>contralateral medial pallium</BrainRegion>(MP) and <BrainRegion>septum</BrainRegion>. Neurons in the <BrainRegion>lateral dorsal pallium</BrainRegion>(DP) had no contralateral projections; they projected to the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral medial pallium</BrainRegion>(MP) and in eight cases to the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral septum</BrainRegion> as well. Based on similarities of cytoarchitecture and projection pattern in neurons of the <BrainRegion>medial pallium</BrainRegion>(MP) and <BrainRegion>dorsal pallium</BrainRegion>(DP) , it is proposed that both frogs and salamanders have an <BrainRegion>medial pallium</BrainRegion>(MP) subdivided into a ventral and dorsal portion, and a <BrainRegion>dorsal pallium</BrainRegion>(DP) subdivided into a medial and a lateral portion.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Galanin immunoreactivity in the primate central nervous system.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Galanin-immunoreactive profiles were localized within the monkey and human central nervous system. In the monkey <BrainRegion>telencephalon</BrainRegion>, galanin-immunoreactive perikarya were seen within the <BrainRegion>anterior olfactory nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>basal forebrain</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>endopiriform nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>bed nucleus of the stria terminalis</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>caudate nucleus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>putamen</BrainRegion> contained galanin-immunoreactive perikarya whereas the <BrainRegion>nucleus accumbens</BrainRegion> displayed only galanin-immunoreactive fibers. In the <BrainRegion>diencephalon</BrainRegion>, galanin-immunoreactive profiles were seen within the <BrainRegion>medial preoptic area</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>periventricular</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>paraventricular</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>arcuate nuclei</BrainRegion> as well as the <BrainRegion>lateral hypothalamic area</BrainRegion>. Within the <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion>, only galanin-immunoreactive fibers were seen within the <BrainRegion>midline paraventricular</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>reuniens</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>rhomboid nuclei</BrainRegion>. In the <BrainRegion>mesencephalon</BrainRegion>, scattered galanin-immunoreactive fibers were seen in the <BrainRegion>periaquaductal gray</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>ventral tegmental area</BrainRegion>, and midbrain <BrainRegion>reticular formation</BrainRegion>. In the <BrainRegion>metencephalon</BrainRegion>, galanin-immunoreactive neurons were observed in the <BrainRegion>medial vestibular nucleus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>nucleus prepositus</BrainRegion>. In the <BrainRegion>myelencephalon</BrainRegion>, galanin-immunoreactive perikarya were seen within the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the tractus solitarius</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>hypoglossal nucleus</BrainRegion>. Dense collections of galanin-immunoreactive fibers were found in the <BrainRegion>spinal</BrainRegion> descending tract of V, <BrainRegion>nucleus of the tractus solitarius</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>dorsal motor nucleus of X</BrainRegion>. Galanin immunoreactivity was also observed within all <BrainRegion>circumventricular organs</BrainRegion>. <BrainRegion>Spinal anterior horn</BrainRegion> neurons expressed galanin immunoreactivity, and immunopositive fibers were seen within the tract of Lissauer and the <BrainRegion>substantia gelatinosa</BrainRegion>. Although the distribution of galanin immunoreactivity was generally similar between monkeys and humans, there were a few striking exceptions. The human <BrainRegion>supraoptic nucleus</BrainRegion> contained galanin-immunoreactive neurons, whereas the monkey <BrainRegion>supraoptic nucleus</BrainRegion> displayed only immunopositive fibers. Similarly, galanin-immunoreactive perikarya and fibers were seen in the human <BrainRegion>locus coeruleus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>subcoeruleus</BrainRegion>, whereas in monkeys these regions contained only fibers. These data demonstrate a widespread distribution of galanin-containing profiles in primates, suggesting that galanin may modulate cognitive, sensory, motor, and autonomic processes.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Direct projections from the <BrainRegion>ventrolateral medulla oblongata</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>limbic forebrain</BrainRegion>: anterograde and retrograde tract-tracing studies in the rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Neurons in the <BrainRegion>ventrolateral medulla oblongata</BrainRegion>, a brain region implicated in central vasomotor regulation, have previously been reported to project to some <BrainRegion>forebrain limbic structures</BrainRegion>. The aim of the present study was (1) to describe the termination pattern of <BrainRegion>ventral medullary</BrainRegion> afferents in <BrainRegion>forebrain limbic areas</BrainRegion> using anterograde tract tracing, and (2) to determine the location and some morphological characteristics of the projection neurons using retrograde tract tracing from selected <BrainRegion>forebrain</BrainRegion> sites. Following ionophoretic microinjections of the anterograde tract tracer Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin into the <BrainRegion>rostral ventrolateral medulla</BrainRegion>, labelled afferents were observed in the <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>entorhinal and retrosplenial cortices</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>dorsal septum</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>nucleus accumbens</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>medial prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion>. Anterogradely labelled axons, ascending from the <BrainRegion>caudal ventrolateral medulla</BrainRegion>, could be traced only to the rostral aspects of the investigated <BrainRegion>forebrain limbic structures</BrainRegion>. Here, the main target of the ascending projection was in the <BrainRegion>ventral septum</BrainRegion>. However, labelled terminals were also present in the <BrainRegion>nucleus accumbens</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>dorsolateral septum</BrainRegion>, and in the <BrainRegion>infralimbic cortex</BrainRegion>. The density of the <BrainRegion>ventrolateral medullary</BrainRegion> projections into all examined <BrainRegion>forebrain areas</BrainRegion> was low. The location of the cells in the <BrainRegion>ventral medulla oblongata</BrainRegion> which give rise to direct <BrainRegion>forebrain</BrainRegion> projections was examined using retrograde tract tracing with wheat germ agglutinin conjugated horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP). Following wheat germ agglutinin conjugated horseradish peroxidase(WGA-HRP) injections into the <BrainRegion>septo-accumbens region</BrainRegion>, retrogradely labelled cells were present in both the <BrainRegion>rostral and caudal ventrolateral medulla</BrainRegion>. When the tract tracer injection was restricted to the <BrainRegion>ventral region of the septal complex</BrainRegion>, the labelled cells were concentrated in the <BrainRegion>caudal aspects of the ventrolateral medulla</BrainRegion> (and the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion>). Following tracer injections into the <BrainRegion>anterior cingulate cortex</BrainRegion> or the <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion> or the <BrainRegion>entorhinal cortex</BrainRegion>, retrogradely labelled cells in the <BrainRegion>medulla oblongata</BrainRegion> were predominantly in the <BrainRegion>rostral ventrolateral medulla</BrainRegion>. As a first attempt to reveal the chemical nature of the projection cells, the contribution of tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive cells to the innervation of the <BrainRegion>septo-accumbens area</BrainRegion> was also investigated: tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive cells of both the <BrainRegion>caudal ventrolateral medulla</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion> were found to contribute to the innervation of the <BrainRegion>septo-accumbens area</BrainRegion>. The distribution of retrogradely labelled cells as well as the termination pattern of the anterogradely labelled terminals indicated that the innervation of the various <BrainRegion>forebrain limbic areas</BrainRegion> arises from cells, diffusely distributed in the rostral and/or the caudal <BrainRegion>ventrolateral medulla oblongata</BrainRegion>.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Neuronal overload in the developing anuran <BrainRegion>lateral motor column</BrainRegion> in response to limb removal and thyroid hormone.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The <BrainRegion>lateral motor column</BrainRegion> (LMC) in the anuran <BrainRegion>spinal cord n</BrainRegion>ormally undergoes a dramatic reduction in motor neuron number during development. At least two factors influence this process: the limb target which is required for the progression of cell loss, and thyroid hormone, a requisite for metamorphosis. This study has examined the relative and combined effects of limb amputation and exogenous thyroxine, initiated at the onset of normal rapid cell loss in Rana pipiens tadpoles, in regulating neuron number in the <BrainRegion>lumbosacral lateral motor column</BrainRegion>(LMC) . Thyroxine treatment or unilateral limb amputation temporarily resulted in significantly more <BrainRegion>lateral motor column</BrainRegion>(LMC) neurons than in untreated controls. Extraordinary numbers of motor neurons persisted through metamorphic climax when both treatments were combined. Population sizes frequently exceeded the maximum number of neurons observed prior to the onset of natural cell loss. Moreover, thyroxine-treated tadpoles contained increased numbers of mitotic figures in the <BrainRegion>ventricular zone of the spinal cord</BrainRegion> and significantly more newly generated cells in the <BrainRegion>lateral motor column</BrainRegion>(LMC) , as revealed by 3H-thymidine autoradiography. These findings suggest that thyroxine-potentiated mitogenesis promotes greater numbers of new motor neurons to the <BrainRegion>lateral motor column</BrainRegion>(LMC) while, simultaneously, target removal delays the loss of extant cells. It is proposed that this interaction effectively maintains an immature state in the <BrainRegion>lateral motor column</BrainRegion>(LMC) so that neuronal &quot;decisions" for survival and the consequent loss of target-deprived neurons are postponed far longer than previously reported.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Successive waves of differentiation of cutaneous afferents in rat mystacial skin.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The present study has traced the sequence of maturation of sensory receptors in the mystacial pad of postnatal rats. At birth the follicle-sinus complexes (F-SC) are well innervated by <BrainRegion>deep vibrissal nerves</BrainRegion> although the number of axons entering the sinus is less than that in the adult. The innervation of the <BrainRegion>follicle-sinus complexes</BrainRegion>(F-SC) by the conus or superficial <BrainRegion>vibrissal nerves</BrainRegion> derived from skin nerves that form the superficial dermal nerve plexus is limited to the Merkel rete ridge collar at birth, and the innervation to the <BrainRegion>inner conical body</BrainRegion> is conspicuously absent. The <BrainRegion>inner conical body</BrainRegion> innervation begins to appear 3-4 days after birth and rapidly matures over the week. By 3 weeks of age the <BrainRegion>follicle-sinus complexes</BrainRegion>(F-SC) s have a mature sensory innervation. At birth small guard hairs are present in the intervibrissal pelage and are associated with scant axons of the superficial dermal nerve plexus, but no mature sensory terminals are present. The sensory innervation of the intervening pelage begins to differentiate during the second week and mature piloneural complexes can be recognized by 3 weeks of age. Innervation to vellus hairs is still developing at 3-4 weeks of age. These maturational changes in peripheral sensory innervation correlate with gradual changes in the structure of barrels in the <BrainRegion>first somatosensory cortex</BrainRegion> (SI). Sequential waves of differentiation of sensory receptors appear to be a general feature of neural development.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Nigrothalamic</BrainRegion> projections in the monkey demonstrated by autoradiographic technics.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>In spite of repeated demonstrations by degeneration technics, <BrainRegion>nigrothalamic</BrainRegion> fibers have been regarded with some skepticism. Attempts were made to trace <BrainRegion>nigral</BrainRegion> efferent projections in the monkey by autoradiographic technics. Tritiated amino acids (L-leucine, L-lysine and L-proline), injected into portions of the <BrainRegion>substantia nigra</BrainRegion> (SN), labeled cells in four regions, designated as, (1) rostrolateral, (2) caudolateral, (3) rostromedial and (4) central. <BrainRegion>Rostrolateral nigral</BrainRegion> neurons transported radioactive label preferentially and abundantly to <BrainRegion>thalamic nuclei</BrainRegion>; localized isotope was found in parts of three <BrainRegion>thalamic nuclei</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>medial part of the ventral lateral nucleus</BrainRegion> (VLm), the <BrainRegion>magnocellular part of the ventral anterior nucleus</BrainRegion> (VAmc), and the <BrainRegion>paralaminar part of the dorsomedial nucleus</BrainRegion> (DMpl)9 Lateral neurons in the <BrainRegion>caudal half of the substantia nigra</BrainRegion>(SN) transmitted radioactive label to the same <BrainRegion>thalamic nuclei</BrainRegion> as <BrainRegion>rostrolateral nigral</BrainRegion> neuron. Isotope transported to portions of the <BrainRegion>striatum</BrainRegion> was modest and localized. Radioactive label taken up by large cells in the <BrainRegion>caudal third of the substantia nigra</BrainRegion>(SN) was transported to portions of the <BrainRegion>striatum</BrainRegion>, but not to <BrainRegion>thalamic nuclei</BrainRegion>. Labeled <BrainRegion>nigral</BrainRegion> neurons in the <BrainRegion>medial two-thirds of the rostral half of the substantia nigra</BrainRegion>(SN) , and in the <BrainRegion>middle third of the central part of the substantia nigra</BrainRegion>(SN) , transported the label mainly to parts of the <BrainRegion>caudate nucleus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>putamen</BrainRegion>. In these animals modest radioactive label was seen in <BrainRegion>VLm</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>VAmc</BrainRegion>, but not in other <BrainRegion>thalamic nuclei</BrainRegion>. There was no evidence that <BrainRegion>nigral</BrainRegion> neurons project to the <BrainRegion>subthalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>. No radioactive transport from <BrainRegion>nigral</BrainRegion> neurons was detected in the <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion>, the midbrain <BrainRegion>tegmentum</BrainRegion>, or the <BrainRegion>red nucleus</BrainRegion>, and none was transported to more <BrainRegion>caudal brain stem nuclei</BrainRegion>. <BrainRegion>Nigrothalamic</BrainRegion> fibers arise particularly from cells in <BrainRegion>rostral and lateral parts of the substantia nigra</BrainRegion>. While some cells in other parts of the <BrainRegion>nigra</BrainRegion> project to <BrainRegion>thalamic nuclei</BrainRegion>, these appear scattered and less numerous. Large cells in <BrainRegion>caudal parts of the substantia nigra</BrainRegion>(SN) do not project to <BrainRegion>thalamic nuclei</BrainRegion>. These observations confirm <BrainRegion>nigrothalamic</BrainRegion> projections to <BrainRegion>VLm</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>VAmc</BrainRegion>, and identify a new <BrainRegion>nigral</BrainRegion> projection to part of the <BrainRegion>dorsomedial nucleus of the thalamus</BrainRegion> (DMpl). No <BrainRegion>nigral</BrainRegion> efferent fibers project to any of the <BrainRegion>intralaminar thalamic nuclei</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Laminar and columnar patterns of geniculocortical projections in the cat: relationship to cytochrome oxidase.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>We examined the laminar and columnar arrangement of projections from different layers of the <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion> (LGN) to the <BrainRegion>visual cortex</BrainRegion> in the cat. In light of recent reports that cytochrome oxidase blobs (which in primates receive specific <BrainRegion>geniculate</BrainRegion> inputs) are also found in the <BrainRegion>visual cortex</BrainRegion> of cats, the relationship between cytochrome oxidase staining and <BrainRegion>geniculate</BrainRegion> inputs in this species was studied. Injections of wheat germ agglutinin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase were made into the anterior &quot;genu" of the <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(LGN) , where isoelevation contours of the <BrainRegion>geniculate</BrainRegion> layers are distorted due to the curvature of the nucleus. Consequently, anterograde labeling from the various <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(LGN) layers was topographically separated across the surface of the <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion>, and labeling in a particular isoelevation representation of the <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion> could be associated with a specific layer of the <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(LGN) . Labeling from the A layers, which contain X and Y cells, was coextensive with layers 4 and 6 in both <BrainRegion>area 17</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>area 18</BrainRegion>, as previously reported. Labeling from the C layers, which contain Y and W cells, occupied a zone extending from the 4a/4b border to part way into layer 3 in <BrainRegion>area 17</BrainRegion>. The labeling extended throughout layer 4 in <BrainRegion>area 18</BrainRegion>. There was also labeling in layer 5a and layer 1 in both <BrainRegion>area 17</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>area 18</BrainRegion>. Except in layer 1, labeling from the C layers was patchy. In the tangential plane, adjacent sections stained for cytochrome oxidase showed that the patches of labeling from the C laminae aligned with the cytochrome oxidase blobs. The cytochrome blobs were visible in layers 3 and 4a, but not in layer 4b in both <BrainRegion>areas 17 and 18</BrainRegion>. These results suggest that W cells project specifically to the layer 3 portion of the blobs, while Y cells, at least those of the C layers, project specifically to the layer 4a portion of the blobs in <BrainRegion>area 17</BrainRegion>. The heavy synaptic drive of the Y cells is probably the cause of the elevated metabolism, and thus, higher cytochrome oxidase activity, of the blobs.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Developmental patterning of rod and cone photoreceptors in embryonic zebrafish.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Cone photoreceptors in the zebrafish <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> are arranged in a crystalline lattice, with each spectral subtype at a specific position in the array; rod photoreceptors are inserted around the cones. Patterning events and developmental mechanisms that lead to the formation of the cone mosaic are not known. To begin investigating this issue, we examined the initial stages of opsin expression in zebrafish embryos by in situ hybridization with goldfish opsin cRNA probes to determine how and when the cone mosaic pattern arises. We found both differences and similarities in the spatiotemporal patterns of rod and cone development, which suggest the following: 1) Expression of opsin message (including rod opsin, blue and red cone opsins) was found in a ventral patch of <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> located nasal to the <BrainRegion>choroid fissure</BrainRegion>. 2) The cone mosaic pattern was generated by a crystallization-like process initiated in the precocial ventral patch and secondarily in <BrainRegion>nasal retina</BrainRegion>, which then swept like a wave into <BrainRegion>dorsotemporal retina</BrainRegion>. 3) The remainder of the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>, suggesting that these precocial rods might differ from typical rods. 4) Developmental maturation of rods in zebrafish, as reflected by expression of opsin, may be accelerated compared to cones, which are thought to become postmitotic before rods. These data are consistent with a model in which lateral inductive interactions among differentiating photoreceptors lead to patterning of the array.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Anuran accessory optic system: evidence for a dual organization.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The accessory optic system of Rana pipiens consists of <BrainRegion>lateral and medial fascicles of the basal optic root</BrainRegion> (BOR1, BORm) and a single terminal nucleus, <BrainRegion>nBOR</BrainRegion>. The present study provides new evidence that these two fascicles differ not only in their trajectories but in fiber spectra and innervation patterns as well. <BrainRegion>BOR1</BrainRegion> contains a substantially higher percentage of large, myelinated axons than does <BrainRegion>BORm</BrainRegion>, and the mean diameter of axons in <BrainRegion>BOR1</BrainRegion> is greater than that of <BrainRegion>BORm</BrainRegion>. <BrainRegion>BOR1</BrainRegion> innervates the entire terminal field of <BrainRegion>nBOR</BrainRegion>, while <BrainRegion>BORm</BrainRegion> innervates only the <BrainRegion>central and mediodorsal portions of nBOR</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>ventrolateral portion of nBOR</BrainRegion> is uniquely innervated by <BrainRegion>BOR1</BrainRegion> and contains several types of neurons not found in the <BrainRegion>central and medial regions of nBOR</BrainRegion> which are innervated by both fascicles. Cytoarchitectural analysis of <BrainRegion>nBOR</BrainRegion> with Golgi techniques has revealed a number of similarities between the anuran <BrainRegion>nBOR</BrainRegion> and the mammalian <BrainRegion>medial terminal nucleus</BrainRegion> (MTN) with regard to cellular morphology, dendritic geometry, and retinofugal arborization patterns. In frog, <BrainRegion>nBOR</BrainRegion> appears comparable to the ventral subdivision of the mammalian <BrainRegion>medial terminal nucleus</BrainRegion>(MTN) , while the <BrainRegion>peri-nBOR region</BrainRegion>, which contains neurons postsynaptic to <BrainRegion>nBOR</BrainRegion>, may represent a more primordial version of the mammalian <BrainRegion>dorsal medial terminal nucleus</BrainRegion>(MTN) .</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Paucity of presumptive ruffini corpuscles in the index finger pad of humans.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Classically recognized as the cutaneous stretch receptors associated with the slowly adapting type II (SAII) primary afferents, Ruffini corpuscles have rarely been reported in the skin, despite numerous histologic investigations. Electrophysiological recordings of the primary afferents in humans suggest that slowly adapting type II(SAII) fibers represent approximately 15% of the myelinated mechanosensitive axons in the peripheral nerves innervating the volar surface of the hand. In the present study, an analysis of glabrous skin was conducted in human donors to assess the distribution of Ruffini and Ruffini-like corpuscles in the distal phalanx of the index finger. Only one presumptive Ruffini corpuscle was found in the skin processed for double immunofluorescence labeling with antibodies against protein gene product 9.5 and neurofilament 200-kDa subunit. Based on their relatively scattered distributions, we conclude that very few slowly adapting type II(SAII) primary afferents are likely to terminate as Ruffini corpuscles in human glabrous skin.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Immunological localization of Tritonia peptide in the central and peripheral nervous system of the terrestrial snail Helix aspersa.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>We report here evidence that the pedal peptides (Peps) first discovered in mollusks may be neurotransmitters with a general role in control of molluscan somatic and visceral muscles. Using Tritonia peptide (TPep) antiserum we obtained morphological evidence for such a role in Helix aspersa. We localized 1,200-1,400 small and medium-sized (5-40 microm) Tritonia peptide(TPep) -IR neurons in the central nervous system of Helix and demonstrated the presence of these neurons in each ganglion. Many Tritonia peptide(TPep) -immunoreactive ( TPep-immunoreactive(IR) ) neurons were motoneurons that sent axons to almost all peripheral nerves. Tritonia peptide(TPep) - TPep-immunoreactive(IR) fibers innervated the foot, esophagus, hermaphroditic duct, optic tentacles, salivary gland, heart, and proximal and distal aorta. In peripheral tissues Tritonia peptide(TPep) - TPep-immunoreactive(IR) fiber ramifications were mostly associated with muscles and with ciliated epithelia. In addition, Tritonia peptide(TPep) - TPep-immunoreactive(IR) fibers were in the neuropil of the ganglia, the commissures, and the connectives, and they formed axosomatic terminals in the central nervous system. Tritonia peptide(TPep) - TPep-immunoreactive(IR) neurons were found in the esophagus and hermaphroditic duct and as sensory receptors in the bulb of the optic tentacles. These results from Helix, and those reported elsewhere from other mollusks, suggest a general involvement of Tritonia peptide(TPep) -like substances in control of muscle- and ciliary-driven motor activities, including perhaps their antecedent sensory and central axosomatic integrative activity.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Comparative study of aging in the mouse <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Gene knockout technologies have been used to elevate the mouse as a model species. However, little work has examined age and strain differences in the mouse olfactory system. The present study compared the <BrainRegion>olfactory bulbs</BrainRegion> of mature (6 month) and aged (24 month) males of BALB/cBy, C57BL/6J, and DBA/2 strains. Volumes of the glomerular (GLM), external plexiform (EPL), and mitral/granule cell (MIG) layers varied little from strain to strain. Volume measurements increased with age even when corrected for body weight differences. Two nonoverlapping interneuron populations were examined with immunohistochemistry. Staining for the calcium binding protein calretinin varied little between strains, but age-related increases in staining were seen in external plexiform(EPL) of C57BL/6J mice. Typical patterns of tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity were observed in all subjects except for old DBA/2 mice, which evidenced considerable staining in submitral areas. Age-related increases were observed in BALB/cBy and DBA/2 mice but not in the C57BL/6J strain. Glial fibrillary acidic protein staining was similar in old BALB/cBy and DBA/2 mice, with astrocytes in all layers of the bulb, but more concentrated in the mitral/granule cell(MIG) . However, C57BL/6J tissue revealed very large astrocytes relatively evenly distributed in all layers. Cell proliferation dropped dramatically with age. Labeled cells could still be observed along the <BrainRegion>lateral ventricles</BrainRegion>, but very few were observed within the rostral migratory stream or <BrainRegion>subventricular zone</BrainRegion>. Although TUNEL labeling revealed many apoptotic figures in the granule cell layer of young subjects, almost no staining was seen in aged mice.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Cortical</BrainRegion> influences on sizes and rapid plasticity of tactile receptive fields in the <BrainRegion>dorsal column nuclei</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The <BrainRegion>cerebral cortex</BrainRegion> influences <BrainRegion>subcortical</BrainRegion> processing. In the somatosensory system, descending <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> inputs contribute in specific ways to the sizes and plasticity of tactile receptive fields (RFs) in the <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion>, but less is known about <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> influences on these aspects of <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion> receptive fields(RFs) . The present studies evaluated how loss of <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> inputs affects sizes and plasticity of receptive fields(RFs) in the <BrainRegion>brainstem dorsal column nuclei</BrainRegion> (DCN) when peripheral inputs were normal and when peripheral inputs were acutely disrupted. Loss of <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> inputs was produced by acute lesion of <BrainRegion>somatosensory, motor, and adjacent cortex</BrainRegion>, whereas disruption of peripheral inputs was produced by cutaneous microinjection of lidocaine (LID). Modest or no changes in sizes of <BrainRegion>dorsal column nuclei</BrainRegion>(DCN) receptive fields(RFs) , comparable to changes during control periods of no treatment, were seen in response to <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> lesion. lidocaine(LID) caused rapid enlargements in receptive fields(RFs) when <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion> was intact. lidocaine(LID) also caused rapid RF enlargements after <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> lesion, and these enlargements were greater than post- lidocaine(LID) enlargements when <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion> was intact. These results indicate that normally sized receptive fields(RFs) continue to be produced in the <BrainRegion>dorsal column nuclei</BrainRegion>(DCN) after loss of <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> input. <BrainRegion>Cortex</BrainRegion> is also not required for RF enlargements after lidocaine(LID) ; however, <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> inputs have a constraining effect on these enlargements. Considered with findings from previous <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> studies, these results suggest that <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> influences on RF size and plasticity in the <BrainRegion>dorsal column nuclei</BrainRegion>(DCN) and <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion> differ in some respects.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Glutamate receptor subunits at mossy fiber-unipolar brush cell synapses: light and electron microscopic immunocytochemical study in <BrainRegion>cerebellar cortex</BrainRegion> of rat and cat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The present study provides a survey of the immunolocalization of ionotropic glutamate receptor subunits throughout the rat and cat <BrainRegion>cerebellar cortex</BrainRegion>, with emphasis on the unipolar brush cell (UBC), a hitherto neglected <BrainRegion>cerebellar</BrainRegion> cell that is densely concentrated in the granular layer of the <BrainRegion>vestibulocerebellum</BrainRegion> and that forms giant synapses with mossy fibers. An array of nine previously characterized antibodies has been used, each of which stained a characteristic profile of <BrainRegion>cerebellar</BrainRegion> cells. The unipolar brush cell(UBC) s of both rat and cat were strongly immunostained by an antibody against the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazoleproprionate (AMPA) receptor subunits, GluR2 and GluR3; were moderately immunostained by a monoclonal antibody to kainate receptor subunits, GluR5/6/7; were weakly immunostained by antibodies to NR1 subunits; and were not stained by antibodies to GluR1, GluR4, GluR6/7, KA-2, and NR2A/B. Postsynaptic densities of the giant mossy fiber- unipolar brush cell(UBC) synapses were GluR2/3, GluR5/6/7, and NR1 immunoreactive. The other <BrainRegion>cerebellar</BrainRegion> neurons were all immunolabeled to some extent with the GluR2/3 and NR1 antibodies. In addition, Purkinje cells were immunopositive for GluR1 and GluR5/6/7; granule cells were immunopositive for GluR5/6/7, GluR6/7, KA-2, and NR2A/B. The Golgi-Bergmann glia was densely stained by GluR1 and GluR4 antibodies, whereas astrocytes of the granular layer were stained by the GluR4 antiserum. Data provided herein may guide further electrophysiological and pharmacological studies of <BrainRegion>cerebellar</BrainRegion> cells in general and the unipolar brush cell(UBC) s in particular.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Independent effects of incubation temperature and gonadal sex on the volume and metabolic capacity of brain nuclei in the leopard gecko (Eublepharis macularius), a lizard with temperature-dependent sex determination.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The extent to which variation within and between the sexes can be assigned to genes vs. environment is problematic, because, in most vertebrates, males and females differ genetically. However, factors other than sex chromosomes and the consequent sex-typical gonadal hormone secretions may play important roles in the differentiation of the neural mechanisms underlying individual and sex differences in aggressive and sexual behavior. The leopard gecko, like many oviparous reptiles, lacks sex chromosomes. Instead, gonadal sex is determined by temperature during embryogenesis, with low and high incubation temperatures producing females and intermediate temperatures producing mixed sex ratios. In essence, this allows for the study of individual and sex differences without the confounding variable of genetically determined gender. Experiments have shown that the temperature experienced during incubation plays a critical role in establishing the adult morphological, endocrinological, and behavioral phenotype. In this experiment, the independent effects of incubation temperature and gonadal sex on the morphology and metabolic capacity of specific brain nuclei were determined. Both individual and sex differences in the volume of the <BrainRegion>preoptic area</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus</BrainRegion> are determined primarily by incubation temperature, not by gonadal sex. However, incubation temperature and gonadal sex are both important in determining the metabolic capacity in the <BrainRegion>anterior hypothalamus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>external amygdala</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>dorsal lateral nucleus of the hypothalamus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>dorsal lateral nucleus of the thalamus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>dorsal ventricular ridge</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>habenula</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>lateral hypothalamus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>nucleus rotundus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>nucleus sphericus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>periventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>preoptic area</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>periventricular nucleus of the preoptic area</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>septum</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>striatum</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>torus semicircularis</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus</BrainRegion>. This is the first demonstration in a vertebrate that factors other than gonadal sex hormones, which arise from the individual&apos;s genetic constitution, can affect the sexual differentiation of the brain.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Prefrontal cortical</BrainRegion> efferents in the rat synapse on unlabeled neuronal targets of catecholamine terminals in the <BrainRegion>nucleus accumbens septi</BrainRegion> and on dopamine neurons in the <BrainRegion>ventral tegmental area</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Physiological and pharmacological studies indicate that descending projections from the <BrainRegion>prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion> modulate dopaminergic transmission in the <BrainRegion>nucleus accumbens septi</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>ventral tegmental area</BrainRegion>. We investigated the ultrastructural bases for these interactions in rat by examining the synaptic associations between <BrainRegion>prefrontal cortical</BrainRegion> terminals labeled with anterograde markers (lesion-induced degeneration or transport of Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin; PHA-L) and neuronal processes containing immunoreactivity for the catecholamine synthesizing enzyme, tyrosine hydroxylase. <BrainRegion>Prefrontal cortical</BrainRegion> terminals in the <BrainRegion>nucleus accumbens</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>ventral tegmental area</BrainRegion> contained clear, round vesicles and formed primarily asymmetric synapses on spines or small dendrites. In the <BrainRegion>ventral tegmental area</BrainRegion>, these terminals also formed asymmetric synapses on large dendrites and a few symmetric axodendritic synapses. In the <BrainRegion>nucleus accumbens septi</BrainRegion>, degenerating <BrainRegion>prefrontal cortical</BrainRegion> terminals synapsed on spiny dendrites which received convergent input from terminals containing peroxidase immunoreactivity for tyrosine hydroxylase, or from unlabeled terminals. In single sections, some tyrosine hydroxylase-labeled terminals formed thin and <BrainRegion>punctate</BrainRegion> symmetric synapses with dendritic shafts, or the heads and necks of spines. Close appositions, but not axo-axonic synapses, were frequently observed between degenerating <BrainRegion>prefrontal cortical</BrainRegion> afferents and tyrosine hydroxylase-labeled or unlabeled terminals. In the <BrainRegion>ventral tegmental area</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>prefrontal cortical</BrainRegion> terminals labeled with immunoperoxidase for PHA-L were in synaptic contact with dendrites containing immunogold reaction product for tyrosine hydroxylase, or with unlabeled dendrites. These results suggest that: (1) catecholaminergic (mainly dopaminergic) and <BrainRegion>prefrontal cortical</BrainRegion> terminals in the <BrainRegion>nucleus accumbens septi</BrainRegion> dually synapse on common spiny neurons; and (2) dopaminergic neurons in the <BrainRegion>ventral tegmental area</BrainRegion> receive monosynaptic input from <BrainRegion>prefrontal cortical</BrainRegion> afferents. This study provides the first ultrastructural basis for multiple sites of cellular interaction between <BrainRegion>prefrontal cortical</BrainRegion> efferents and <BrainRegion>mesolimbic</BrainRegion> dopaminergic neurons.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Localization of corticotropin-releasing factor-like immunoreactivity in monkey <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>secondary olfactory areas</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Electrophysiological and anatomical observations suggest that terminals of <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> mitral cells ending in rat <BrainRegion>primary olfactory cortex</BrainRegion> exert certain postsynaptic effects via an excitatory amino acid neurotransmitter. Recent anatomical studies have shown that several peptides, most notably corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) (Imaki et al., &apos;89) Brain Res., 496: 35-44), are also localized within rat <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> projection neurons, thus raising the possibility that there is a peptide cotransmitter in this system. In contrast to the availability of data for rodents, very little is known about the distribution of peptides and other putative transmitters in the olfactory systems of primate species. In the present study, sections through the <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> and its target areas were obtained from two monkey species (Saimiri sciureus and Macaca fascicularis) and processed for immunohistochemistry with a well-characterized polyclonal antiserum directed against the human form of corticotropin-releasing factor(CRF) . Virtually identical results were obtained in the two species. Within the <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>, nearly all mitral and many tufted cells contained corticotropin-releasing factor(CRF) -like immunoreactivity. corticotropin-releasing factor(CRF) -positive fibers were seen within the olfactory tract and <BrainRegion>olfactory stria</BrainRegion>, which contain the axons of mitral and tufted cells. Within the <BrainRegion>anterior olfactory nucleus</BrainRegion> and layer Ia of the <BrainRegion>olfactory tubercle</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>piriform cortex</BrainRegion>, immunoreactivity was seen within fine processes, as well as in coarse, varicose fibers and isolated puncta. corticotropin-releasing factor(CRF) -positive cells were seen within layer III of the <BrainRegion>olfactory tubercle</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>piriform cortex</BrainRegion>. Immunoreactive fibers and varicosities were also seen within olfactory-recipient regions of the <BrainRegion>amygdala</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>entorhinal cortex</BrainRegion>. These observations suggest that corticotropin-releasing factor(CRF) may act as a transmitter and/or neuromodulator in primate olfactory system.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>HRP study of the organization of <BrainRegion>auditory afferents</BrainRegion> ascending to <BrainRegion>central nucleus of inferior colliculus</BrainRegion> in cat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The ascending auditory projections to <BrainRegion>central nucleus of inferior colliculus</BrainRegion> and its ventrolateral and dorsomedial subdivisions (<BrainRegion>ICVL</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>ICDM</BrainRegion>) have been studied in cat using both pressure and electrophoretic injections of horseradish peroxidase (HRP). The results indicate that the predominant ascending projections to <BrainRegion>inferior colliculus</BrainRegion> originate in (1) <BrainRegion>contralateral cochlear nucleus</BrainRegion>, (2) <BrainRegion>contralateral and ipsilateral lateral superior olive</BrainRegion>, (3) <BrainRegion>ipsilateral medial superior olive</BrainRegion>, (4) <BrainRegion>ipsilateral ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus</BrainRegion>, (5) <BrainRegion>ipsilateral and contralateral dorsal nucleus of the lateral lemniscus</BrainRegion>, and (6) <BrainRegion>contralateral inferior colliculus</BrainRegion>. In addition, <BrainRegion>ipsilateral cochlear nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>ipsilateral and contralateral intermediate nucleus of the lateral lemniscus</BrainRegion>, ipsilateral, and to a lesser extent contralateral, <BrainRegion>periolivary nuclei</BrainRegion> project to <BrainRegion>inferior colliculus</BrainRegion>. Of these nuclei, the <BrainRegion>lateral superior olive</BrainRegion> projects exclusively to <BrainRegion>ICVL</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>ipsilateral cochlear nucleus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>contralateral inferior colliculus</BrainRegion> project mostly, if not exclusively, to <BrainRegion>ICDM</BrainRegion>. Many of these projections demonstrate a cochleotopic organization and frequency a nucleotopic organization as well. A cochleotopic organization of the projections is apparent for <BrainRegion>cochlear nucleus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>superior olivary complex</BrainRegion>. A nucleotopic organization suggests that the heaviest terminations of <BrainRegion>contralateral inferior colliculus</BrainRegion> are medial and dorsal in <BrainRegion>inferior colliculus</BrainRegion>, of <BrainRegion>medial superior olive</BrainRegion> are dorsal and lateral, of <BrainRegion>superior olivary complex</BrainRegion> are rostral, of <BrainRegion>cochlear nucleus</BrainRegion> are caudal, and of <BrainRegion>ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus</BrainRegion> are caudal.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>An ultrastructural examination of early ventral root formation in amphibia.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The morphology of early interactions between neural tube and myotome in the amphibian embryo and tail regenerate was examined using the electron microscope. Two types of contacts were observed. At the most primitive level where the myotome was yet unsegmented, multiple adhesive-type contacts linked neural tube and myotome. In newly segmented areas early ventral roots were recognizable as small bundles of one to five axons extending the short distance to the myotome. There was only one bundle per segment and in addition to axons, each bundle always contained one or more primitive glial cell processes which accompanied axons as they left the cord. At points of root exit primitive glial processes appeared to funnel axons into the root. The cytoarchitecture of the cord and the new roots suggested that the primitive glia may play a role in pathfinding for motor axons as they leave the cord and extend toward their targets.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Periventricular</BrainRegion> efferent neurons in the <BrainRegion>optic tectum</BrainRegion> of rainbow trout.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The efferent connections and axonal and dendritic morphologies of <BrainRegion>periventricular</BrainRegion> neurons were examined in the <BrainRegion>optic tectum</BrainRegion> of rainbow trout to classify <BrainRegion>periventricular</BrainRegion> efferent neurons in salmonids. Among the target nuclei of <BrainRegion>tectal</BrainRegion> efferents, tracer injections to the following four structures labeled <BrainRegion>periventricular</BrainRegion> neurons: the <BrainRegion>area pretectalis pars dorsalis</BrainRegion> (APd), <BrainRegion>nucleus pretectalis superficialis pars magnocellularis</BrainRegion> (PSm), <BrainRegion>nucleus ventrolateralis of torus semicircularis</BrainRegion> (TS), and <BrainRegion>nucleus isthmi</BrainRegion> (NI). Two types of <BrainRegion>periventricular</BrainRegion> neurons were labeled by injections to the <BrainRegion>area pretectalis pars dorsalis</BrainRegion>(APd) . One of them had an apical dendrite ramifying at the <BrainRegion>stratum fibrosum et griseum superficiale</BrainRegion> (SFGS), with an axon that bifurcated into two branches at the <BrainRegion>stratum griseum centrale</BrainRegion> (SGC), and the other had an apical dendrite ramifying at the <BrainRegion>stratum griseum centrale</BrainRegion>(SGC) . Two types of <BrainRegion>periventricular</BrainRegion> neurons were labeled after injections to the <BrainRegion>torus semicircularis</BrainRegion>(TS) . One of them had an apical dendrite ramifying at the boundary between the <BrainRegion>stratum opticum</BrainRegion> (SO) and the <BrainRegion>stratum fibrosum et griseum superficiale</BrainRegion>(SFGS) , and the other had dendritic branches restricted to the <BrainRegion>stratum album centrale</BrainRegion> or <BrainRegion>stratum periventriculare</BrainRegion>. Injections to the pars magnocellularis(<BrainRegion>PSm</BrainRegion>) and <BrainRegion>nucleus isthmi</BrainRegion>(NI) labeled <BrainRegion>periventricular</BrainRegion> neurons of the same type with an apical dendrite ramifying at the <BrainRegion>stratum opticum</BrainRegion>(SO) and a characteristic axon that split into superficial and deep branches projecting to the pars magnocellularis(<BrainRegion>PSm</BrainRegion>) and <BrainRegion>nucleus isthmi</BrainRegion>(NI) , respectively. This cell type also possessed axonal branches that terminated within the <BrainRegion>tectum</BrainRegion>. These results indicate that <BrainRegion>periventricular</BrainRegion> efferent neurons can be classified into at least five types that possess type-specific axonal and dendritic morphologies. We also describe other <BrainRegion>tectal</BrainRegion> neurons labeled by the present injections.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Morphology and kainate-receptor immunoreactivity of identified neurons within the <BrainRegion>entorhinal cortex</BrainRegion> projecting to <BrainRegion>superior temporal sulcus</BrainRegion> in the cynomolgus monkey.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Projections of the <BrainRegion>entorhinal cortex</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion> are well known from the classical studies of Cajal (Ramon y Cajal, 1904) and Lorente de Nó (1933). Projections from the <BrainRegion>entorhinal cortex</BrainRegion> to <BrainRegion>neocortical areas</BrainRegion> are less well understood. Such connectivity is likely to underlie the consolidation of long-term declarative memory in <BrainRegion>neocortical</BrainRegion> sites. In the present study, a projection arising in layer V of the <BrainRegion>entorhinal cortex</BrainRegion> and terminating in a polymodal association area of the <BrainRegion>superior temporal gyrus</BrainRegion> has been identified with the use of retrograde tracing. The dendritic arbors of neurons giving rise to this projection were further investigated by cell filling and confocal microscopy with computer reconstruction. This analysis demonstrated that the dendritic arbor of identified projection neurons was largely confined to layer V, with the exception of a solitary, simple apical dendrite occasionally ascending to superficial laminae but often confined to the lamina dissecans (layer IV). Finally, immunoreactivity for glutamate-receptor subunit proteins GluR 5/6/7 of the dendritic arbor of identified <BrainRegion>entorhinal</BrainRegion> projection neurons was examined. The solitary apical dendrite of identified <BrainRegion>entorhinal</BrainRegion> projection neurons was prominently immunolabeled for GluR 5/6/7, as was the dendritic arbor of basilar dendrites of these neurons. The restriction of the large bulk of the dendritic arbor of identified <BrainRegion>entorhinal</BrainRegion> projection neurons to layer V implies that these neurons are likely to be heavily influenced by <BrainRegion>hippocampal</BrainRegion> output arriving in the deep layers of the <BrainRegion>entorhinal cortex</BrainRegion>. Immunoreactivity for GluR 5/6/7 throughout the dendritic arbor of such neurons indicates that this class of glutamate receptor is in a position to play a prominent role in mediating excitatory neurotransmission within <BrainRegion>hippocampal</BrainRegion>-<BrainRegion>entorhinal</BrainRegion> circuits.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Distribution and light microscopic features of granule cells in the <BrainRegion>cochlear nuclei</BrainRegion> of cat, rat, and mouse.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>In the present study the cytology and the topography of the <BrainRegion>cochlear</BrainRegion> granule cell domain (a comprehensive term introduced here for all granule cell-containing regions of the <BrainRegion>cochlear nuclear complex</BrainRegion>) have been studied light microscopically in Nissl, Bielschowsky, and Golgi-Del Rio-Hortega material of cats, rats, and mice; in Golig rapid material of 0-14-day-old kittens; and in sections of 6-week-old kittens following HRP injections in the <BrainRegion>superficial dorsal cochlear nucleus</BrainRegion> (DCN). The domain has been parcellated in seven subdivisions which, in spite of some species&apos; differences, are easily identifiable in all of the included animals. The cochlear granule cells are considered as a particular class of neuron, which is slightly different from, but nevertheless principally similar to the <BrainRegion>cerebellar</BrainRegion> granule cells in both shape and mode of neuronal connections. The digitiform terminals of the <BrainRegion>cochlear</BrainRegion> granule cells differentiate after the first two weeks of extrauterine life. In several respects these cells show larger variation among species than do the <BrainRegion>cerebellar</BrainRegion> granules, the similarity between the two classes of granule cells being most conspicuous in the rodent. The silver, Golgi rapid, and HRP material suggest that all, or at least the majority, of the granule cell axons project to the molecular layer of the <BrainRegion>dorsal cochlear nucleus</BrainRegion>(DCN) , forming parallel fibers similar to those of the <BrainRegion>cerebellar cortex</BrainRegion>. Also, the <BrainRegion>cochlear</BrainRegion> parallel fibers traverse the spiny apical dendrites of principal neurons (the pyramidal cells) and the smoother dendrites of molecular layer stellate cells.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Anatomy of the Hesse photoreceptor cell axonal system in the central nervous system of amphioxus.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The present study reports the organization of the Hesse cell axonal system in the central nervous system of the amphioxus, with the use of a polyclonal antiserum raised against lamprey gonadotropin-releasing hormone-I (GnRH-I). In the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>, the rhabdomeric photoreceptor cells of the bicellular organs were well labeled with this antibody. These cells sent smooth, straight, lateral processes that bent and became beaded as they passed ventrally and crossed to the contralateral side of the cord. There, the processes of several cells aggregated to give rise to a longitudinal fiber bundle. Beaded collaterals of these processes were directed to ventral neuropil and did not appear to contact giant Rohde cell axons. The crossed projections of the Hesse photoreceptors are compared with those of vertebrate <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> ganglion cells. Other antisera raised against GnRH weakly labeled rhabdomeric photoreceptors located dorsally in the brain, the Joseph cells. The finding that GnRH antibodies label amphioxus photoreceptor cells and axons is not definitive proof that the photoreceptors contain GnRH. Regardless of whether the antibody recognizes amphioxus GnRH, which has not yet been identified by structure, the antibody has revealed the processes of the Hesse photoreceptor cells.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>The distribution of acetylcholinesterase in the <BrainRegion>hippocampal formation</BrainRegion> of the monkey.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>In order to study the distribution of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in the primate <BrainRegion>hippocampal formation</BrainRegion>, we have stained serial sections through the brains of nine macaque monkeys for acetylcholinesterase(AChE) by two variants of the Koelle acetylthiocholine method. We have found a distinctive pattern of staining in the <BrainRegion>hippocampal formation</BrainRegion> which varies in intensity both from region to region, and along rostrocaudal and radial gradients within each region. In the <BrainRegion>dentate gyrus</BrainRegion>, there is intense staining of the inner one-third of the molecular layer with much lighter staining in the rest of the molecular layer except for a moderately stained band at its outer edge. In the caudal half of the <BrainRegion>dentate gyrus</BrainRegion>, the inner portion of the molecular layer is less intensely stained though there is a distinctly denser band of staining just above, and partly within, the superficial margin of the granule cell layer. The granule cells are unstained but there are acetylcholinesterase(AChE) -positive fibers which run through the granule cell layer to the molecular layer. The <BrainRegion>hilar region of the dentate gyrus</BrainRegion> has a narrow band of heavy staining (which corresponds to an acellular layer in Nissl-stained sections) just subjacent to the granule cell layer; the remainder of the hilus, where most of the hilar cells reside, is less intensely stained and at caudal levels is almost entirely unstained. In the <BrainRegion>regio inferior of the hippocampus</BrainRegion>, there is intense staining of the <BrainRegion>stratum oriens</BrainRegion> which extends into the pyramidal cell layer; the <BrainRegion>stratum radiatum</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>stratum lacunosum- moleculare</BrainRegion> are also stained and here the staining pattern shows some degree of stratification. By contrast, most of the alveus, the pyramidal cell somata, and the layer of mossy fibers (<BrainRegion>stratum lucidum</BrainRegion>) are unstained. The border region between <BrainRegion>regio inferior and regio superior of the hippocampus</BrainRegion> (field <BrainRegion>CA2</BrainRegion> of Lorente de No, &apos;34) is especially heavily stained. This contrasts markedly with regio superior, which is more lightly stained than regio inferior. <BrainRegion>Stratum oriens</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>stratum radiatum of regio superior</BrainRegion> have a more evenly distributed pattern of staining, though the intensity of staining increases sharply at the border with the <BrainRegion>subiculum</BrainRegion>. <BrainRegion>Stratum lacunosum- moleculare</BrainRegion> is only lightly stained throughout much of the transverse extent of regio superior but there is also a conspicuous and constant patch of heavier staining at the border with the <BrainRegion>subiculum</BrainRegion>.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Mitotic neuroblasts determine neuritic patterning of progeny.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Neuronal precursor proliferation and axodendritic outgrowth have been regarded as strictly sequential, with process formation presumably beginning after mitotic activity ceases. We now report that sympathetic precursors in vitro often elaborate long neurites before dividing. Of 437 neuroblasts observed in 48 time-lapse recordings, 42 neuroblasts divided. Thirty (71%) of these mitotic neuroblasts had neurites prior to cytokinesis. &quot;Paramitotic" neurites were found to contain microtubules (MTs), indicating that precursors elaborate neuritic cytoskeleton during proliferation. Remarkably, the precise neuritic pattern exhibited by parental neuroblasts was consistently reproduced by daughter cell pairs. Preservation of neuritic morphology occurred through asymmetric division, with individual neurites allocated to specific daughter cells. Paramitotic neurites either remained intact throughout mitosis (12 of 65), or "retracted" into the soma during prophase and then "regrew" within minutes after cytokinesis (53 of 65). "Retraction" and "regrowth" involved resorption of cytoplasm into the soma, then refilling of residual cell membrane, resulting in recapitulation of the parental neurite pattern. Paramitotic neuritogenesis appears to be intrinsically driven, but is responsive to environmental signals. The culture substrate influenced neurite length, but not the response of paramitotic neurites during mitosis or the preservation of neuritic morphology. However, the incidence of neurite-bearing neuroblasts increased from 38 +/- 1.3% to 94 +/- 1.1% with growth factor treatment. The surprisingly high incidence of paramitotic neurites and the fidelity with which patterning was conserved across cell generations raise the possibility that mitotic precursors engage in pathfinding. Our studies suggest a novel link between neurogenesis and cytoarchitectonic patterning.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Selective spread of neurotropic herpesviruses in the rat <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Transsynaptically spreading viruses are widely used for tracing neuronal circuits in both the central and peripheral nervous systems. However, viruses are capricious tools with selective spreading properties that can produce false-negative results. Using herpes simplex virus type 1 and two pseudorabies virus strains, we aimed at mapping quantitatively neuronal connections in the rat <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion>. We found that none of the tested viruses infected <BrainRegion>CA3</BrainRegion> pyramidal neurons across synapses following inoculation into the <BrainRegion>CA1 area</BrainRegion>. Combined injections of the viruses with the retrograde tracer cholera toxin B (CTB) resulted in cholera toxin B(CTB) , but not virus labeling of <BrainRegion>CA3</BrainRegion> pyramidal neurons. In contrast, other brain regions known to send inputs to the <BrainRegion>CA1</BrainRegion> (the <BrainRegion>entorhinal cortex</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>medial septum</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>diagonal band of Broca</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>raphe nuclei</BrainRegion>) were transsynaptically infected. Our results indicate that <BrainRegion>Schaffer collaterals of CA3</BrainRegion> pyramidal cells lack the appropriate cellular machinery for successful neurotropic herpesvirus infection. After injections of viruses into the <BrainRegion>dentate gyrus/CA3 area</BrainRegion>, we found labeling in commissurally projecting mossy cells and their afferent granule cells but not in <BrainRegion>contralateral CA3</BrainRegion> pyramidal cells. Using this unique spreading property, we estimated that single mossy cells receive input from a compact cluster of 30-40 granule cells.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Serotoninergic, noradrenergic, and peptidergic innervation of <BrainRegion>Onuf&apos;s nucleus</BrainRegion> of normal and transected <BrainRegion>spinal cords</BrainRegion> of baboons (Papio papio).</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>We have investigated with light and electron microscope immunocytochemistry the aminergic and peptidergic innervation of <BrainRegion>Onuf&apos;s nucleus</BrainRegion> in adult baboons. This nucleus, located in the ventrolateral part of the <BrainRegion>sacral spinal cord</BrainRegion> (S2 and S3), is considered to control urethral and anal sphincters and penile muscles. By comparison of intact and transected <BrainRegion>spinal cords</BrainRegion>, we have found that serotoninergic innervation has two origins: first, supraspinal, innervating the whole nucleus, with a possible predominance in the dorsal half; and second, intraspinal, corresponding to the ventral half of the nucleus. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone innervation appears largely coincident with serotonin, both in intact and transected <BrainRegion>spinal cords</BrainRegion>. Noradrenaline is exclusively of supraspinal origin, as attested by its disappearance below the level of the section. Substance P, calcitonin gene-related peptide, and Leu- and Met-enkephalin, which profusely innervate <BrainRegion>Onuf&apos;s nucleus</BrainRegion>, are on the contrary not affected by the transection. They most likely originate from the cord itself or the dorsal root ganglia. Thus, <BrainRegion>Onuf&apos;s nucleus</BrainRegion> innervation in the baboon arises both from supraspinal and intraspinal sources. The present study provides an anatomical basis for both voluntary and reflex controls of excretory and sexual functions in a primate. The same neurotransmitter (serotonin) according to its cell origin and discrete topography could exert different influences upon the same effector system.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Localization and characterization of angiotensin II receptor binding and angiotensin converting enzyme in the human <BrainRegion>medulla oblongata</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Angiotensin II receptor and angiotensin converting enzyme distributions in the human <BrainRegion>medulla oblongata</BrainRegion> were localised by quantitative in vitro autoradiography. Angiotensin II receptors were labelled with the antagonist analogue 125I-[Sar1, Ile8] AII while angiotensin converting enzyme was labelled with 125I-351A, a derivative of the specific converting enzyme inhibitor, lisinopril. Angiotensin II receptor binding and angiotensin converting enzyme are present in high concentrations in the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>dorsal motor nucleus of vagus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>rostral and caudal ventrolateral reticular nucleus</BrainRegion>, and in a band connecting the dorsal and ventral regions. In the <BrainRegion>rostral and caudal ventrolateral reticular nucleus</BrainRegion>, angiotensin II receptors are distributed in a punctate pattern that registers with neuronal cell bodies. The distribution and density of these cell bodies closely resemble those of catecholamine-containing neurones mapped by others. In view of the known interactions of angiotensin II with both central and peripheral catecholamine-containing neurons of laboratory animals, the current anatomical findings suggest similar interactions between these neuroactive compounds in the human central nervous system. The presence of angiotensin II receptors and angiotensin converting enzyme in the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>dorsal motor nucleus of vagus</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>rostral and caudal ventrolateral reticular nucleus</BrainRegion> demonstrates sites for central angiotensin II to exert its known actions on vasopressin release and autonomic functions including blood pressure control. These data also suggest a possible interaction between angiotensin II and central catecholeminergic systems.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Partial characterization of lectin binding sites of <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> photoreceptor outer segments and interphotoreceptor matrix.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>We have used cytochemistry together with exoglycosidase digestion and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to partially characterize lectin binding sites of the interphotoreceptor matrix and of photoreceptor outer segments. In order to obtain uniform access of reagents to all regions of the preparation, we have used a procedure in which plastic sections are etched with sodium ethoxide prior to cytochemical analysis. Neuraminidase pretreatment of plastic-embedded sections of Xenopus laevis eyecups leads to a loss of wheat germ agglutinin binding and a concomitant appearance of Ricinus communis agglutinin binding to the interphotoreceptor matrix. In contrast, wheat germ agglutinin binding to the outer segments is not altered by the neuraminidase pretreatment. These results suggest that wheat germ agglutinin binding sites of interphotoreceptor matrix are sialoglyconjugates and that outer segment binding sites are not sialoglycoconjugates. Enzyme digestions followed by lectin cytochemistry of matrix polypeptides separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis do not identify a likely candidate to give rise to the cytochemical staining patterns. Lectin cytochemistry of <BrainRegion>retinas</BrainRegion> from which the interphotoreceptor matrix has been extracted do not show a loss of wheat germ agglutinin binding sites to the matrix. These results suggest that the major wheat germ agglutinin binding sites in the interphotoreceptor matrix are to as yet unidentified sialoglycoconjugates.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Cholinergic innervation of the human <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion>: dual origin and differential nuclear distribution.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The cholinergic innervation of the human <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion> was studied with antibodies against the enzyme choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and nerve growth factor receptor (NGFr). Acetylcholinesterase histochemistry was used to delineate nuclear boundaries. All <BrainRegion>thalamic nuclei</BrainRegion> displayed choline acetyltransferase(ChAT) -positive axons and varicosities. Only the <BrainRegion>medial habenula</BrainRegion> contained choline acetyltransferase(ChAT) -positive perikarya. Some <BrainRegion>intralaminar nuclei (central medial, central lateral, and paracentral)</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>reticular nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>midline nuclei (paraventricular and reuniens)</BrainRegion>, some nuclei associated with the <BrainRegion>limbic system</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>anterodorsal nucleus</BrainRegion> and medially situated patches in the <BrainRegion>mediodorsal nucleus</BrainRegion>) and the <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion> displayed the highest density of choline acetyltransferase(ChAT) -positive axonal varicosities. The remaining <BrainRegion>sensory relay nuclei</BrainRegion> and the nuclei interconnected with the <BrainRegion>motor and association cortex</BrainRegion> displayed a lower level of innervation. Immunoreactivity for nerve growth factor receptor(NGFr) was observed in cholinergic neurons of the <BrainRegion>basal forebrain</BrainRegion> but not in cholinergic neurons of the upper <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion>. The contribution of <BrainRegion>basal forebrain</BrainRegion> afferents to the cholinergic innervation of the human <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion> was therefore studied with the aid of nerve growth factor receptor(NGFr) -immunoreactive axonal staining. The <BrainRegion>anterior intralaminar nuclei</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>reticular nucleus</BrainRegion>, and medially situated patches in the <BrainRegion>mediodorsal nucleus</BrainRegion> displayed a substantial number of nerve growth factor receptor(NGFr) -positive varicose axons, presumably originating in the <BrainRegion>basal forebrain</BrainRegion>. Rare nerve growth factor receptor(NGFr) -positive axonal profiles were also seen in many of the other <BrainRegion>thalamic nuclei</BrainRegion>. These observations suggest that <BrainRegion>thalamic nuclei</BrainRegion> affiliated with <BrainRegion>limbic structures</BrainRegion> and with the ascending reticular activating system are likely to be under particularly intense cholinergic influence. While the vast majority of <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> cholinergic input seems to come from the upper <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>intralaminar and reticular nuclei</BrainRegion>, and especially medially situated patches within the <BrainRegion>mediodorsal nucleus</BrainRegion> also appear to receive substantial cholinergic innervation from the <BrainRegion>basal forebrain</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>The effects of partial <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> lesions on activity and size of cells in the <BrainRegion>dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The nasal parts of the adult cat <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> were photocoagulated. In the <BrainRegion>dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion> (dLGN) the projection of the remaining innervation was shown by anterograde transport of 3H-proline after eye injections. The neuronal activity was measured from single cells across the border region between innervated and deafferented parts of layer A of the <BrainRegion>dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(dLGN) contralateral to the lesions. A gradual decrease from normal light-excitability to total inexcitability was observed over a range of 300 micron. The perikaryal cell sizes measured in the same part of the <BrainRegion>dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(dLGN) displayed a concomitant decrease. Blockage of the afferent impulses by chronic application of tetrodotoxin did not change the results, suggesting that it is the loss of connections, not the loss of activity, that produces the transneuronal atrophy in the adult cat <BrainRegion>dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(dLGN) .</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Regional distribution of binding sites for neuropeptide Y in cat and monkey <BrainRegion>visual cortex</BrainRegion> determined by in vitro receptor autoradiography.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The goal of this study was to elucidate the precise regional and laminar distribution of neuropeptide Y (NPY) binding sites in feline and primate <BrainRegion>visual cortex</BrainRegion>. By means of in vitro receptor autoradiography, neuropeptide Y(NPY) binding sites in primate and feline visual cortex were specifically labeled with 3H- neuropeptide Y(NPY) . In cat <BrainRegion>area 17</BrainRegion>, the highest density of neuropeptide Y(NPY) -binding sites was present in lamina I and the upper half of lamina II. The density then gradually decreased towards lamina VI. <BrainRegion>Areas 18 and 19</BrainRegion> exhibited a similar binding site-density profile. The decrease in density from superficial to deep layers was more gradual in <BrainRegion>area 18</BrainRegion> than in <BrainRegion>areas 17 and 19</BrainRegion>. In monkey <BrainRegion>primary visual cortex</BrainRegion> (V1), layer IVc presented a high concentration of neuropeptide Y(NPY) binding sites, in addition to a dense zone of binding sites in layer I. Monkey <BrainRegion>secondary visual cortex</BrainRegion> (V2) displays a similar dense zone in layer I, but lacks such high density of neuropeptide Y(NPY) binding sites in layer IV. Therefore, the border between <BrainRegion>primary and secondary visual cortex</BrainRegion> coincides with the abrupt disappearance of this latter high density in layer IV. In cat as well as in monkey <BrainRegion>visual cortex</BrainRegion>, no significant differences were found between regions representing central vision and those representing the peripheral parts of the visual field. Comparison of our results for neuropeptide Y(NPY) binding sites with the distribution of alpha 1-adrenergic receptors, as recently described by Rakic et al. (J. Neurosci. 8(10):3670-3690, 1988) for primate and Parkinson et al. (Brain Res. 457:70-78, 1988) for feline <BrainRegion>visual cortex</BrainRegion>, revealed that those two patterns are very similar.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Localization of kainate receptors at the cone pedicles of the primate <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>In the macaque monkey <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> cone pedicles, the output synapses of cone photoreceptors, contain between 20 and 45 ribbon synapses (triads), which are the release sites for glutamate, the cone transmitter. Several hundred postsynaptic dendrites contact individual cone pedicles, and we studied the glutamate receptors expressed and clustered at these contacts, particularly the kainate receptor subunits GluR5, GluR6/7, and KA2. Pre- and postembedding immunocytochemistry and electron microscopy were used to localize GluR5 and GluR6/7 to specific synaptic contacts at the cone pedicle base. The GluR5 subunit was aggregated at bipolar cell flat contacts. The GluR6/7 subunit was aggregated at bipolar cell flat contacts and at the desmosome-like junctions formed by horizontal cell processes underneath the cone pedicles. KA2 immunoreactivity was observed at the invaginating dendritic tips of ON-cone and rod bipolar cells, which we interpret as a cross-reactivity of the KA2 antiserum with some other, unknown protein of the monkey <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>. Kainate receptors are preferentially expressed by OFF-cone bipolar cells and to a lesser extent by horizontal cells. We also performed double-labeling experiments with the ribbon-specific marker bassoon and with antibodies against GluR5 and GluR6/7 in order to define the position of the flat bipolar cell contacts with respect to the triads. There was a tendency of GluR6/7 clusters to represent triad-associated contacts, whereas GluR5 clusters represented non-triad-associated contacts. The GluR5 and GluR6/7 subunits were clustered at different bipolar cell contacts. We studied a possible cone-selective expression of the kainate receptor subunits by double labeling cone pedicles for the S-cone opsin and for the different receptor subunits. We observed a reduced expression of both GluR5 and GluR6/7 at the S-cone pedicles. The reduced expression of GluR6/7 was analyzed in more detail and it appears to be a consequence of a horizontal cell-specific expression: H1 horizontal cells express GluR6/7, whereas H2 horizontal cells, which preferentially innervate S-cones, show no expression of GluR6/7.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Postnatal development of cholinergic neurotransmitter enzymes in the mouse <BrainRegion>cerebellum</BrainRegion>. Biochemical, light microscopic and electron microscopic cytochemical investigations.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The activity and distribution of the cholinergic neurotransmitter enzymes acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and choline acetyltransferase (ChAc) in the developing <BrainRegion>cerebellum</BrainRegion> of the mouse were investigated using biochemical assays and light microscopic histochemistry for acetylcholinesterase(AChE) and choline acetyltransferase(ChAc) , and electron microscopic histochemistry for acetylcholinesterase(AChE) . Postnatal alterations in the levels of acetylcholinesterase(AChE) and choline acetyltransferase(ChAc) in the <BrainRegion>cerebellum</BrainRegion> of the mouse are characterized by a divergent pattern. During the first two postnatal weeks, acetylcholinesterase(AChE) activity increases progressively, whereas choline acetyltransferase(ChAc) activity remains low. Beyond day 14, when acetylcholinesterase(AChE) activity is steady or gradually decreasing, choline acetyltransferase(ChAc) increases sharply to reach a peak on day 32. Histochemically, acetylcholinesterase(AChE) activity is associated with the glomeruli and the Golgi cells of the internal granular layer, the medullary layer, and the <BrainRegion>deep cerebellar nuclei</BrainRegion>. Purkinje cells exhibit transient staining between days 2 and 9. At the structural level, acetylcholinesterase(AChE) staining is first demonstrated on day 6 within the Golgi cell soma, on day 9 at the mossy fiber-granule cell synapse, and on day 11 at the Golgi terminal-granule cell synapse. The staining intensity of these structures reaches that of the adult on day 19. The histochemical reaction for choline acetyltransferase(ChAc) is localized to moderate number of presumed Bergmann glial cells, a few large cells of the <BrainRegion>deep cerebellar nuclei</BrainRegion>, small numbers of Golgi cells, and all immature Purkinje cells. The molecular distribution of choline acetyltransferase(ChAc) sharply contrasts with the localization established by other methods previously and is interpreted in the light of the drawbacks of the histochemical procedure. The biochemical fluctuations in acetylcholinesterase(AChE) activity, correlated with the histochemical and cytochemical data, suggest that the postnatal increases in the enzyme are related to the ingrowth of the mossy fibers and to the maturation of the acetylcholinesterase(AChE) -positive Golgi cells. Histochemical evidence for the correlation between the ontogenetic increases in <BrainRegion>cerebellar</BrainRegion> choline acetyltransferase(ChAc) activity and progressive mossy fiber innervation must await the application of the immunohistochemical method to the developing <BrainRegion>cerebellum</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Quantitative analysis of neuronal morphologies in the mouse <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> visualized by using a genetically directed reporter.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>An alkaline phosphatase (AP) reporter has been used to visualize detailed morphologies for all major classes of <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> neurons in the adult mouse. The analysis was performed on <BrainRegion>retinas</BrainRegion> in which alkaline phosphatase(AP) expression was activated by Cre-mediated DNA recombination in a small fraction of cells. Recombination was controlled pharmacologically and, to a first approximation, appears to have occurred randomly. The morphologies of 794 inner retinal neurons have been analyzed by measuring arbor area, stratification level, and neurite branching patterns. When analyzed in this multidimensional parametric space, the cells can be clustered into subgroups by visual inspection and by using the Ward&apos;s and K-means algorithms. One application of this cell morphology data set and cluster analysis is as a standard for comparison with the <BrainRegion>retinas</BrainRegion> of genetically altered mice. This work illustrates the utility and feasibility of genetically directed marking methods for large-scale surveys of neuronal morphology.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>The <BrainRegion>deep mesencephalic nucleus</BrainRegion> as an output center of <BrainRegion>basal ganglia</BrainRegion>: morphological and electrophysiological similarities with the <BrainRegion>substantia nigra</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The <BrainRegion>deep mesencephalic nucleus</BrainRegion> (DMN) is a large midbrain <BrainRegion>reticular region</BrainRegion> between the <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>substantia nigra compacta</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>medial geniculate body</BrainRegion>. Although some data suggest that it is involved in nociception and visceral control, its functions remain unclear. In the present study, by using morphological (combination of anterograde and retrograde tracers with immunocytochemistry and in situ hibrydization) and electrophysiological (firing activity and transynaptic response to <BrainRegion>striatal</BrainRegion> stimulation) methods, we show that a subpopulation of <BrainRegion>deep mesencephalic nucleus</BrainRegion>(DMN) cells shares many morphological and electrophysiological characteristics with those of the <BrainRegion>substantia nigra reticulata</BrainRegion> (SNR). These similarities include the following: 1) firing rate, firing pattern, and conduction velocity; 2) expression of GAD65, GAD67, and PV; 3) excitatory and inhibitory inputs from the <BrainRegion>striatum</BrainRegion>; and 4) projections to the <BrainRegion>ventral thalamus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus</BrainRegion>. Some differences were also found. In comparison with SN, <BrainRegion>deep mesencephalic nucleus</BrainRegion>(DMN) cells and <BrainRegion>striatal</BrainRegion> afferents are more sparsely distributed and they show conspicuous contralateral projections to the <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion>. This suggests that, similarly to the <BrainRegion>substantia nigra reticulata</BrainRegion>(SNR) , the <BrainRegion>deep mesencephalic nucleus</BrainRegion>(DMN) acts as an output center of <BrainRegion>basal ganglia</BrainRegion> and probably facilitates the inter-hemispheric regulation of these centers.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Histochemical mapping of dopamine neurons and fiber pathways in dog <BrainRegion>mesencephalon</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>A topographic mapping of dopamine (DA)-containing neurons and fibers was done mainly in the <BrainRegion>mesencephalon</BrainRegion> of the dog using the fluorescent histochemical technique of Falck and Hillarp. The extensive dopamine(DA) neuron system was found to be located in the <BrainRegion>ventral and medial regions of the mesencephalon</BrainRegion>; the <BrainRegion>pars compacta of the substantia nigra</BrainRegion>, the area almost corresponding to the <BrainRegion>ventral tegmental area of Tsai</BrainRegion> (which consists of three groups, a caudal, the <BrainRegion>nucleus parabrachialis pigmentosus</BrainRegion>, a ventral, the <BrainRegion>nucleus paranigralis</BrainRegion> and a rostral, the <BrainRegion>caudal part of the nucleus tegmentalis ventralis of Tsai</BrainRegion>), the <BrainRegion>nucleus linearis of the raphe</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>mesencephalic reticular formation</BrainRegion>. The nigro-neostriatal projection can be traced in the non-treated or nialamide plus L-dopa treated puppies without the lesion-degeneration technique. Most fibers arising from these dopamine(DA) cell groups assemble at the <BrainRegion>prerubral area</BrainRegion> and ascend just dorsal to the medial forebrain bundle. Most fibers turn laterally at the <BrainRegion>lateral hypothalamus</BrainRegion> and enter the <BrainRegion>neostriatum</BrainRegion> via the <BrainRegion>dorsal part of the subthalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>zona incerta</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>capsula interna</BrainRegion>. These findings show that the distribution of dopamine(DA) neurons and the nigro-neostriatal pathway are fundamentally similar to those in other mammals. In this study, the processes of the <BrainRegion>nigral</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>paranigral</BrainRegion> dopamine(DA) neurons have been demonstrated to project into the <BrainRegion>pars reticulata</BrainRegion> in the dog.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<AbstractText><BrainRegion>Retinal</BrainRegion> terminals in the <BrainRegion>pretectum</BrainRegion> were labelled by anterograde axonal transport of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) after injecting the enzyme into one eye. <BrainRegion>Pretectal</BrainRegion> neurons were retrogradely labelled by horseradish peroxidase(HRP) -injections into the dorsal cap of the <BrainRegion>inferior olive</BrainRegion>. Electrophysiological recordings were performed in the same animal. This procedure showed that direction-selective neurons in the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the optic tract</BrainRegion> (NOT) projecting to the <BrainRegion>dorsal cap of the inferior olive</BrainRegion> lie dorsal and lateral to the <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> terminal clusters. Direction-unselective neurons sensitive to high stimulus velocities (jerk-neurons) were localized within the areas of <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> terminal clusters. Both jerk-neurons and <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> terminal clusters never overlapped with retrogradely labelled neurons. Latency measurements to stimulation of the <BrainRegion>optic chiasm</BrainRegion> (OX) confirmed a monosynaptic W-cell projection to the direction-selective <BrainRegion>nucleus of the optic tract</BrainRegion>(NOT) cells and indicated a predominantly monosynaptic Y-cell projection to the jerk-neurons.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Limb specific connections of the cat <BrainRegion>magnocellular red nucleus</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Afferent and efferent connections of the limb specific divisions of the cat <BrainRegion>magnocellular red nucleus</BrainRegion> (RNm) were traced using the bidirectional transport of wheatgerm agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase complex (WGA-HRP). Injection sites within <BrainRegion>forelimb or hindlimb RNm</BrainRegion> regions were identified by microelectrode recording and confirmed by the position of labeled rubrospinal terminals. Additional injections into structures that project to, or receive input from, <BrainRegion>RNm</BrainRegion> confirmed the somatotopic organization of these pathways. The <BrainRegion>forelimb region of RNm</BrainRegion> receives input from the <BrainRegion>posteriolateral part of the anterior interpositus nucleus</BrainRegion> (NIA) and the <BrainRegion>intermediate part of the posterior interpositus nucleus</BrainRegion> (NIP). The <BrainRegion>hindlimb region of RNm</BrainRegion> receives input from <BrainRegion>anteriomedial NIA</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>medial NIP</BrainRegion>. Terminals of <BrainRegion>NIA</BrainRegion> cells densely fill all of <BrainRegion>RNm</BrainRegion>, but terminals of <BrainRegion>NIP</BrainRegion> cells form a half shell on the <BrainRegion>medial, ventral, and posterior borders of RNm</BrainRegion> without encroaching on <BrainRegion>RNm</BrainRegion>&apos;s lateral edge or central core. <BrainRegion>Forelimb and hindlimb RNm</BrainRegion> are reciprocally connected with the <BrainRegion>caudal cuneate and gracile nuclei</BrainRegion> respectively. There is little or no input to <BrainRegion>RNm</BrainRegion> from the <BrainRegion>medial or lateral cerebellar nuclei</BrainRegion>. <BrainRegion>Forelimb RNm</BrainRegion>, which also contains a face representation, projects to the <BrainRegion>lateral reticular nucleus</BrainRegion>, cell group f of the <BrainRegion>inferior vestibular nucleus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>facial nucleus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>main sensory nucleus of the trigeminal nerve</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>caudal cuneate nucleus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>parvicellular reticular formation</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>cervical segments of the spinal cord</BrainRegion>. A few fibers from <BrainRegion>forelimb RNm</BrainRegion> project directly to motor neurons in the <BrainRegion>lower cervical cord</BrainRegion>. <BrainRegion>Hindlimb RNm</BrainRegion> projects to only the <BrainRegion>lateral reticular nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>gracile nucleus</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>lower spinal segments</BrainRegion>. <BrainRegion>Forelimb and hindlimb RNm</BrainRegion> project to different regions of the <BrainRegion>lateral reticular nucleus</BrainRegion> with some overlap.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Segmental homologies among <BrainRegion>reticulospinal</BrainRegion> neurons in the <BrainRegion>hindbrain</BrainRegion> of the zebrafish larva.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>We have examined the morphology of identified <BrainRegion>reticulospinal</BrainRegion> neurons in larval zebrafish by retrogradely labeling them with horseradish peroxidase. We described the morphology of 27 different types of <BrainRegion>reticulospinal</BrainRegion> neurons found in the <BrainRegion>hindbrain</BrainRegion> 5 days after fertilization. Nineteen of these types are present as single identified neurons on each side of the brain; the others are present as pairs or small groups of cells. The <BrainRegion>hindbrain reticulospinal</BrainRegion> neurons are present in seven bilateral clusters that are spaced periodically along the neuraxis. Each cluster contains two to five different types of <BrainRegion>reticulospinal</BrainRegion> neurons. Cells with similar morphological features are found in adjacent clusters. By considering cell position within the cluster and axon pathway, nearly all of the cells can be assigned to one of about seven serially repeated classes. Independent morphological features of the cells support the same classification. We propose that the clusters represent <BrainRegion>hindbrain</BrainRegion> segments and that the neurons of the same class that are present in the different clusters are segmental homologues. Assuming that this series evolved by successive duplications and divergence of the primitive segments, we have analyzed the changes that may have occurred during the evolution of each new segment. Changes between ipsilaterally and contralaterally projecting axons may have occurred several times during the evolution of the series. In addition, cells may have been added or deleted.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Localization of cholinergic neurons in the <BrainRegion>forebrain</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion> that project to the <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion> of the <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion> in rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>In mammals, the <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion> is responsible for the generation of most circadian rhythms and their entrainment to environmental cues. Cholinergic agents can alter circadian rhythm phase, and fibres immunoreactive for choline acetyltransferase, the biosynthetic enzyme for acetylcholine, are present in the <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion>. Since there are no cholinergic somata in the <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion>, these fibres must represent the terminals of cholinergic neurons whose cell bodies are located elsewhere in the brain. This study was aimed at locating the cholinergic neurons that project to the <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion> by retrograde and anterograde tract-tracing and immunohistochemistry for choline acetyltransferase in the rat. After injection of fluorogold, a retrograde tracer, into the <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion>, retrogradely labelled neurons that were immunopositive for choline acetyltransferase were located throughout the rostrocaudal extent of the cholinergic <BrainRegion>basal nuclear complex</BrainRegion>, with highest densities in the <BrainRegion>substantia innominata</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>nucleus basalis magnocellularis</BrainRegion>. A few cells were also located in the <BrainRegion>medial septum</BrainRegion> and in the <BrainRegion>vertical and horizontal limbs of the diagonal band of Broca</BrainRegion>. In the <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion>, double-labelled neurons were located in the <BrainRegion>laterodorsal tegmental nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>parabigeminal nucleus</BrainRegion>. Injections of the anterograde tracer biocytin in these three <BrainRegion>brainstem nuclei</BrainRegion> resulted in fibre labelling in the <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion>, consistent with the retrograde findings. No clearly double-labelled cells were located in the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>. These results suggest that the <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion> receives cholinergic afferents from both the <BrainRegion>basal forebrain</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>mesopontine tegmentum</BrainRegion> which may mediate cholinergic effects on circadian rhythms.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Structure and function of gustatory neurons in the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion>: II. Relationships between neuronal morphology and physiology.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>This study employed intracellular recording and labeling techniques to examine potential relationships between the physiology and morphology of brainstem gustatory neurons. When we considered the neuronal response to the four &quot;prototypic" tastants, we were able to demonstrate a positive correlation between breadth of responsiveness and the number of dendritic branch points. An analysis of the response to eight tastants also revealed an association between dendritic spine density and the breadth of responsiveness, with more narrowly tuned neurons exhibiting more spines. Interestingly, a neuron's "best response" was a relatively poor predictor of neuronal morphology. When we focused on those neurons that responded to only one tastant, however, a number of potentially important relationships became apparent. We found that the cells that only responded to quinine were smaller than the neurons that only responded to NaCl, HCl, or sucrose. The HCl-only neurons, however, were more widespread in the rostrocaudal dimension that the neurons that only responded to NaCl. A number of additional structure-function relationships were identified when we examined the neuronal response to selected tastants. We found that neurons that responded to sucrose but not quinine, as well as neurons that responded to quinine but not sucrose, were more widespread in the mediolateral dimension than neurons that responded to both sucrose and quinine. We also discovered that the neurons that responded to NaCl, but not to NH4Cl or KCl, were larger than neurons that responded to all three salts. We believe that these results support the hypothesis that there are relationships between the structure and function of gustatory neurons in the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion>, with the data highlighting the importance of three themes: 1) the relationship between dendritic specializations and tuning, 2) the relationship between dendritic arbor orientation and response properties, and 3) the potential importance of stimulus-specific neurons.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Neuronal expression and interaction with the synaptic protein CASK suggest a role for Neph1 and Neph2 in synaptogenesis.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Formation, differentiation, and plasticity of synapses require interactions between pre- and postsynaptic partners. Recently, it was shown that the transmembrane immunoglobulin superfamily protein SYG-1 is required for providing synaptic specificity in C. elegans. However, it is unclear whether the mammalian orthologs of SYG-1 are also involved in local cell interactions to determine specificity during synapse formation. We used in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry, and immunogold electron microscopy to study the temporal and spatial expression of Neph1 and Neph2 in the developing and adult mouse brain. Both proteins show similar patterns with neuronal expression starting around embryonic days 12 and 11, respectively. Expression is strongest in areas of high migratory activity. In the adult brain, Neph1 and Neph2 are predominantly seen in the olfactory nerve layer and the glomerular layer of the <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>, in the hippocampus, and in Purkinje cells of the <BrainRegion>cerebellum</BrainRegion>. At the ultrastructural level, Neph1 and Neph2 are detectable within the dendritic shafts of pyramidal neurons. To a lesser extent, there is also synaptic localization of Neph1 within the <BrainRegion>stratum pyramidale of the hippocampal CA1</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>CA3</BrainRegion> region on both pre- and postsynaptic sites. Here it colocalizes with the synaptic scaffolder calmodulin-associated serin/threonin kinase (CASK), and both Neph1 and Neph2 interact with the PDZ domain of calmodulin-associated serin/threonin kinase(CASK) via their cytoplasmic tail. Our results show that Neph proteins are expressed in the developing nervous system of mammals and suggest that these proteins may have a conserved function in synapse formation or neurogenesis.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Postnatal development of <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> receptor cell axonal arbors.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The mechanisms that subserve the distribution of the terminal arbors of <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> receptor cell axons remain unknown. Elsewhere in the central nervous system, a common theme is early axonal exuberance followed by activity-dependent pruning to achieve the mature distribution. This led to the hypothesis that the orderly morphology of afferent axons in the <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> glomerulus may follow a similar developmental scheme of exuberance followed by pruning. To test this hypothesis, we studied morphological features of <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> receptor neuron (ORN) axonal arbors on postnatal days 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 21. The <BrainRegion>olfactory bulbs</BrainRegion> from Sprague-Dawley rats were processed using a Golgi technique that impregnated <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> receptor neuron(ORN) axons. Axons from each age group were reconstructed by using camera lucida at x100, oil immersion, and morphometrically characterized. In the adult, the percent glomerular area occupied by a single <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> receptor neuron(ORN) axon was 14%, whereas the mean length of branches was 169.67 microm, the sum of branches and varicosities was 27, and the distance to first branch point in glomeruli was 21.98 microm. The values from the younger age groups were not statistically different from those in the adult. Because there was no evidence of early exuberance, our data suggest that <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> receptor neuron(ORN) axons must innervate single glomeruli and arborize in a highly specific manner to achieve the adult pattern. Because our data suggest that <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> receptor neuron(ORN) axons do not follow the hypothesized scheme, it is plausible to suggest that as <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> receptor neuron(ORN) axons innervate a glomerulus during development they arborize to their adult levels but not beyond. This argues strongly that specific cell surface and trophic factors are used by the <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> receptor neuron(ORN) axon to guide glomerular targeting and innervation.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Structural changes of the soleus and the tibialis anterior motoneuron pool during development in the rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The morphological development of motoneuron pools of two hindlimb muscles of the rat, soleus (SOL) and tibialis anterior (TA), was studied in rats ranging in age between 8 and 30 postnatal days (P8-P30). Motoneurons were retrogradely labelled by injecting a cholera toxin B subunit solution directly into the muscles. This resulted in extensive labelling of motoneurons as well as their dendritic trees. The distribution of cross sectional areas of neuronal somata was determined for both muscles at various ages. Somal size increased considerably between P8 and P12, whereas growth was moderate between P12 and P20. The size distribution of soleus(SOL) motoneurons was bimodal from P20, whereas the size distribution of tibialis anterior(TA) motoneurons remained largely unimodal. The morphological development of the dendritic tree was studied qualitatively. The development of dendritic arborization within the soleus(SOL) and the tibialis anterior(TA) motoneuron pool showed major differences. The arborization pattern of dendrites of tibialis anterior(TA) motoneurons was basically multipolar at all ages. In contrast, dendrites of soleus(SOL) neurons tended to line up with the rostro-caudal axis and became organized in longitudinal bundles from P16 onwards. The relatively late appearance of dendrite bundles in the soleus motoneuron pool suggests that they might be related to the fine-tuning of neuronal activity rather than patterning of motor activity. The occurrence of dendrite bundles in soleus(SOL) and not in tibialis anterior(TA) motoneuron pools suggests that they may be related to the different afferent organization of this postural muscle or to its tonic activation pattern.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Localisation of mRNA encoding the protein precursor of galanin in the monkey <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>basal forebrain</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The <BrainRegion>hypothalamic</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>basal forebrain</BrainRegion> sites of synthesis of preprogalanin mRNA were identified in three adult monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) by in situ hybridisation performed with a radiolabelled cRNA probe transcribed from human preprogalanin cDNA. With stringent hybridisation conditions, the cRNA probe was hybridised to free-floating sections containing structures contiguous with the <BrainRegion>rostral hypothalamus</BrainRegion> through to the caudal limit of the <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion> as defined by the <BrainRegion>mammillary bodies</BrainRegion>. Specific hybridisation of the preprogalanin cRNA probe occurred throughout the <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion> but was particularly intense in the <BrainRegion>arcuate</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>paraventricular</BrainRegion> (parvicellular and magnocellular portions), and <BrainRegion>dorsomedial nuclei</BrainRegion>. Moderate hybridisation was found in the <BrainRegion>periventricular nucleus</BrainRegion> and scattered hybridisation in the <BrainRegion>medial preoptic nucleus</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>medial preoptic area</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>anterior and lateral hypothalamic areas</BrainRegion> showed moderate to intense hybridisation in scattered cells. A few cells in the tuberal portion and dorsal cap of the anterior portion of the <BrainRegion>supraoptic nucleus</BrainRegion> were labelled. Isolated cells were also labelled in the <BrainRegion>zona incerta</BrainRegion>. There was little labelling in the <BrainRegion>dorsal hypothalamic area</BrainRegion> but moderate labelling in the <BrainRegion>posterior hypothalamic area</BrainRegion>. Structures contiguous with the <BrainRegion>rostral hypothalamus</BrainRegion> including the <BrainRegion>diagonal band of Broca</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>bed nucleus of stria terminalis</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>substantia innominata</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>basal nucleus of Meynert</BrainRegion> showed intense hybridisation. These data indicate a widespread distribution of preprogalanin mRNA in the monkey <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion>. A comparison with the previously reported distribution of preprogalanin mRNA in the rat, as well as with the distribution of galanin-like immunoreactivity in the rat and human, suggests some important species differences. Of particular interest were differences in the <BrainRegion>supraoptic</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>dorsomedial nuclei</BrainRegion>. The intense hybridisation throughout the <BrainRegion>paraventricular nucleus</BrainRegion> and in the <BrainRegion>rostral arcuate nucleus</BrainRegion> suggests that galanin may play a role in the regulation of both <BrainRegion>posterior and anterior pituitary</BrainRegion> function.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>The distribution of afferent neurones in the <BrainRegion>mesencephalic nucleus of the fifth nerve</BrainRegion> in the cat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The objective of this study was to examine anatomically the distribution of afferent neurones in the <BrainRegion>mesencephalic nucleus of the fifth nerve</BrainRegion> (Mes V). HRP was applied, in separate experiments, to the <BrainRegion>inferior alveolar, infraorbital, and masseter nerves</BrainRegion>, and injected into the masseter muscle and periodontal ligament. Following application of HRP to the masseter muscle and <BrainRegion>masseter nerve, labelled cells were found in the ipsilateral motor nucleus of the fifth nerve</BrainRegion> and in the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral mesencephalic nucleus of the fifth nerve</BrainRegion>(Mes V) . Labelled cells in <BrainRegion>mesencephalic nucleus of the fifth nerve</BrainRegion>(Mes V) , identified as belonging to proprioceptor afferents from jaw-closing muscles, were distributed throughout the full extent of the nucleus. Following application of HRP to the <BrainRegion>inferior alveolar nerve</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>infraorbital nerve</BrainRegion>, and periodontal ligament, labelled cells were found in the ipsilateral trigeminal ganglion and <BrainRegion>mesencephalic nucleus of the fifth nerve</BrainRegion>(Mes V) , and the latter identified as belonging to periodontal receptor afferents. In contrast to the distribution of spindle afferent somata, they were restricted to the caudal region of <BrainRegion>mesencephalic nucleus of the fifth nerve</BrainRegion>(Mes V) . The differential distribution of afferent neurones within <BrainRegion>mesencephalic nucleus of the fifth nerve</BrainRegion>(Mes V) demonstrated in this study confirms previous electrophysiological findings, and its significance is considered.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Association fiber pathways to the <BrainRegion>frontal cortex</BrainRegion> from the <BrainRegion>superior temporal region</BrainRegion> in the rhesus monkey.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The projections to the <BrainRegion>frontal cortex</BrainRegion> that originate from the various areas of the <BrainRegion>superior temporal region</BrainRegion> of the rhesus monkey were investigated with the autoradiographic technique. The results demonstrated that the <BrainRegion>rostral part of the superior temporal gyrus</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>areas Pro, Ts1, and Ts2</BrainRegion>) projects to the <BrainRegion>proisocortical areas of the orbital and medial frontal cortex</BrainRegion>, as well as to the nearby <BrainRegion>orbital areas 13, 12, and 11</BrainRegion>, and to <BrainRegion>medial areas 9, 10, and 14</BrainRegion>. These fibers travel to the <BrainRegion>frontal lobe</BrainRegion> as part of the uncinate fascicle. The middle part of the <BrainRegion>superior temporal gyrus</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>areas Ts3 and paAlt</BrainRegion>) projects predominantly to the <BrainRegion>lateral frontal cortex</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>areas 12, upper 46, and 9</BrainRegion>) and to the <BrainRegion>dorsal aspect of the medial frontal lobe</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>areas 9 and 10</BrainRegion>). Only a small number of these fibers terminated within the <BrainRegion>orbitofrontal cortex</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>temporofrontal</BrainRegion> fibers originating from the <BrainRegion>middle part of the superior temporal gyrus</BrainRegion> occupy the lower portion of the extreme capsule and lie just dorsal to the fibers of the uncinate fascicle. The <BrainRegion>posterior part of the superior temporal gyrus</BrainRegion> projects to the <BrainRegion>lateral frontal cortex</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>area 46</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>dorsal area 8</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>rostralmost part of dorsal area 6</BrainRegion>). Some of the fibers from the <BrainRegion>posterior superior temporal gyrus</BrainRegion> run initially through the extreme capsule and then cross the <BrainRegion>claustrum</BrainRegion> as they ascend to enter the external capsule before continuing their course to the <BrainRegion>frontal lobe</BrainRegion>. A larger group of fibers curves round the caudalmost <BrainRegion>Sylvian fissure</BrainRegion> and travels to the <BrainRegion>frontal cortex</BrainRegion> occupying a position just above and medial to the upper branch of the <BrainRegion>circular sulcus</BrainRegion>. This latter pathway constitutes a part of the classically described arcuate fasciculus.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Expression of EphB receptors and EphrinB ligands in the developing chick <BrainRegion>auditory brainstem</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText><BrainRegion>Nucleus magnocellularis</BrainRegion> (NM) in the avian <BrainRegion>auditory brainstem</BrainRegion> receives auditory input from nerve the VIIIth and projects bilaterally to <BrainRegion>nucleus laminaris</BrainRegion> (NL). This projection preserves binaural segregation in that <BrainRegion>ipsilateral Nucleus magnocellularis</BrainRegion>(NM) projects to dorsal dendrites of <BrainRegion>nucleus laminaris</BrainRegion>(NL) and <BrainRegion>contralateral Nucleus magnocellularis</BrainRegion>(NM) projects to ventral dendrites of <BrainRegion>nucleus laminaris</BrainRegion>(NL) . We have begun to examine the molecular signals that influence segregation of inputs onto discrete regions of <BrainRegion>nucleus laminaris</BrainRegion>(NL) cells. We previously showed that the Eph receptor, EphA4, is expressed selectively in the <BrainRegion>dorsal nucleus laminaris</BrainRegion>(NL) neuropil from embryonic day (E) 9 to E11, when <BrainRegion>Nucleus magnocellularis</BrainRegion>(NM) axons grow into the <BrainRegion>nucleus laminaris</BrainRegion>(NL) neuropil. This asymmetric distribution suggests that EphA4 acts as a guidance molecule during binaural segregation. We report here on the developmental changes in the expression of two other Eph receptors, EphB2 and EphB5, and two ligands, ephrin-B1 and ephrin-B2, in the chick <BrainRegion>auditory brainstem</BrainRegion>. These proteins are expressed in the <BrainRegion>auditory nuclei</BrainRegion> during the maturation of the <BrainRegion>Nucleus magnocellularis</BrainRegion>(NM) - <BrainRegion>nucleus laminaris</BrainRegion>(NL) projection. EphB2, EphB5, and ephrin-B1 are expressed in <BrainRegion>dorsal and ventral nucleus laminaris</BrainRegion>(NL) neuropil and at the midline of the <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion> at E10-E12. At this age, ephrin-B2, a ligand for EphB receptors and for EphA4, is expressed in <BrainRegion>nucleus laminaris</BrainRegion>(NL) cell bodies and <BrainRegion>Nucleus magnocellularis</BrainRegion>(NM) - <BrainRegion>nucleus laminaris</BrainRegion>(NL) axons. The expression of these proteins diminishs in the posthatch ages examined. These results suggest that several members of the Eph family are involved in maturation of the nuclei and their projections. Moreover, ephrin-B2 in growing axons may interact with the asymmetrically expressed EphA4 during the establishment of binaural segregation.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Neuron-specific expression of a synaptotagmin gene in the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Interest in chordate evolution has emphasized a need for a better understanding of the comparative neuroanatomy of invertebrate deuterostomes. However, molecular and genetic approaches to neurobiological studies in these groups are hampered by a lack of neuron-specific molecular markers. A monoclonal antibody, 1E11, is neuron specific and is useful in identification of neural structures in larvae and adults of echinoderms, hemichordates, and urochordates. To identify a neuron-specific gene product, we have characterized the antigen recognized by 1E11. In immunoblots and immunoprecipitations of neural tissue from adult Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, 1E11 recognizes a 57-kDa band. Tandem mass spectrometry of trypsin digests of the 57-kDa band permitted peptide mass mapping and sequencing of five peptides. All of the sequenced peptides, and 12 additional mass-mapped peptides, are found within the open reading frame of a cDNA encoding synaptotagmin B (Sp-SynB). In situ RNA hybridizations with synaptotagmin B probes with S. purpuratus larvae reveal a pattern of expression that is similar to that revealed by the antibody 1E11. Antibodies produced against a bacterially expressed Sp-SynB protein recognize a 57-kDa protein and colocalize with 1E11. When a full-length Sp-SynB cDNA is expressed in chicken embryonic cells, the cells become immunoreactive to 1E11. We conclude that synaptotagmin B is a gene expressed in neurons that has conserved epitopes in other invertebrate deuterostomes.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Involvement of cyclin-dependent kinases in axotomy-induced <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> ganglion cell death.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>We have tested the role of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) in the type 3B death of axotomized retinal ganglion cells, by injecting intraocularly olomoucine, roscovitine, or butyrolactone I. Each of these inhibits CDK1, CDK2, and CDK5; CDK1 and CDK2 are involved in cell proliferation, whereas CDK5 is involved in neuronal differentiation. The inhibitors partially protected ganglion cells against the effects of axotomy. These agents may affect the ganglion cells directly, because CDK1, its regulatory subunit cyclin B1, and CDK5 were identified immunohistochemically in the perikarya of ganglion cells, and this was confirmed for CDK1 and CDK5 in Western blots of the ganglion cell layer. These blots showed an axotomy-induced phosphorylation of CDK5 occurring remarkably quickly (within 6 hours of axotomy) but little if any change in the phosphorylation state of CDK1. In addition, we studied the expression of proliferation markers, including proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and the synthesis of DNA, by immunohistochemical and autoradiographic methods. Normal or axotomized ganglion cells did not express proliferating cell nuclear antigen(PCNA) and did not synthesize DNA. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that axotomized ganglion cells may leave their quiescent state, our data show that they did not progress beyond the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Finally, in contrast to inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases(CDKs) , cell cycle blockers with different targets than cyclin-dependent kinases(CDKs) did not protect ganglion cells. Globally, our results suggest that axotomy-induced death of ganglion cells involves the activation of CDK1, CDK2, or CDK5 (most probably CDK5) but not the full cell cycle machinery.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Ultrastructural evidence that horizontal cell axon terminals are presynaptic in the human <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The organization of the rod spherule and of the horizontal cell axon terminals within the invagination of the rod spherule in the human <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> was examined in serial sections by electron microscopy. Twenty-one rod spherules were reconstructed in this study. Axon terminal processes of type I horizontal cells consistently make one or two small punctate synapses onto each rod spherule within the invagination. In addition, these axon terminal processes make distinct synapses upon rod bipolar dendrites outside the spherule before both processes enter the invagination. This is the first positive description of a synapse from a horizontal cell axon terminal process onto a photoreceptor terminal and the first identification of a synapse from a horizontal cell to a rod bipolar cell in the mammalian outer plexiform layer. We speculate that the axon terminal-to-rod synapse is responsible for feedback while the synapse upon the rod bipolar cell is feed-forward and serves to expand the receptive field of the rod bipolar cell beyond its dendritic field. Alternatively, the latter may contribute to a center-surround organization of the rod bipolar&apos;s receptive field.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Distribution of galanin-like immunoreactive elements in the brain of the adult lamprey Lampetra fluviatilis.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Galanin is a brain-gut peptide present in the central nervous system of vertebrates and invertebrates. The distribution of galanin-like immunoreactive perikarya and fibers in the brain of the river lamprey Lampetra fluviatilis (Agnatha) has been studied immunocytochemically by using antisera against rat and porcine galanin. Galanin-like immunoreactive perikarya were seen in the <BrainRegion>telencephalon</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>mediobasal diencephalon</BrainRegion>. In the <BrainRegion>telencephalon</BrainRegion>, they were present in the <BrainRegion>nucleus olfactorius anterior</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>nucleus basalis</BrainRegion>, and especially, in the <BrainRegion>nucleus commissurae anterioris</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>diencephalon</BrainRegion> contained most of the immunoreactive neurons. They were located in the <BrainRegion>nucleus commissurae praeinfundibularis</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>nucleus ventralis hypothalami</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>nucleus commissurae postinfundibularis</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>nucleus ventralis thalami</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>nucleus dorsalis thalami pars medius</BrainRegion>. Most of the galanin-like immunoreactive infundibular neurons showed apical processes contacting the <BrainRegion>cerebrospinal fluid</BrainRegion>. Immunoreactive fibers and terminals were widely distributed throughout the neuraxis. In the <BrainRegion>telencephalon</BrainRegion>, the richest galaninergic innervation was found in the <BrainRegion>nucleus olfactorius anterior</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>lobus subhippocampalis</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>corpus striatum</BrainRegion>, and around the <BrainRegion>nucleus septi</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>nucleus praeopticus</BrainRegion>. In the <BrainRegion>diencephalon</BrainRegion>, the highest density of galanin-like immunoreactive fibers was seen in the <BrainRegion>nucleus commissurae postopticae</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>nucleus commissurae praeinfundibularis</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>nucleus ventralis hypothalami</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>nucleus dorsalis hypothalami</BrainRegion>, and neurohypophysis. In the <BrainRegion>mesencephalon</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>rhombencephalon</BrainRegion>, the distribution of immunoreactive fibers was heterogeneous, being most pronounced in a region between the <BrainRegion>nucleus nervi oculomotorii</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>nucleus interpeduncularis mesencephali</BrainRegion>, in the <BrainRegion>nucleus isthmi</BrainRegion>, and in the <BrainRegion>raphe region</BrainRegion>. A subependymal plexus of immunoreactive fibers was found throughout the ventricular system. The distribution of immunoreactive neurons and fibers was similar to that of teleosts but different to those of other vertebrate groups. The possible hypophysiotropic and neuroregulatory roles of galanin are discussed.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>A morphological correlate of target recognition by regenerating motor axons in the cockroach.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>A specific cell recognition process during regeneration of severed axons of identified cockroach motor neurons eventually leads to the reformation of the original innervation pattern of target muscles in the leg. This occurs even though, at early times after nerve crush, the multiple branches of each regenerating axon grow into both appropriate and inappropriate muscles. In this study, we sought to examine whether there are any structural differences between regenerating axon branches in appropriate and inappropriate muscles that could lead to an understanding of why only those in inappropriate muscles are eliminated. A neuron subset-specific monoclonal antibody, NSS-2A, which labels the inhibitory motor neurons, was used to make their axon branches visible at various times after nerve crush. In inappropriate muscles, these axons grow primarily parallel to the muscle fibers and are later eliminated. In the appropriate muscles, these axon branches initially also grow parallel to the muscle fibers, but subsequently grow many interstitial collaterals. The formation of the collateral branches is a morphological correlate of the specific interaction of a neuron with its appropriate muscle. The simultaneous occurrence of axonal elimination and collateral sprouting supports the idea that the two processes are causally related, as suggested by the sibling neurite bias hypothesis.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Neuronal plasticity in the deafferented <BrainRegion>hypothalamic arcuate nucleus</BrainRegion> of adult female rats and its enhancement by treatment with estrogen.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The <BrainRegion>hypothalamic arcuate nucleus</BrainRegion> (ARCN) was examined ultrastructurally 3 or 21 days after complete deafferentation of the <BrainRegion>medial basal hypothalamus</BrainRegion> (MBH) in ovariectomized adult female rats. Axodendritic shaft (SHS) and spine synapses (SPS) were counted in a field of 18,000 mu m2 in the <BrainRegion>middle part of the arcuate nucleus</BrainRegion>(ARCN) in each brain. The mean numbers of SHS and synapses(SPS) at 3 or 21 days after deafferentation were reduced to about half of those in intact control animals. When the <BrainRegion>arcuate nucleus</BrainRegion>(ARCN) s of the ovariectomized <BrainRegion>medial basal hypothalamus</BrainRegion>(MBH) -island rats were examined 3 days after treatment with estradiol benzoate (EB, 2 mu g/day), the numbers of SHS and synapses(SPS) did not differ from those in ovariectomized <BrainRegion>medial basal hypothalamus</BrainRegion>(MBH) -island rats without estradiol benzoate(EB) treatment. However, estradiol benzoate(EB) treatment for 21 days produced a marked increase in the number of both SHS and synapses(SPS) in the ovariectomized <BrainRegion>medial basal hypothalamus</BrainRegion>(MBH) -island females, with the number of SHS in these females being restored to almost 75% of the intact level; the incidence of synapses(SPS) was also significantly greater than that in the intact control animals. In these estradiol benzoate(EB) -treated, ovariectomized <BrainRegion>medial basal hypothalamus</BrainRegion>(MBH) -island rats, double synapses (spine-spine and spine-shaft double synapses) were frequently observed. In ovariectomized females without <BrainRegion>medial basal hypothalamus</BrainRegion>(MBH) deafferentation, however, estrogen failed to increase the numbers of SHS, synapses(SPS) , and double synapses, which were almost comparable to those in intact and ovariectomized controls. These results suggest that estrogen has a facilitatory effect on SHS and synapses(SPS) formation in the deafferented <BrainRegion>arcuate nucleus</BrainRegion>(ARCN) , presumably stimulating not only axonal sprouting but also dendritic spine formation by intact <BrainRegion>arcuate</BrainRegion> neurons in the <BrainRegion>medial basal hypothalamus</BrainRegion>(MBH) island.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Organization of the spinal cord in four species of elasmobranch fish: cytoarchitecture and distribution of serotonin and selected neuropeptides.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>An analysis of Nissl stained sections of the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> taken from four species of elasmobranch showed that seven distinct cytoarchitectonic laminae are present. These laminae are compared with laminae described previously in the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> of other vertebrates. The distribution of immunoreactivity to serotonin, substance P, somatostatin, calcitonin gene-related peptide, neuropeptide Y, and bombesin was determined in the brown stringray (Dasyatis fluviorum), the eagle ray (Aetobatis narinari), the shovelnose ray (Rhinobatis battilum), and the black-tip shark (Carcharhinus melanopterus). In all species, dense immunoreactivity to most substances tested was found in the outer part of the <BrainRegion>substantia gelatinosa</BrainRegion>. Many fibres and varicosities immunoreactive to substance P, calcitonin gene-related peptide, and bombesin were found in this region and smaller numbers of fibres were found in the <BrainRegion>nucleus proprius</BrainRegion>. Immunoreactivity to somatostatin consisted of coarse fibre bundles that entered the <BrainRegion>dorsal horn at the nucleus proprius</BrainRegion> and radiated dorsally to the <BrainRegion>substantia gelatinosa</BrainRegion>. Axons and varicosities immunoreactive to serotonin and neuropeptide Y were found in all regions of the dorsal horn but were concentrated in the outer part of the <BrainRegion>substantia gelatinosa</BrainRegion>. The distribution of immunoreactivity to met-enkephalin in the shovelnose ray was concentrated in the lateral third of the <BrainRegion>substantia gelatinosa</BrainRegion> and to a lesser extent in the <BrainRegion>nucleus proprius</BrainRegion>. The distribution of these substances is compared with that described in other vertebrates. Although the sensory information reaching the elasmobranch <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> is limited, compared with that of mammalian species, the distribution of these neuroactive factors in the dorsal horn of the two groups is strikingly similar.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Structure and function relationship in the abdominal stretch receptor organs of the crayfish.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The structure/function relationship in the rapidly and slowly adapting stretch receptor organs of the crayfish (Astacus leptodactylus) was investigated using confocal microscopy and neuronal modeling methods. Both receptor muscles were single muscle fibers with structural properties closely related to the function of the receptors. Dendrites of the rapidly adapting neuron terminated in a common pile of nerve endings going in all directions. Dendrites of the slowly adapting neuron terminated in a characteristic T shape in multiple regions of the receptor muscle. The slowly adapting main dendrite, which was on average 2.1 times longer and 21% thinner than the rapidly adapting main dendrite, induced larger voltage attenuation. The somal surface area of the slowly adapting neuron was on average 51% larger than that of the rapidly adapting neuron. Variation in the neuronal geometry was greatest among the slowly adapting neurons. A computational model of a neuron pair demonstrated that the rapidly and the slowly adapting neurons attenuated the dendritic receptor potential like low-pass filters with cut-off frequencies at 100 and 20 Hz, respectively. Recurrent dendrites were observed mostly in the slowly adapting neurons. Voltage signals were calculated to be propagated 23% faster in the rapidly adapting axon, which is 51% thicker than the slowly adapting axon. The present findings support the idea that the morphology of the rapidly and the slowly adapting neurons evolved to optimally sense the dynamic and the static features of the mechanical stimulus, respectively.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Development of the projections from the <BrainRegion>dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>lateral suprasylvian visual area of cortex</BrainRegion> in the cat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>In the study reported in the preceding paper, we used retrograde labeling methods to show that the enhanced projection from the <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>posteromedial lateral suprasylvian (PMLS) visual area</BrainRegion> of <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion> that is present in adult cats following neonatal <BrainRegion>visual cortex</BrainRegion> damage arises at least partly from surviving neurons in the <BrainRegion>dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion> (LGN). In the C layers of the <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(LGN) , many more cells than normal are retrogradely labeled by horseradish peroxidase (HRP) injected into <BrainRegion>posteromedial lateral suprasylvian(PMLS) cortex</BrainRegion> ipsilateral to a <BrainRegion>visual cortex</BrainRegion> lesion. In addition, retrogradely labeled cells are found in the A layers, which normally have no projection to <BrainRegion>posteromedial lateral suprasylvian(PMLS) cortex</BrainRegion> in adult cats. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the mechanisms of this enhanced projection by examining the normal development of projections from the <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion>, especially the <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(LGN) , to <BrainRegion>posteromedial lateral suprasylvian(PMLS) cortex</BrainRegion>. Injections of horseradish peroxidase(HRP) were made into <BrainRegion>posteromedial lateral suprasylvian(PMLS) cortex</BrainRegion> on the day of birth or at 1, 2, 4, or 8 weeks of age. Retrogradely labeled neurons were present in the <BrainRegion>lateral posterior nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>posterior nucleus of Rioch</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>pulvinar</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>medial interlaminar nucleus</BrainRegion>, as well as in the <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(LGN) , at all ages studied. Within the <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(LGN) of the youngest kittens, a small number of retrogradely labeled cells was present in the interlaminar zones and among the cells in the A layers that border these zones. Such labeled cells were virtually absent by 8 weeks of age, and they are not found in normal adult cats. Sparse retrograde labeling of C-layer neurons also was present in newborn kittens.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Pretectal</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>brain stem</BrainRegion> projections of the <BrainRegion>medial terminal nucleus</BrainRegion> of the accessory optic system of the rabbit and rat as studied by anterograde and retrograde neuronal tracing methods.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The projections of the <BrainRegion>medial terminal nucleus</BrainRegion> (MTN) of the accessory optic system have been studied in the rabbit and rat following injection of 3H-leucine or 3H-leucine/3H-proline into the <BrainRegion>medial terminal nucleus</BrainRegion>(MTN) and the charting of the course and terminal distribution of the medial terminal nucleus(MTN) efferents. The projections of the <BrainRegion>medial terminal nucleus</BrainRegion>(MTN) , as demonstrated autoradiographically, have been confirmed in retrograde transport studies in which horseradish peroxidase (HRP) has been injected into nuclei shown in the autoradiographic series to contain fields of terminal axons. The following projections of the <BrainRegion>medial terminal nucleus</BrainRegion>(MTN) have been identified in the rabbit and rat. The largest projection is to the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral nucleus of the optic tract</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>dorsal terminal nucleus</BrainRegion> (DTN) of the accessory optic system. Labeled axons course through the midbrain <BrainRegion>reticular formation</BrainRegion> and the superior fasiculus, posterior fibers of the accessory optic system, to reach the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the optic tract</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>dorsal terminal nucleus</BrainRegion>(DTN) in both rabbit and rat. Axons also run forward to traverse the <BrainRegion>lateral thalamus</BrainRegion> and to distribute to rostral portions of the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the optic tract</BrainRegion> in rat only. A second, large projection is to the contralateral dorsolateral portion of the <BrainRegion>nucleus parabrachialis pigmentosus</BrainRegion> of the <BrainRegion>ventral tegmental area</BrainRegion> together with an adjacent segment of the midbrain <BrainRegion>reticular formation</BrainRegion>. The patchy terminal field observed has been named the <BrainRegion>visual tegmental relay zone</BrainRegion> (VTRZ). This fiber projection courses within the <BrainRegion>posterior commissure</BrainRegion> and along its path to the <BrainRegion>visual tegmental relay zone</BrainRegion>(VTRZ) , provides terminals to the <BrainRegion>interstitial nucleus of Cajal</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>nucleus of Darkschewitsch</BrainRegion>, both bilaterally. A third, <BrainRegion>large medial terminal nucleus</BrainRegion>(MTN) projection distributes ipsilaterally to the <BrainRegion>deep mesencephalic nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>pars medialis</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>oral pontine reticular formation</BrainRegion>. Further, this projection also supplies input to the <BrainRegion>medial nucleus of the periaqueductal gray matter</BrainRegion>, bilaterally in the rabbit and rat, and in the rabbit also to the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral superior and lateral vestibular nuclei</BrainRegion>. A fourth projection crosses the midline and courses caudally to reach, contralaterally, the <BrainRegion>dorsolateral division of the basilar pontine complex</BrainRegion> and the above <BrainRegion>nuclei of the vestibular complex</BrainRegion>. A fifth projection of the <BrainRegion>medial terminal nucleus</BrainRegion>(MTN) utilizes the medial longitudinal fasciiculus to reach the <BrainRegion>rostral medulla</BrainRegion>, in which its axons distribute ispilaterally to the dorsal cap, its ventrolateral outgrowth, and the <BrainRegion>beta nucleus of the inferior olivary complex</BrainRegion>. There is also a contralateral contingent of this projection that leaves the medial longitudinal fasciculus to innervate a small rostral segment of the contralateral dorsal cap.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<AbstractText>The projections of the <BrainRegion>cerebral cortex</BrainRegion> upon the <BrainRegion>septum</BrainRegion> in water snakes (Natrix sipedon) and garter snakes. (Thamnophis sirtalis) were studied with the Fink-Heimer degeneration techniques. Two <BrainRegion>cortical areas</BrainRegion> send major projections to the <BrainRegion>septum</BrainRegion>. <BrainRegion>Medial cortex</BrainRegion> projects bilaterally to the <BrainRegion>dorsal portion of the precommissural septum</BrainRegion> along its full rostrocaudal extent. The ipsilateral projection is more massive than the contralateral one. <BrainRegion>Dorsal cortex</BrainRegion> projects ipsilaterally to a column within the <BrainRegion>septum</BrainRegion> which is present dorsally, caudal to the level of the <BrainRegion>anterior commissure</BrainRegion>, but shifts ventrally as the <BrainRegion>septum</BrainRegion> is followed rostrally. <BrainRegion>Lateral cortex</BrainRegion> may send a sparse projection to the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral ventral septum</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>The <BrainRegion>substantia nigra</BrainRegion> of the rat: a Golgi study.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Three variants of the Golgi method were employed to examine the cell types, their dendritic fields and organization and axonal trajectories within the <BrainRegion>substantia nigra</BrainRegion> of albino and hooded rats. In both sagittal and coronal sections, large, medium and small neurons were classified on the basis of soma size, extent of dendritic fileds and dendritic caliber. In general nigral cells have three to five primary dendrites that branch relatively infrequently. Some dendrites of all cell types have thinly scattered spines or varicosities. Small cells, found in all areas of the nucleus, have thin dendrites and small, nondirectional dendritic fields. These are considered to be interneurons. The medium cells found in <BrainRegion>pars compacta</BrainRegion>, presumed to be the dopaminergic cells of the nigroneostriatal pathway, send long dendrites into <BrainRegion>pars reticulata</BrainRegion> perpendicular to the course of <BrainRegion>pars compacta</BrainRegion>. In addition, these cells have a number of dendrites which remain in <BrainRegion>pars compacta</BrainRegion>. These cells have axons that run medio-dorsally. No axon collaterals were detected. Both large and medium cells are found in <BrainRegion>pars reticulata</BrainRegion>. Cells in the <BrainRegion>dorso-medial aspect of pars reticulata</BrainRegion> orient rostro-caudally and roughly perpendicular to the course of <BrainRegion>pars compacta</BrainRegion>, while cells in the peripeduncular area show a strict orientation which is parallel to the <BrainRegion>crus cerebri</BrainRegion>. Some <BrainRegion>pars reticulata</BrainRegion> cells emit axon collaterals while others remain unbranced for their observable lenght. Both large and medium cells are also seen in <BrainRegion>pars lateralis</BrainRegion>. These cells send long dendrites ventrally into <BrainRegion>pars reticulata</BrainRegion> where they run parallel to the <BrainRegion>crus cerebri</BrainRegion>, while some shorter dendrites remain in <BrainRegion>pars lateralis</BrainRegion>. In total, the <BrainRegion>substantia nigra</BrainRegion> appears to have a layered organization: the superior layer is the cellular <BrainRegion>pars compacta</BrainRegion>, the second is the <BrainRegion>dorso-medial area of pars reticulata</BrainRegion> where both <BrainRegion>pars compacta</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>pars reticulata</BrainRegion> dendrites run rostro-caudally and dorso-ventrally and the third layer is the <BrainRegion>peripeduncular region</BrainRegion> where dendrites from all areas run parallel to the <BrainRegion>crus cerebri</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Zonal organization of the mouse <BrainRegion>flocculus</BrainRegion>: physiology, input, and output.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The zones of the <BrainRegion>flocculus</BrainRegion> have been mapped in many species with a noticeable exception, the mouse. Here, the functional map of the mouse was constructed via extracellular recordings followed by tracer injections of biotinylated-dextran-amine and immunohistochemistry for heat-shock protein-25. Zones were identified based on the Purkinje cell complex spike modulation occurring in response to optokinetic stimulation. In zones 1 and 3 Purkinje cells responded best to rotation about a horizontal axis oriented at 135 degrees ipsilateral azimuth, whereas in zones 2 and 4 they responded best to rotation about the vertical axis. The tracing experiments showed that Purkinje cells of zone 1 projected to the <BrainRegion>parvicellular part of lateral cerebellar nucleus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>superior vestibular nucleus</BrainRegion>, while Purkinje cells of zone 3 projected to group Y and the <BrainRegion>superior vestibular nucleus</BrainRegion>. Purkinje cells of zones 2 and 4 projected to the <BrainRegion>magnocellular and parvicellular parts of the medial vestibular nucleus</BrainRegion>, while some also innervated the <BrainRegion>lateral vestibular nucleus</BrainRegion> or <BrainRegion>nucleus prepositus hypoglossi</BrainRegion>. The climbing fiber inputs to Purkinje cells in zones 1 and 3 were derived from neurons in the ventrolateral outgrowth of the <BrainRegion>contralateral inferior olive</BrainRegion>, whereas those in zones 2 and 4 were derived from the <BrainRegion>contralateral caudal dorsal cap</BrainRegion>. Purkinje cells in zones 1 and 2, but not in zones 3 and 4, were positively labeled for heat-shock protein-25. The present study illustrates that Purkinje cells in the murine <BrainRegion>flocculus</BrainRegion> are organized in discrete zones with specific functions, specific input - output relations, and a specific histochemical signature.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Complementary and layered expression of Ephs and ephrins in developing mouse <BrainRegion>inner ear</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The distributions of the Eph-class receptors EphA4 and EphB1, and their ligands ephrin-A2, ephrin-B1, and ephrin-B2, were analysed by immunostaining in the mouse <BrainRegion>inner ear</BrainRegion>. Complementary patterns of EphA4 and its potential ligand ephrin-A2 were found, with ephrin-A2 in many of the structures lining the <BrainRegion>cochlear duct</BrainRegion> and within the <BrainRegion>cochlear nerve</BrainRegion> cells, and EphA4 in the deeper structures underlying the <BrainRegion>cochlear duct</BrainRegion> and in the cells lining the nerve pathway. EphB1 and its potential ligands ephrin-B1 and ephrin-B2 showed a segregated layered expression in the lateral wall of the <BrainRegion>cochlear duct</BrainRegion> (the external sulcus), which together with EphA4 expressed in the area, form a four-layered structure with an alternating pattern of receptors and ligands in the different layers. This arrangement gives the potential for different bidirectional Eph-mediated interactions between each of the layers. The results suggest that the Eph system in the <BrainRegion>cochlea</BrainRegion> may have a role in maintaining cell segregation during phases of <BrainRegion>cochlear</BrainRegion> development.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Quantitative electron microscopic analysis of the <BrainRegion>optic nerve</BrainRegion> of the turtle, Pseudemys.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>It is estimated by means of electron microscopy that the <BrainRegion>optic nerve</BrainRegion> of the turtle Pseudemys scripta elegans contains 394,900 fibers of which approximately 80% are myelinated. The total fiber count agrees well with counts obtained from electron microscopic studies on other turtle species. There are, however, differences among these species in the percentage of myelinated fibers in the <BrainRegion>optic nerve</BrainRegion>. The axon diameter distribution of the myelinated fibers (excluding myelin) has a mode at 0.87 micrometer while that of the unmyelinated fibers has a mode at 0.42 micrometer. Both distributions are unimodal and are of a similar form in all areas of the nerve sampled. The total fiber count reported here agrees well with previous reports of ganglion cell counts in Pseudemys and the characteristics of the fiber distributions are comparable to those reported for nonreptilian vertebrates.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Naturally occurring cell death and migration of microglial precursors in the quail <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> during normal development.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>We compared chronotopographical patterns of distribution of naturally occurring neuronal death in the ganglion cell layer (GCL) and the inner nuclear layer (INL) with patterns of tangential and radial migration of microglial precursors during quail <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> development. Apoptotic cells were identified by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end labeling technique, and microglial precursors were identified by immunocytochemistry with an antibody recognizing quail microglial cells (QH1 antibody). Apoptotic cells were first detectable in the ganglion cell layer(GCL) at the seventh day of incubation (E7), were most abundant at E10, and were absent after E13. In the inner nuclear layer(INL) , apoptotic cells first appeared at E7, were most abundant at E12, and disappeared entirely after the third posthatching day (P3). In both retinal layers, cell death first appeared in a small central area of the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> and subsequently spread along three gradients: central-to-peripheral, temporal-to-nasal, and dorsal-to-ventral. The chronology of tangential (between E7 and E16) and radial migration (between E8 and P3) of microglial precursors was highly coincident with that of cell death in the ganglion cell layer(GCL) and inner nuclear layer(INL) . Comparison of the chronotopographical pattern of distribution of apoptotic nuclei in the ganglion cell layer(GCL) with the patterns of tangential and radial migration of microglial precursors neither supported nor refuted the hypothesis that ganglion cell death is the stimulus that triggers the entry and migration of microglial precursors in the developing <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>. However, microglial cells in most of the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> traversed the inner nuclear layer(INL) only after cell death had ceased in this layer, suggesting that cell death in the inner nuclear layer(INL) does not attract microglial precursors migrating radially. Dead cell debris in this layer was phagocytosed by Müller cells, whereas migrating microglial cells were seen phagocytosing apoptotic bodies in the nerve fiber layer and ganglion cell layer(GCL) but not in the inner nuclear layer(INL) .</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Fiber analysis of the feline inferior cardiac sympathetic nerve.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The left inferior cardiac nerves of nine adult cats were examined with the electron microscope. Electrical recordings were also made from four of these nerves. Most of the nerves contained between 25,000 and 40,000 unmyelinated fibers and 30 to 150 myelinated fibers. The diameters of the unmyelinated fibers ranged from 0.1 mu to 1.8 mu with mean diameters ranging from 0.47 to 0.78 mu in the various nerves. The myelinated fibers ranged in diameter from 1 mu to 9 mu with a mean difference of approximately 3 mu. Electrical recordings showed two peaks in both the C fiber and the Adelta fiber compound action potentials. Conduction velocities of the two C fiber peaks were approximately 0.7 and 0.9 m/sec. The two groups of A delta fibers had conduction velocities of approximately 7 and 16 m/sec.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Embryonic and postembryonic morphogenesis of a grasshopper interneuron.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The object of this study was to describe the embryonic and postembryonic morphogenesis of a grasshopper interneuron in order to determine how, and when, this cell comes to assume its mature form. DCMD is an intensively investigated interneuron whose morphology, input and output physiology, and role in behavior are relatively well-known in the adult. We examined the morphology of DCMD in the brain at each stage of its development with silver-intensified cobalt-fills. It arises at 40 +/- 4% of embryogenesis and is probably one of the early progeny from its stem cell. In the ensuing 40% of development, its brain arborization grows quite directly into its mature form. Branches appear first and are always longest and densest in the brain region where the adult arborization is found. Thus, the adult form arises by initially directed growth and not by secondary selection of branches from a diffuse or overgrown arborization. Restricted secondary branch loss of lateral filopodia and probably of a few early branches does occur. Embryonic and postembryonic development of the cell are distinctly different. Embryogenesis is the period of morphological differentiation as indicated by the growth and shaping of the brain and also thoracic (axonal) arborizations, the appearance of cytological specializations, and the logarithmic growth of the neurite and soma. The brain arborization has its mature form, although not size, by the completion of embryogenesis. Postembryonic development is a period of substantial, but primarily allometric, growth. The soma and neurite grow linearly (with time), and the arborization grows in proportion to brain size.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Y <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> terminals contact interneurons in the cat <BrainRegion>dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>One of the largest influences on <BrainRegion>dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion> (dLGN) activity comes from interneurons, which use the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). It is well established that X <BrainRegion>retinogeniculate</BrainRegion> terminals contact interneurons and thalamocortical cells in complex synaptic arrangements known as glomeruli. However, there is little anatomical evidence for the involvement of <BrainRegion>dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(dLGN) interneurons in the Y pathway. To determine whether Y <BrainRegion>retinogeniculate</BrainRegion> axons contact interneurons, we injected the <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion> (SC) with biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) to backfill <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> axons, which also project to the <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion>(SC) . Within the A lamina of the <BrainRegion>dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(dLGN) , this biotinylated dextran amine(BDA) labeling allowed us to distinguish Y <BrainRegion>retinogeniculate</BrainRegion> axons from X <BrainRegion>retinogeniculate</BrainRegion> axons, which do not project to the <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion>(SC) . In biotinylated dextran amine(BDA) -labeled tissue prepared for electron microscopic analysis, we subsequently used postembedding immunocytochemical staining for gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) to distinguish interneurons from thalamocortical cells. We found that the majority of profiles postsynaptic to Y <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> axons were gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) -negative dendrites of thalamocortical cells (117/200 or 58.5%). The remainder (83/200 or 41.5%) were gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) -positive dendrites, many of which contained vesicles (59/200 or 29.5%). Thus, Y <BrainRegion>retinogeniculate</BrainRegion> axons do contact interneurons. However, these contacts differed from X <BrainRegion>retinogeniculate</BrainRegion> axons, in that triadic arrangements were rare. This indicates that the X and Y pathways participate in unique circuitries but that interneurons are involved in the modulation of both pathways.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Anatomical and physiological studies of the gray matter surrounding the <BrainRegion>spinal cord central canal</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Recent histochemical evidence suggests that neurons in the gray matter surrounding the <BrainRegion>central canal</BrainRegion> may play a role in nociception. We attempted to evaluate this possibility by studying the response properties and ascending projections of these cells in the rat. In the first series of experiments, the ascending projections of neurons around the <BrainRegion>central canal</BrainRegion> were studied by the method of retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase (HRP). Predominantly contralateral labeling of neurons around the <BrainRegion>central canal</BrainRegion> appeared after horseradish peroxidase(HRP) injections into the <BrainRegion>paramedian medullary</BrainRegion> or <BrainRegion>pontine reticular formation</BrainRegion> in intact or cerebellectomized animals. Far fewer cells were labeled by injections into the <BrainRegion>lateral medulla</BrainRegion> and/or <BrainRegion>pons</BrainRegion>. A small number of cells was retrogradely labeled by horseradish peroxidase(HRP) injections into the vermal and <BrainRegion>intermediate regions of the cerebellum</BrainRegion> or the <BrainRegion>periaqueductal gray matter</BrainRegion>. Injections into other <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion> areas outside of the <BrainRegion>reticular formation</BrainRegion> also failed to label large numbers of neurons around the <BrainRegion>centra canal</BrainRegion>. In a second set of experiments, we recorded extracellular unitary activity from the lumbar enlargement in spinalized, decerebrate, unanesthetized rats. Thirteen units were functionally characterized and histologically localized within 300 micrometers of the <BrainRegion>central canal</BrainRegion>. All of the units identified responded exclusively to noxious stimuli applied within highly circumscribed receptive fields. Thus, neurons around the <BrainRegion>central canal</BrainRegion> contribute strongly to long ascending <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> projections. Physiologically, neurons found within this region are reminiscent of the noxious-specific cells in the outer most layers of the dorsal horn.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>In situ hybridization analysis of the distribution of neurokinin-3 mRNA in the rat central nervous system.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The tachykinin family of neuropeptides, which includes substance P, neurokinin A, and neurokinin B, have three distinct receptors: NK-1, NK-2, and NK-3. With the cloning of the rat NK-3 cDNA, it is now possible to evaluate the distribution of NK-3 mRNA in the rat brain. Female rat brains were sectioned and hybridized with a riboprobe complimentary to NK-3 mRNA. The results of these studies revealed an extensive distribution of NK-3 mRNA throughout the rostral-caudal extent of the brain, <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>, and retina. In agreement with previous binding studies, we observed NK-3 mRNA in the <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>amygdala</BrainRegion>, th<BrainRegion>e hippocampus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>medial habenula</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>zona incerta</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei of the hypothalamus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>substantia nigra</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>ventral tegmental area</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>interpeduncular nucleus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>raphe nuclei</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>dorsal tegmental nucleus</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion>. In contrast with binding data, only a few NK-3 mRNA cells were detected in the <BrainRegion>striatum</BrainRegion>. In addition, the present study detected NK-3 mRNA in the <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>dentate gyrus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>subiculum</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>medial septum</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>diagonal band of Broca</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>ventral pallidum</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>globus pallidus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>bed nucleus of the stria terminalis</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>arcuate</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>premammillary and mammillary nuclei</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>dorsal and lateral regions of the posterior hypothalamus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>central gray</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>cerebellum</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>parabrachial nuclei</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the spinal trigeminal tract</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>dorsal horn of the spinal cord</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>. The results of these in situ hybridization histochemical studies have provided detailed and novel information about the distribution of NK-3 mRNA and have elucidated the putative sites of neurokinin B action in the rat central nervous system.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Studies of the principal sensory and <BrainRegion>spinal trigeminal nuclei</BrainRegion> of the rat: projections to the <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>inferior olive</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>cerebellum</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>We have analyzed the connections between the <BrainRegion>sensory trigeminal nuclei</BrainRegion> and two major <BrainRegion>sensorimotor areas</BrainRegion> (i.e., the <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>crura I and II of the cerebellar cortex</BrainRegion>) in which tactile input from peri-oral and other facial regions is a prominent feature. Following injections of horseradish peroxidase into the <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion>, retrogradely labeled cells occupy the <BrainRegion>ventral one-third of the contralateral principal sensory and spinal trigeminal nucleus</BrainRegion>; trigeminocollicular neurons are especially numerous within the <BrainRegion>subnucleus interpolaris</BrainRegion> (Svi). Injections of either 3H-proline or horseradish peroxidase (HRP) into the <BrainRegion>Svi</BrainRegion> reveal that trigeminocollicular axons reach the rostral two-thirds to three-quarters of the <BrainRegion>contralateral superior colliculus</BrainRegion>, where they distribute in a nonuniform, patchy manner within layers IV-VI. In addition to demonstrating the trigeminocollicular projection, anterograde and retrograde transport studies of the <BrainRegion>Svi</BrainRegion> also reveal a trigeminoolivary projection which terminates primarily within the <BrainRegion>contralateral rostral dorsal accessory</BrainRegion> (DAO) and adjacent <BrainRegion>principal (PO) olives</BrainRegion>; some of the <BrainRegion>Svi</BrainRegion> neurons innervate both the <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>dorsal accessory(DAO) -PO</BrainRegion> via axon collaterals. Data from a final set of retrograde tracing experiments show that the <BrainRegion>trigeminorecipient zone of the dorsal accessory(DAO) -PO</BrainRegion> contains neurons which project to <BrainRegion>crura I and/or II of the cerebellar cortex</BrainRegion>. Of the various submodalities conveyed by the trigeminal system, it is likely that the <BrainRegion>trigeminal</BrainRegion> connections we have demonstrated are carrying tactile information. This is indicated by the fact that responses to tactile stimulation of the face have been reported for cells in (1) the deeper <BrainRegion>collicular</BrainRegion> layers, (2) the trigeminorecipient zone of the <BrainRegion>dorsal accessory(DAO) -PO</BrainRegion>, and (3) <BrainRegion>cerebellar</BrainRegion> targets of this zone, <BrainRegion>crura I and II</BrainRegion>. All data are discussed in the context of the anatomical and physiological literature.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

In this study on locusts, crickets, and cockroaches, we demonstrate 1) that related species can differ considerably in the fixation sensitivity of putatively nitric oxide synthase(NOS) -related NADPH diaphorase(NADPHd) ; and 2) that prolonged fixation can induce NADPH diaphorase(NADPHd) activity in cells that are diaphorase negative under mild fixation regimes. These two phenomena reconcile previous, contradictory reports on the distribution of NADPH diaphorase(NADPHd) in locusts and crickets. In locusts, neuronal NADPH diaphorase(NADPHd) is found exclusively in interneurones. The projection neuropiles of the exteroceptors contain a dense NADPH diaphorase(NADPHd) -positive fibre meshwork, but sensory afferents do not stain. In crickets, staining has been reported in sensory afferents, in motor neurones and dorsal unpaired median (DUM) neurones, and in a non-fibrous distribution throughout the sensory neuropiles. We demonstrate that this widespread, non-selective staining is induced by strong formaldehyde fixation. Weak fixation resulted in a highly selective labelling of a few individual interneurones and of a fibre meshwork in the projection neuropiles of the exteroceptive afferents. Staining was absent in the afferents themselves, in motor neurones, and in efferent dorsal unpaired median(DUM) neurones. Thus, after weak fixation, the staining pattern closely matched that in the locust. The similar distribution of putatively nitric oxide synthase(NOS) -related NADPH diaphorase(NADPHd) in the thoracic nervous systems of orthopteroid insects suggests a species-independent role for nitric oxide in the processing of mechanosensory information. Histopharmacological techniques such as permanganate oxidation, or incubation in the nitric oxide synthase(NOS) inhibitors methylene blue or dichlorophenolindophenol, did not allow discrimination between the selective and the fixation-induced staining. The species-specific impact of different fixation regimes may necessitate reconsideration of results obtained in other cross-species comparisons.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Projection of individual axons from the <BrainRegion>pretectum</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>dorsal lateral geniculate complex</BrainRegion> in the cat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The <BrainRegion>dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion> of the <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion> transmits visual signals from the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion>. Within the <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>, the ascending visual signals are modified by the actions of a number of afferent pathways. One such projection originates in the <BrainRegion>pretectum</BrainRegion> and appears to be active in association with oculomotor activity. Much remains unknown about the pretectal-geniculate projection. Our purpose was to examine for the first time individual axon arbors from the <BrainRegion>pretectum</BrainRegion> that project to the <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>, describing their topography and nuclear and laminar targets. We made injections of the anterograde tracer Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin into the cat <BrainRegion>pretectum</BrainRegion>, targeting the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the optic tract</BrainRegion>. Serial 40 microns coronal sections were processed by using immunohistochemistry to reveal labeled axons that were then serially reconstructed using light microscopy. Pretectal-geniculate axons appeared morphologically heterogeneous in terms of swelling size, branching patterns, and laminar target. Most axons innervated the <BrainRegion>geniculate</BrainRegion> A laminae. A separate, smaller population innervated the C laminae. All axons exhibited substantially greater spread medial-laterally than rostral-caudally in the <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>, displaying a topographical organization for visual field elevation, but not azimuth. Many <BrainRegion>pretectal</BrainRegion> axons that projected to the <BrainRegion>LGN</BrainRegion> also innervated adjacent structures, including the <BrainRegion>medial interlaminar nucleus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>perigeniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>, and/or the <BrainRegion>pulvinar</BrainRegion>. These results indicate that the projection from the <BrainRegion>pretectum</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion> is heterogeneous, is semitopographical, and may coordinate neural activity in the <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion> and in neighboring <BrainRegion>visual thalamic structures</BrainRegion> in association with oculomotor events.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Plasticity of the <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> dentition representation after tooth extraction in naked mole-rats.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Naked mole-rats (Heterocephalus glaber) have a large <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> representation of their behaviorally important front teeth, accounting for 30% of <BrainRegion>primary somatosensory cortex</BrainRegion> (SI). Here we investigated the plasticity of this dental representation after the extraction of a single lower tooth. The representation of the contralateral lower incisor normally accounts for approximately 15% of <BrainRegion>somatosensory cortex</BrainRegion> in mole-rats. In five mole-rats the lower right incisor was extracted on either postnatal day 7 or 21. After 5-8 months the deprived tooth zone in S1 was investigated with multiunit microelectrode recordings. The results revealed a dramatic reorganization of the orofacial representation in <BrainRegion>SI</BrainRegion>. Neurons in the <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> lower tooth representation were responsive to tactile inputs from surrounding orofacial structures, including the contralateral upper incisor, ipsilateral lower incisor, tongue, chin, gums, and buccal pad. Neurons in the former lower tooth zone had complex receptive fields that often encompassed multiple sensory surfaces surrounding the extracted tooth in the periphery. These results suggest that the representation of the dentition in mammals is capable of significant reorganization after the loss of sensory inputs from the teeth. These data parallel findings in the somatosensory hand area of primates after deafferentation where <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion> can become activated by a mixture of widely spaced surrounding sensory surfaces (e.g., chin and upper arm).</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Synaptic connections between identified neuron types in the <BrainRegion>antennal lobe</BrainRegion> glomeruli of the cockroach, Periplaneta americana: I. Uniglomerular projection neurons.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>A combination of three different labels was used to demonstrate synapses between three types of neurons within the glomeruli: 1) antennal receptor cells, 2) gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-immunoreactive neurons, and 3) uniglomerular projection neurons. Receptor cell axons were experimentally severed and caused to degenerate; uniglomerular projection neurons, a subgroup of glomerular output neurons, were labeled by intracellular horseradish peroxidase (HRP) injection and gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) -containing neurons by postembedding immunogold staining. The following synaptic connections were identified: 1) Receptor cell axons form monosynaptic contacts in a dyadic fashion onto a dendritic process of a uniglomerular projection neuron and in addition onto a gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) -immunoreactive neuron. 2) Receptor cell axons form polysynaptic connections with dendrites of uniglomerular projection neurons via gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) -immunoreactive neurons. 3) gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) -immunoreactive neurons form dyadic output synapses onto receptor cell axons and in addition onto projection neuron dendrites. These findings provide further evidence that signal transfer from receptor cells onto uniglomerular projection neurons is mediated by two different paths: first, a monosynaptic and presumably excitatory route and, second, an inhibitory polysynaptic route via gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) ergic, most likely multiglomerular interneurons. The output synapses of gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) -immunoreactive neurons onto both receptor cells and uniglomerular projection neurons are assumed to exert control functions in regulating the neuronal activity within the glomeruli.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Descending <BrainRegion>supraspinal</BrainRegion> pathways in amphibians. II. Distribution and origin of the catecholaminergic innervation of the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Immunohistochemical studies with antibodies against tyrosine hydroxylase, dopamine, and noradrenaline have revealed that the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> of anuran, urodele, and gymnophionan (apodan) amphibians is abundantly innervated by catecholaminergic (CA) fibers and terminals. Because intraspinal cells occur in all three orders of amphibians catecholaminergic(CA) , it is unclear to what extent the catecholaminergic(CA) innervation of the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> is of supraspinal origin. In a previous study, we showed that many cell groups throughout the <BrainRegion>forebrain</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion> project to the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> of two anurans (the green frog, Rana perezi, and the clawed toad, Xenopus laevis), a urodele (the Iberian ribbed newt, Pleurodeles waltl), and a gymnophionan (the Mexican caecilian, Dermophis mexicanus). To determine the exact site of origin of the supraspinal catecholaminergic(CA) innervation of the amphibian <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>, retrograde tracing techniques were combined with immunohistochemistry for tyrosine hydroxylase in the same sections. The double-labeling experiments demonstrated that four brain centers provide catecholaminergic(CA) innervation to the amphibian <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>: 1.) the ventrolateral component of the <BrainRegion>posterior tubercle in the mammillary region</BrainRegion>, 2.) the <BrainRegion>periventricular nucleus of the zona incerta in the ventral thalamus</BrainRegion>, 3.) the <BrainRegion>locus coeruleus</BrainRegion>, and 4.) the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion>. This pattern holds for all three orders of amphibians, except for the catecholaminergic(CA) projection from the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion> in gymnophionans. There are differences in the strength of the projections (based on the number of double-labeled cells), but in general, <BrainRegion>spinal</BrainRegion> functions in amphibians are controlled by catecholaminergic(CA) innervation from brain centers that can easily be compared with their counterparts in amniotes. The organization of the catecholaminergic(CA) input to the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> of amphibians is largely similar to that described for mammals. Nevertheless, by using a segmental approach of the CNS, a remarkable difference was observed with respect to the <BrainRegion>diencephalic</BrainRegion> catecholaminergic(CA) projections.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Topography of <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> representation in the rabbit <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion>: an experimental study using transneuronal and retrograde tracing techniques.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> representation of the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> in rabbits was studied autoradiographically using transneuronal transport of tritiated proline and tritiated fucose. Injection of one eye produced <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> labelling on both sides. There was no indication of ocular dominance columns. On the contralateral side, the labelling was found in <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> layers II-IV, and partly also in layer VI of <BrainRegion>area striata</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>caudal part of area peristriata</BrainRegion>, and in layer IV of most of <BrainRegion>area occipitalis</BrainRegion>. In addition, there was a patch of labelling in layers II-IV of the <BrainRegion>temporal cortex</BrainRegion>. On the ipsilateral side, the labelling was restricted to layer IV in a strip of <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion> comprising <BrainRegion>area striata</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>area occipitalis</BrainRegion> along their common border. The <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> labelling in <BrainRegion>area striata and occipitalis</BrainRegion> was interpreted as evidence for a direct geniculo-cortical projection. This was confirmed by demonstration of retrogrately labelled nerve cells in the <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion> produced by small injections of horseradish peroxidase into <BrainRegion>area occipitalis</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>area striata</BrainRegion>. In experiments with intraocular injections of tritiated adenosine, transneuronal cortical labelling was much weaker and more diffuse. In addition to the neuropil, nerve cell bodies and glial cells were also labelled.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Complementary expression of parvalbumin and calbindin D-28k delineates subdivisions of the rabbit <BrainRegion>medial geniculate body</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The complementary pattern of immunohistochemical staining for the calcium-binding proteins parvalbumin (PV) and calbindin D-28k (CB) was used to delineate four major subdivisions of the rabbit <BrainRegion>medial geniculate body</BrainRegion> (MGB). parvalbumin(PV) immunoreactivity predominates in the ventral and medial divisions, whereas calbindin D-28k(CB) -immunoreactive cells characterize the dorsal and internal divisions. The <BrainRegion>ventral nucleus</BrainRegion> is strongly parvalbumin(PV) + due to dense neuropil labeling and moderately labeled somata. The <BrainRegion>medial nucleus</BrainRegion> contains both medium-sized and large parvalbumin(PV) + somata, as well as thick parvalbumin(PV) + axons and terminals. The wedge-shaped internal nucleus composed of densely labeled calbindin D-28k(CB) + cells, separates the <BrainRegion>dorsal and ventral nuclei</BrainRegion> rostrally, and expands caudally to encapsulate the <BrainRegion>posterior MGV</BrainRegion>. Large multipolar calbindin D-28k(CB) + neurons with radiate dendrites characterize the <BrainRegion>dorsal nucleus</BrainRegion>. The differential expression of parvalbumin(PV) and calbindin D-28k(CB) also distinguishes the <BrainRegion>deep dorsal and superficial dorsal subnuclei</BrainRegion> in the dorsal division and a ventrolateral component in the ventral division. A comparison with studies of <BrainRegion>medial geniculate body</BrainRegion>(MGB) connectivity in a variety of species suggests that parvalbumin(PV) immunoreactivity is highest in subdivisions that receive a substantial input from the <BrainRegion>central nucleus of the inferior colliculus</BrainRegion> and that project to <BrainRegion>primary auditory cortex</BrainRegion>. In contrast, calbindin D-28k(CB) immunoreactivity characterizes nuclei that receive input primarily from other sources, such as the <BrainRegion>paracentral nuclei of the inferior colliculus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>lateral tegmentum</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>, and that project to <BrainRegion>secondary auditory areas</BrainRegion>. The ability of calcium-binding protein immunohistochemistry to delineate neuronal compartments across indistinct cytoarchitectonic borders makes it a powerful tool for guiding future connectional and physiological studies of the <BrainRegion>medial geniculate body</BrainRegion>(MGB) .</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Number, origins, and chemical types of rat <BrainRegion>pallidostriatal</BrainRegion> projection neurons.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The <BrainRegion>dorsal globus pallidus</BrainRegion> (GP) receives major inputs from the <BrainRegion>dorsal neostriatum</BrainRegion> (Str), the <BrainRegion>subthalamic nucleus</BrainRegion> (STN) and the <BrainRegion>dorsal thalamus</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>globus pallidus</BrainRegion>(GP) projects to multiple <BrainRegion>basal ganglia nuclei</BrainRegion>. One of the <BrainRegion>globus pallidus</BrainRegion>(GP) projection sites is the <BrainRegion>Str</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>pallidostriatal</BrainRegion> projection has been considered minor. However, several recent studies have suggested that this projection is heavier than previously thought and that it might play a significant role in controlling the activity of the <BrainRegion>Str</BrainRegion>. To reveal more details of this projection, we examined the number of <BrainRegion>globus pallidus</BrainRegion>(GP) neurons that participated in the projection, their origins in the <BrainRegion>globus pallidus</BrainRegion>(GP) and their immunoreactivity for the calcium binding protein parvalbumin (PV), by using a combination of Fluoro-Gold (FG) retrograde labeling and immunohistochemical methods. Immunostaining for the calcium binding protein calbindin-28K (CaBP) was used to identify the calcium binding protein calbindin-28K(CaBP) -poor sensorimotor and calcium binding protein calbindin-28K(CaBP) -rich associative <BrainRegion>Str</BrainRegion> regions and the corresponding calcium binding protein calbindin-28K(CaBP) -poor middle, calcium binding protein calbindin-28K(CaBP) -rich border, and the <BrainRegion>caudomedial globus pallidus</BrainRegion>(GP) regions. The calcium binding protein calbindin-28K(CaBP) -poor <BrainRegion>dorsolateral Str</BrainRegion> region occupies a small portion of the <BrainRegion>Str</BrainRegion>, whereas the calcium binding protein calbindin-28K(CaBP) -poor <BrainRegion>middle globus pallidus</BrainRegion>(GP) region occupies a large portion of the <BrainRegion>globus pallidus</BrainRegion>(GP) . The immunostaining for neuron-specific nuclear protein (NeuN) was used to visualize neurons that were immunonegative for Fluoro-Gold(FG) or parvalbumin(PV) . Cell counts revealed that the <BrainRegion>middle globus pallidus</BrainRegion>(GP) region contained a higher density of neurons and also a higher percentage of parvalbumin(PV) -positive neurons than the border and <BrainRegion>caudomedial regions of the globus pallidus</BrainRegion>(GP) . These observations suggested that the <BrainRegion>globus pallidus</BrainRegion>(GP) is involved more in sensorimotor function than associative function. Approximately 40% of neurons in the calcium binding protein calbindin-28K(CaBP) -poor <BrainRegion>middle globus pallidus</BrainRegion>(GP) region project to the calcium binding protein calbindin-28K(CaBP) -poor part of the <BrainRegion>dorsolateral Str</BrainRegion>. Approximately 30% of the neurons in both the calcium binding protein calbindin-28K(CaBP) -rich border and the <BrainRegion>caudomedial globus pallidus</BrainRegion>(GP) regions project to the calcium binding protein calbindin-28K(CaBP) -rich <BrainRegion>Str</BrainRegion> region. More than 40% of the <BrainRegion>pallidostriatal</BrainRegion> neurons in calcium binding protein calbindin-28K(CaBP) -poor <BrainRegion>middle globus pallidus</BrainRegion>(GP) region are parvalbumin(PV) -positive, whereas most of those in calcium binding protein calbindin-28K(CaBP) -rich <BrainRegion>globus pallidus</BrainRegion>(GP) regions are parvalbumin(PV) -negative. It was estimated from the cell count data that most of the parvalbumin(PV) -negative neurons in all three regions of the <BrainRegion>globus pallidus</BrainRegion>(GP) project to the <BrainRegion>Str</BrainRegion>. The results indicate that the sensorimotor and associative territories of the <BrainRegion>Str</BrainRegion> have reciprocal projections between corresponding territories of the <BrainRegion>globus pallidus</BrainRegion>(GP) . The involvement of a large number of <BrainRegion>globus pallidus</BrainRegion>(GP) neurons suggested that the <BrainRegion>pallidostriatal</BrainRegion> projection should be taken into account in the analysis of functional roles of the <BrainRegion>basal ganglia</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Structural and functional characterization of a muscle tendon proprioceptor in lobster.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>A morphological and electrophysiological study was made on a unique primary mechanosensory neuron, the anterior gastric receptor (AGR), previously shown to arise from power-stroke muscle gm1 of the gastric mill system in the lobster foregut. Ultrastructural analysis of horseradish peroxidase injected anterior gastric receptor(AGR) demonstrated that its peripheral dendrites do not ramify in muscle but are confined strictly to the connective tissue/epidermal interface in the tendon of gm1. These terminals are rich in mitochondria and at their very endings are free of glial cell wrapping, suggesting that they are the site at which mechano-transduction occurs. Extracellular axonal recordings from an in vitro neuromuscular preparation consisting of the gm1 muscle still attached to the stomatogastric nervous system, revealed that anterior gastric receptor(AGR) is activated by passive stretch of gm1. The response to ramp stimuli displays dynamic and static components, both of which increase with the amplitude of applied stretch, while the dynamic component is also velocity sensitive. anterior gastric receptor(AGR) is also activated by muscle contraction here elicited either by application of exogenous acetylcholine, the excitatory neurotransmitter for gm1, or by electrical stimulation of the motoneurons (GM) themselves. Consistent with a receptor lying in-series with its muscle, therefore, the effective stimulus of anterior gastric receptor(AGR) in vivo is probably an increase in tension exerted on the tendon during active muscle contraction. In neuromuscular preparations including the bilateral commissural ganglia, stretching gm1 reflexly activates GM motoneurons at low stimulus strengths but leads to an inactivation of GM motoneurons at high stimulus strengths. This is consistent with earlier findings that both responses can be elicited by direct electrical stimulation of anterior gastric receptor(AGR) . The functional implications of anterior gastric receptor(AGR) &apos;s anatomical relationship with muscle gm1, the receptor's response properties, and its central effects on motor output to gm1 are discussed. Comparison is also drawn between this first reported example of a true tendon receptor in invertebrates and muscle receptors of vertebrates.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Small-field neurons associated with oculomotor control in muscoid flies: cellular organization in the <BrainRegion>lobula plate</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>In muscoid flies, the <BrainRegion>lobula plate</BrainRegion> is the last station in the <BrainRegion>optic lobes</BrainRegion> for processing spectrally independent information from retinotopic afferents. Until recently, it was thought that most <BrainRegion>lobula plate</BrainRegion> neurons were color-insensitive wide-field tangential neurons that respond to direction-specific motion. It has been suggested that certain of these supply inputs to premotor descending neurons involved in the control of flight and head movements. The present account describes a Golgi and cobalt-silver analysis that reports evidence for additional <BrainRegion>lobula plate</BrainRegion> outputs, which are numerically complex and structurally elaborate. Beneath a <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> with approximately 4,000 ommatidia, each of at least 15 populations of morphologically distinct small-field neurons comprises approximately 110-440 elements that contribute to an isomorphic neural assembly subtending the whole <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>. Morphologically small-field efferents form three classes according to the origin of their axons and their arborization in the <BrainRegion>lobula plate</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>lobula</BrainRegion>. Neurons arising from the <BrainRegion>lobula plate</BrainRegion>, or shared by it and the <BrainRegion>lobula</BrainRegion>, visit dorsal descending neurons supplying the neck and flight motor in contrast to output neurons from the <BrainRegion>lobula</BrainRegion>, which project to ventral descending neurons supplying leg motor neuropils. The possible functional significance of small-field <BrainRegion>lobula plate</BrainRegion> outputs onto descending neurons in the <BrainRegion>dorsal deutocerebrum</BrainRegion> is discussed.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Fine structure of the <BrainRegion>medullary lateral line area</BrainRegion> of Chelon labrosus (order perciformes), a nonelectroreceptive teleost.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The ultrastructure and synaptic organization of the <BrainRegion>nucleus medialis</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>cerebellar crest</BrainRegion> of the teleost Chelon labrosus have been investigated. The <BrainRegion>nucleus medialis</BrainRegion> receives projections from the <BrainRegion>anterior and posterior lateral line nerves</BrainRegion>. This nucleus consists of oval neurons and large crest cells (&quot;Purkinje-like" cells) whose apical dendrites branch in the overlying molecular layer, the <BrainRegion>cerebellar crest</BrainRegion>. In the <BrainRegion>dorsal region of the nucleus medialis</BrainRegion>, the perikarya and smooth primary dendrites of the <BrainRegion>crest cells</BrainRegion> are interspersed among myelinated fibers and nerve boutons. The ventral layer of the <BrainRegion>nucleus medialis</BrainRegion> contains crest cell perikarya and dendrites as well as oval neurons. The <BrainRegion>cerebellar crest</BrainRegion> lacks neuronal bodies, but the apical dendrites of crest cells receive synapses from unmyelinated and myelinated fibers. In the <BrainRegion>cerebellar crest</BrainRegion>, two types of terminals are presynaptic to the crest cell dendrites: boutons with spherical vesicles that form asymmetric synapses with dendritic spines and boutons containing pleomorphic vesicles that form symmetric synapses directly on the dendritic shaft. Most axon terminals found on the somata and primary dendrites of crest cells in the <BrainRegion>nucleus medialis</BrainRegion> have pleomorphic vesicles and form symmetric contacts, though asymmetric synapses with spherical vesicles and mixed synapses can be observed; these mixed synapses exhibit gap junctions and contain spherical vesicles. Unlike crest cells, the oval neuron perikarya receive three types of contacts (symmetric, asymmetric, and mixed). The origins and functions of these different bouton types in the <BrainRegion>nucleus medialis</BrainRegion> are discussed.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Increased citrullinated glial fibrillary acidic protein in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>In this study, we demonstrate that grossly unaffected white matter from secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SP-MS) patients is heavily citrullinated, as compared to normal white matter from control patients. Citrullination was most pronounced at plaque interfaces and was shown to colocalize with glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-immunoreactivity using dual color immunofluorescence. In contrast, the plaques themselves weakly stained for citrullinated proteins compared to control white matter and usually contained a blood vessel with surrounding astrocytes that were positive both for citrullinated proteins and glial fibrillary acidic protein(GFAP) . In secondary progressive multiple sclerosis(SP-MS) brain samples, but not in normal brains, long fibers of colocalized glial fibrillary acidic protein(GFAP) - and citrullinated proteins extended into the gray matter. Increased numbers of astrocytes containing citrullinated proteins and glial fibrillary acidic protein(GFAP) were also present at the junction between the gray and white matter in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis(SP-MS) brains. Western blot analysis of acidic brain proteins from nonplaque-containing white matter showed upregulation of multiple citrullinated glial fibrillary acidic protein(GFAP) proteins in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis(SP-MS) brains as compared to controls. Our results demonstrate that increased amounts of citrullinated glial fibrillary acidic protein(GFAP) are present in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis(SP-MS) brains, but also shows that these proteins are present in areas of MS brains that were grossly normal appearing. These data raise the possibility that citrullination of glial fibrillary acidic protein(GFAP) contributes to the pathophysiology of MS.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Development of tyrosine hydroxylase-like immunoreactive structures in the chick <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>: three-dimensional analysis.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>This study was designed to investigate the developmental profile of tyrosine hydroxylase-like immunoreactive structures in the chick retina in both frozen sections and wholemount preparations. In frozen sections, cells with tyrosine hydroxylase-like immunoreactivity were first detected in 10 to 15 cell rows from the innermost part of the inner nuclear layer on embryonic or incubation day 11. They were seen in the inner cell rows of the inner nuclear layer during later periods; by embryonic day 18, the immunoreactive cells were located 1 to 3 cell rows outward from the innermost part of the inner nuclear layer where mature immunoreactive cells mainly exist. The immunoreactive cells began to give rise to processes on embryonic day 13. The processes (possibly dendrites) gradually increased in number and intensity in sublayers 1 and 4 of the inner plexiform layer during prenatal life. Several days after hatching, an abrupt increase in immunoreactive processes was noted in sublayer 1 but not in sublayer 4. On the sixth postnatal day, <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> neural elements immunoreactive for tyrosine hydroxylase seemed to exhibit a distribution pattern similar to that of the adult chick. In wholemount <BrainRegion>retinas</BrainRegion>, immunoreactive cells were initially detected at the earliest stage of embryonic day 12 in a small circle termed &quot;starting area" occupying the ventral part of the <BrainRegion>temporal retinal field</BrainRegion>. The closer to the &quot;starting area," the earlier the <BrainRegion>retinal area</BrainRegion> began to express many immunoreactive cells. Thus tyrosine hydroxylase cell density in individual <BrainRegion>retinal areas</BrainRegion>, as represented by cell number per square millimeter, peaked in different developmental periods varying from embryonic day 12 to day 14. At this stage, immunoreactive cells were arranged irregularly in the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>. Thereafter, the cell density as well as total cell number gradually declined and reached a plateau around embryonic day 20 when tyrosine hydroxylase-like immunoreactive cells, like those in the mature <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>, showed an even distribution throughout the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Formation of cadherin-expressing brain nuclei in <BrainRegion>diencephalic alar plate</BrainRegion> divisions.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>During the formation of brain nuclei, the vertebrate <BrainRegion>neural tube</BrainRegion> is partitioned into distinct embryonic divisions. In this study, the expression of three members of the cadherin family of adhesion molecules (cadherin-6B, cadherin-7, and R-cadherin) was mapped to study the differentiation of gray matter in the divisions of the <BrainRegion>diencephalic alar plate</BrainRegion> of chicken embryos from embryonic day 3 (E3) to E10. At early stages of development ( embryonic day 3(E3) -E4), each cadherin is expressed in restricted regions of the <BrainRegion>diencephalic</BrainRegion> wall of the <BrainRegion>neural tube</BrainRegion>. The borders of some of the expression domains coincide with divisional boundaries. As the mantle layer is formed and increases in thickness from E4 to E8, morphologically discernible aggregates of cells appear that express the three cadherins differentially. These aggregates represent the anlagen of specific <BrainRegion>diencephalic brain nuclei</BrainRegion>, e.g., the <BrainRegion>lateroanterior nucleus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>ventral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>nucleus rotundus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>perirotundic area</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>principal precommissural nucleus</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>lateral spiriform nucleus</BrainRegion>. Most of the cadherin-expressing <BrainRegion>diencephalic nuclei</BrainRegion> studied in this work apparently derive from a single embryonic division and remain there. The divisional boundaries are replaced gradually by the borders of cadherin-expressing brain nuclei. The current results support the idea that cadherins confer differential adhesiveness to developing structures of gray matter in the <BrainRegion>diencephalic alar plate</BrainRegion>. Moreover, they suggest that each cadherin plays a role in the formation of specific brain nuclei within the <BrainRegion>diencephalic divisions</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Permanent neuronal cell loss in the <BrainRegion>cerebellum</BrainRegion> of rats exposed to continuous low blood alcohol levels during the brain growth spurt: a stereological investigation.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>This study demonstrates that exposure to an alcohol regimen that resulted in low, uniform blood alcohol concentrations during a period of rapid brain growth can lead to a permanent deficit in the number of Purkinje cells and granule cells in the <BrainRegion>floccular-parafloccular region of the cerebellum</BrainRegion>. Sprague-Dawley rat pups were artificially reared and were administered alcohol over postnatal days 4 through 9, a period of brain development similar to that of the human third trimester. Two groups received a daily alcohol dose of 4.5 g/kg, administered either as a 10.2% solution in two of the 12 daily feedings (10.2% group) or as a 5.1% solution in four of the 12 feedings (5.1% group). A third group received a daily dose of 6.6 g/kg administered as a 2.5% solution in every feeding (2.5% group). The condensed patterns of alcohol administration resulted in high peak blood alcohol concentrations with near total clearance while the higher daily dose (6.6 g/kg), administered continuously, resulted in low but continuous blood alcohol concentrations. Pups were allowed to grow to adulthood and killed on postnatal day 115. The total number of Purkinje cells and granule cells in the <BrainRegion>floccular-parafloccular region of the cerebellum</BrainRegion> was estimated using unbiased stereological methods. Exposure to alcohol resulted in significant deficits in the number of both Purkinje cells and granule cells at 115 days of age in all three treatment groups. Most importantly a significant deficit of Purkinje cells and granule cells was found following continuous exposure to low blood alcohol concentrations, i.e., in the 2.5% group. The total number of Purkinje cells in the 2.5% group was 2.33 +/- 0.31 x 10(4) compared with 3.18 +/- 0.30 x 10(4) in the artificially reared controls. The total number of granule cells in the 2.5% group and the controls was 1.24 +/- 0.10 x 10(7) and 1.64 +/- 0.19 x 10(7), respectively. These results support the hypothesis that exposure to a continuous, low blood alcohol concentration can result in the death of developing neurons and lead to permanent neuronal deficits. The degree of neuronal loss does not correlate with the magnitude of the peaks of blood alcohol concentration.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Neuroblast protuberances in the <BrainRegion>subventricular zone</BrainRegion> of the regenerative MRL/MpJ mouse.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The MRL mouse is unique in its capacity for regenerative healing of wounds. This regenerative ability includes complete closure, with little scarring, of wounds to the ear pinna and repair of cardiac muscle, without fibrosis, following cryoinjury. Here, we examine whether neurogenic zones within the MRL brain show enhanced regenerative capacity. The largest neurogenic zone in the adult brain, the <BrainRegion>subventricular zone</BrainRegion> (SVZ), lies adjacent to the lateral wall of the <BrainRegion>lateral ventricle</BrainRegion> and is responsible for replacement of interneuron populations within the <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>. Initial gross observation of the <BrainRegion>anterior forebrain</BrainRegion> in MRL mice revealed enlarged <BrainRegion>lateral ventricles</BrainRegion>; however, little neurodegeneration was detected within the <BrainRegion>subventricular zone</BrainRegion>(SVZ) or surrounding tissues. Instead, increased proliferation within the <BrainRegion>subventricular zone</BrainRegion>(SVZ) was observed, based on incorporation of the thymidine analogue bromodeoxyuridine. Closer examination using electron microscopy revealed that a significant number of <BrainRegion>subventricular zone</BrainRegion>(SVZ) astrocytes interpolated within the <BrainRegion>ependyma</BrainRegion> and established contact with the ventricle. In addition, <BrainRegion>subependymal</BrainRegion>, protuberant nests of cells, consisting primarily of neuroblasts, were found along the <BrainRegion>anterior subventricular zone</BrainRegion>(SVZ) of MRL mice. Whole mounts of the lateral wall of the <BrainRegion>lateral ventricle</BrainRegion> stained for the neuroblast marker doublecortin revealed normal formation of chains of migratory neuroblasts along the entire wall and introduction of enhanced green fluorescent protein-tagged retrovirus into the <BrainRegion>lateral ventricles</BrainRegion> confirmed that newly generated neuroblasts were able to track into the <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Early postmitotic neurons transiently express TOAD-64, a neural specific protein.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>To identify proteins involved in the early development of the mammalian <BrainRegion>cerebral cortex</BrainRegion>, we previously used two-dimensional gels to compare proteins synthesized at different stages in corticogenesis in the embryonic rat at embryonic day 14 (E14), E17, and E21. During this period, the <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion> develops from a morphologically homogeneous population of proliferative precursor cells into a complex structure containing a diverse array of terminally differentiated neurons. Several proteins are up-regulated coincident with the generation of postmitotic neurons. Here we describe the purification, partial amino acid sequencing, and characterization of one of these proteins, TOAD-64 (Turned On After Division; 64 kDa), using polyclonal antisera to two synthetic peptides from the protein. This analysis reveals that TOAD-64 is a 64,000 Da protein that increases in abundance over the period of corticogenesis and then subsequently decreases to very low levels in the adult. The protein is neural specific and is expressed by postmitotic neurons as they begin their migration out of the ventricular zone into the developing <BrainRegion>cortical plate</BrainRegion>. It is expressed in advance of most other neuronal proteins. Progenitor cells do not express TOAD-64. Therefore, this protein is a marker for postmitotic cells that have made a commitment to a neuronal phenotype. The extremely early expression, the relative abundance in newly born neurons, as well as the restriction in expression to the period of initial neuronal differentiation suggest that TOAD-64 may be a key structural protein for early neuronal function.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Variation of <BrainRegion>dorsal horn</BrainRegion> cell dendritic spread with map scale.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Cells in laminae III, IV, and V of cat <BrainRegion>dorsal horn</BrainRegion> were injected with horseradish peroxidase or neurobiotin. Dorsal views of the dendritic domains were constructed in order to measure their lengths, widths, areas, and length/width ratios in the horizontal plane (the plane of the somatotopic map). Dendritic domain width and area in the horizontal plane were negatively correlated with fractional distance between the <BrainRegion>medial and lateral edges of the dorsal horn</BrainRegion>. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that dendritic domain width varies with map scale, which is maximal in the <BrainRegion>medial dorsal horn</BrainRegion>. This is similar to the variation in widths of primary afferent bouton distributions. The parallel variation of <BrainRegion>dorsal horn</BrainRegion> cell dendritic domain width and primary afferent bouton distribution width with map scale suggests that there is a causal relation between morphology and map scale in the <BrainRegion>dorsal horn</BrainRegion> representation of the hindlimb. This variation of adult morphology with map scale must reflect mechanisms responsible for the assembly of receptive fields.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Light and electron microscopic study of m2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor in the <BrainRegion>basal forebrain</BrainRegion> of the rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The m2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor gene is expressed at high levels in <BrainRegion>basal forebrain</BrainRegion>, but the paucity of information about localization of the encoded receptor protein has limited the understanding of cellular and subcellular mechanisms involved in cholinergic actions in this region. The present study sought to determine the cellular localization of m2 protein, its relationship to cholinergic neurons, and its pre- and postsynaptic distribution in the rat <BrainRegion>medial septum-diagonal band complex</BrainRegion> using immunocytochemistry with polyclonal rabbit antibodies and a newly developed rat monoclonal antibody specific to the m2 receptor. Light microscopic colocalization studies demonstrated that m2 was present in a subset of choline acetyltransferase immunoreactive neurons, in choline acetyltransferase-negative neurons, and in more neuropil elements than was choline acetyltransferase. Intraventricular injections of 192 IgG-saporin, an immunotoxin directed to the low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor, resulted in depletion of choline acetyltransferase-immunoreactive neurons in the <BrainRegion>medial septum-diagonal band complex</BrainRegion>, whereas m2 immunoreactivity in neurons and in the neuropil was unchanged. By electron microscopy, m2 receptor in <BrainRegion>medial septum-diagonal band complex</BrainRegion> was localized to the plasmalemma of a small population of small to medium-sized neurons, and it was also found in dendrites, axons, and axon terminals in the neuropil. Neurons expressing m2 immunoreactivity received synaptic contacts from unlabelled axon terminals. A small distinct subpopulation of large neurons, unlabelled by m2 immunoreactivity, received synaptic contacts from m2-immunoreactive terminals. Thus, m2 receptor is situated to mediate the local effects of acetylcholine on <BrainRegion>basal forebrain</BrainRegion> cholinergic and noncholinergic neurons and, also, at both pre- and postsynaptic sites.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Expression of presynaptic proteins is closely correlated with the chronotopic pattern of axons in the retinotectal system of the chick.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Newly synthesized presynaptic integral membrane proteins in neurons are transported in precursor vesicles from the site of protein biosynthesis in the cell body by fast axonal flow to the presynaptic terminal. We followed the path that presynaptic proteins travel on the way to their central targets of the highly ordered primary visual pathway of the chick and analyzed the developmental changes in the expression of synaptic vesicle protein 2 (SV2), synaptotagmin, and syntaxin. Immunofluorescences revealed that: (1) the onset of protein expression in the retinal ganglion cells occurs in a central to peripheral developmental pattern from embryonic day 4 (E4) onward; (2) the proteins were found first in the inner and later in the outer plexiform layer of the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>; and (3) they were redistributed from the photoreceptor inner segments and cell bodies to the terminals in the outer plexiform layer. From embryonic day 4(E4) onward, immunopositive axons for synaptic vesicle protein 2(SV2) , synaptotagmin, and syntaxin were found in the <BrainRegion>optic nerve</BrainRegion>, disappearing after E9 for synaptic vesicle protein 2(SV2) and synaptotagmin. The optic tract was stained for synaptic vesicle protein 2(SV2) and synaptotagmin between E7 and E12, for syntaxin until the posthatching period. Finally, immunoreactivities for the investigated proteins were present at the surface of the <BrainRegion>tectum</BrainRegion> from E8 onward, when first retinal axons arrived there. The present study revealed that synaptic vesicle protein 2(SV2) and synaptotagmin, but not syntaxin, are, expressed in a transient wave that follows the advancement of optic axons and the proteins towards the <BrainRegion>optic tectum</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Morphology of jaw-muscle spindle afferents in the rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The morphology of jaw-muscle spindle afferents in the rat has been studied by intra-axonal injection of horseradish peroxidase. All stained axons were located in the motor root of the <BrainRegion>trigeminal nerve</BrainRegion> and could be traced dorsomedially to the vicinity of the <BrainRegion>trigeminal motor nucleus</BrainRegion>, where they divided into an ascending branch in the tract of the <BrainRegion>mesencephalic nucleus</BrainRegion> and a descending branch in the tract of Probst. Axon collaterals and swellings on fine collateral branches presumed to be synaptic boutons were located in the following regions: the <BrainRegion>trigeminal motor nucleus</BrainRegion>, the region dorsal to the <BrainRegion>trigeminal motor nucleus</BrainRegion> including the <BrainRegion>supratrigeminal nucleus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>parvicellular reticular formation</BrainRegion> immediately caudal to the <BrainRegion>trigeminal motor nucleus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>reticular formation</BrainRegion> at the level of the <BrainRegion>facial nucleus</BrainRegion>, and the caudal portion of the <BrainRegion>mesencephalic nucleus</BrainRegion>. No evidence of a projection to the <BrainRegion>cerebellum</BrainRegion> was observed. Boutons were most numerous in the region surrounding the <BrainRegion>trigeminal motor nucleus</BrainRegion>, especially dorsally. Here they were not demonstrated in close proximity to counterstained cells, and therefore it was not possible to determine how many of these contacts are located on cells in this region and how many are on the distal dendrites of trigeminal motorneurons. Boutons located within the <BrainRegion>trigeminal motor nucleus</BrainRegion> were always confined to a small portion of the nucleus and were significantly larger than those located dorsally. Some boutons were found in close apposition to trigeminal motorneurons and presumably make somatic contacts. These results suggest that jaw-muscle spindle afferents make somatic and proximal dendritic contacts with only a limited number of trigeminal motorneurons and also project to masticatory interneuronal regions dorsal and caudal to the <BrainRegion>motor nucleus</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>An intracellular HRP study of the rat <BrainRegion>globus pallidus</BrainRegion>. II. Fine structural characteristics and synaptic connections of medially located large GP neurons.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>In order to classify the presynaptic elements contacting the principle class of <BrainRegion>globus pallidus</BrainRegion> neurons, electron microscopic examination of serial sections made from a medially located large <BrainRegion>globus pallidus</BrainRegion> neuron, labeled with intracellular horseradish peroxidase, was undertaken. In addition, the use of labeled and light microscopically reconstructed material allowed us to quantitatively determine the distribution of each bouton type along the soma and dendrites. Six types of presynaptic terminals contacting the labeled cell have been recognized. Type 1 endings, the most numerous (84%), make symmetrical contacts on all portions of the cell, except spines, contain large pleomorphic, and a few large dense-core vesicles. Type 2 endings are filled with small spherical-to-ellipsoidal synaptic vesicles. They make asymmetrical contacts only with higher-order dendrites and account for 12% of synaptic contacts onto the labeled neuron. Type 3 endings are large, contain sparsely distributed large pleomorphic vesicles, and make two symmetrical synapses per bouton, one onto a spine head and the other onto the underlying dendritic shaft. They are infrequent (0.2%), being found only in association with dendritic spines. Type 4 endings contain large pleomorphic synaptic vesicles and no dense-core vesicles. They make symmetrical contacts with the short primary dendrites. Type 5 endings contain a mixture of small clear pleomorphic vesicles and numerous large dense-core vesicles. They contact only the cell body and the short primary dendrites, making up 20% of somatic synaptic contacts but less than 1% of contacts onto dendrites. Type 6 boutons contain oval and flattened synaptic vesicles and establish symmetrical contacts with higher-order dendritic branches and the cell body.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Axonal pathfinding during the regeneration of the goldfish optic pathway.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText><BrainRegion>Retinal</BrainRegion> ganglion cells in fish and amphibians regenerate their axons after transection of the <BrainRegion>optic nerve</BrainRegion>. Fiber tracing studies during the third month of regeneration show that the axons have reestablished a basically normal fiber order in the two brachia of the optic tract; axons originating in the <BrainRegion>ventral hemiretina</BrainRegion> are concentrated in the dorsal brachium, axons from the <BrainRegion>dorsal hemiretina</BrainRegion> in the ventral brachium. Attardi and Sperry (Exp. Neurol. 7:46-64, 1963) first suggested that the reestablishment of the fiber order reflects path-finding by the regenerating axons. Recently, however, Becker and Cook (Development 101:323-337, 1987) have claimed that the fiber order observed at later stages of regeneration is due to secondary axonal rearrangements and that the initial brachial choice is random. In order to evaluate whether regenerating axons are capable of navigating in the optic tract and brachia and on the <BrainRegion>tectum</BrainRegion>, the present study examined the pathway choices and the morphology of regenerating axons en route to their <BrainRegion>tectal</BrainRegion> targets in goldfish. Subsets of axons were labeled at various time intervals (2 to 30 days) following an <BrainRegion>optic nerve</BrainRegion> crush, by intraretinal application of the lipophilic fluorescent tracer 1,1-dioctadecyl-3-3-3&apos;-3'-tetramethylcarbocyanine (DiI). After a survival time of 18 to 72 hours (to allow for diffusion of DiI along the axons), the experimental animals were perfused with fixative and their right and left <BrainRegion>optic pathways (nerve, tract, and tectum)</BrainRegion> were dissected free and separated at the <BrainRegion>chiasm</BrainRegion>. Fluorescently labeled axons were traced in whole-mounted pathways. Pathway choices were examined at the brachial bifurcation where axons from <BrainRegion>ventral and dorsal hemiretinae</BrainRegion> normally segregate. DiI was found to label axons reliably up to their growth cones, even at the earliest stages of regrowth. The pathway choices of the axons were nonrandom. The majority of the ventral axons reached the appropriate, <BrainRegion>dorsal hemitectum</BrainRegion> through the appropriate dorsal brachium of the tract. Dorsal axons reached the <BrainRegion>ventral hemitectum</BrainRegion> mainly through the ventral brachium. This suggests the presence of specific guidance cues, accessible to the regenerating axons. Differences in the complexity of the growth cones of the regenerating axons (simple in the nerve and <BrainRegion>tectal</BrainRegion> fiber layer, complex in the tract and the synaptic layer of the <BrainRegion>tectum</BrainRegion>) provide further evidence for specific interactions between the regenerating axons and their substrates along the pathway. These results argue that regenerating <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> axons in fish are capable of axonal path-finding.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Postnatal differentiation of rat <BrainRegion>optic nerve</BrainRegion> fibers: electron microscopic observations on the development of nodes of Ranvier and axoglial relations.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The postnatal differentiation of rat <BrainRegion>optic nerve</BrainRegion> fibres was examined by transmission electron microscopy. The results show that many early developing axons contain clusters of vesiculotubular profiles prior to myelination. At places vesicular elements appear to fuse with the axolemma, and, in addition, some axons exhibit deep axolemmal invaginations and axoplasmic lamellated bodies. It is suggested that these features might reflect axolemmal remodelling, possibly involving axoglial signalling and/or functional differentiation of the axolemma. The size distribution of unmyelinated optic nerve axons changes little during development. Ensheathment of larger axons commences 6 days postnatally. The subsequent formation of compact myelin sheaths is accompanied by an increase in axonal diameter. The early sheaths are a few microns long and separated by long bare axon segments. In <BrainRegion>optic nerves</BrainRegion> from 10-12-day-old rat pups, a few sheaths consisting of about five layers border primitive asymmetric nodes with a patchy axolemmal undercoating. Extensions from one of the terminating sheaths are often associated with undercoated patches of axolemma. Relatively differentiated nodes of Ranvier first appear 14-16 days after birth. The continued nodal maturation involves establishment of a regular nodal geometry, increasing distinctness of the axolemmal undercoating, and formation of perinodal astrocytic processes embedded in an extracellular node gap substance. The results are compared with available data on the conduction properties of rat <BrainRegion>optic nerve</BrainRegion> fibres during development.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Induction of cell division in olfactory basal epithelium following intranasal irrigation with wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The lectin, wheatgerm agglutinin (WGA) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP), previously was shown to be transported into the central nervous system following application by intranasal irrigation. The current study investigated the hypothesis that uptake of molecules, such as the lectin-conjugate, by olfactory receptor cells would mimic internalization of other substances including odorants. This process would result in both premature death of receptor cells and increased turnover of their precursors, globose basal cells. Tetramethylbenzidine histochemical analysis showed the presence of significant amounts of the lectin-conjugate in both the receptor epithelium and <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> until at least 2 weeks postintranasal application. Neither supporting nor globose basal cells contained wheatgerm agglutinin(WGA) - horseradish peroxidase(HRP) , suggesting that uptake was primarily into olfactory receptor cells. Cell turnover, assessed by tritiated-thymidine (thymidine) autoradiography, increased both 1 and 2 weeks, but not 3 and 4 weeks, following intranasal irrigation with wheatgerm agglutinin(WGA) - horseradish peroxidase(HRP) . Most of the cells containing thymidine labelling appeared to be globose basal cells, although supporting cells also occasionally exhibited labelling. Survival of either mature or immature receptor cells in the epithelium, indicated by epithelial thickness and cell density of the septal epithelium, also declined following treatment. These data suggest that uptake of substances may result in cell loss from the olfactory epithelium and increased mitotic activity of basal cells.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Regulation in the number of fly photoreceptor synapses: the effects of alterations in the number of presynaptic cells.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>At the equator of the fly&apos;s eye, between dorsal and ventral eye halves, a systematic, natural addition of photoreceptor terminal input occurs at each of the fixed populations of uniquely identifiable postsynaptic interneurons in each cartridge of the first optic neuropile, or lamina. The equatorial cartridges are identical in composition except in having seven and eight receptor terminals (7R and 8R, respectively), compared with six elsewhere (6R cartridges). The effects of this augmented presynaptic input upon the frequency of the chief afferent class of photoreceptor tetrad synapse were studied compared with control data for 6R cartridges (Nicol and Meinertzhagen, '82). The synapse population size and distribution within five depth levels of the lamina is, on average, approximately constant for all receptor terminals whether from 6R, 7R, or 8R cartridges. The overall determinant of synapse frequency is therefore presynaptic. Small (5-6%) average decreases in synapse frequency per receptor in 7R and 8R cartridges compared with 6R co-vary with similar decreases in membrane area, each synapse occupying a patch of membrane of similar area in all cases. The tetradic postsynaptic composition of synapses was also similar in all cases. Because of the augmented synaptic input to the postsynaptic neurons, a morphometric analysis was undertaken of two (L1 and L2), which receive input as a pair from every synapse. There is the same dendrite number (about 180) in 8R L1/L2 as in 6R L1/L2 but they have different branching patterns, conforming to the different number and configuration of receptor terminals. Thus in an 8R cartridge each terminal is serviced by a comb of fewer dendrites, but each dendrite is longer, fatter, and services more synapses. The area of L1/L2 dendritic membrane exposed is increased, compared with 6R cartridges, in proportion with the number of synapses it participates at postsynaptically, so that all dendrites (6R and 8R) allocate the same mean area (about 0.55 micrometer2) of postsynaptic membrane per synapse.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Rod and cone input to horizontal cells in the rabbit <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>In the rabbit <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>, there are two types of horizontal cell (HC). The A-type horizontal cell(HC) is axonless and extensively coupled. The B-type horizontal cell(HC) is axon bearing; the somatic dendrites are radially symmetric and form a second coupled network, while the axon branches expansively to form a complex terminal structure. The B-type axon terminals (ATs) are independently coupled to form a third network in the outer plexiform layer. We have modified our dye-injection methods to obtain detailed fills of the three different horizontal cell networks for analysis via confocal microscopy. We have confirmed that A-type horizontal cell(HC) s and the somatic dendrites of B-type horizontal cell(HC) s receive input exclusively from cones, whereas the B-type axon terminals(ATs) receive input only from rods. A single B-type AT may receive input from as many as 1,000 rods, but, surprisingly, our data reveal only one end terminal per rod spherule. The somatic dendrites of A- and B-type horizontal cell(HC) s form clusters at each cone pedicle coincident with GluR2/3 and GluR4 glutamate receptor subunits. The B-type axon terminals(ATs) have GluR2/3- or GluR4-labeled glutamate receptors in two locations: small puncta on the end terminals within the rod spherule invagination and large clusters on the terminal stalks, approximately 1.5 microm from the rod synaptic ribbon. We conclude that AMPA receptors of the same or similar composition mediate photoreceptor input to all types of horizontal cell(HC) s.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Effect of tetraploidy on dendritic branching in neurons and glial cells of the frog, Xenopus laevis.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Morphological aspects of four different groups of Golgi impregnated brain cells from a tetraploid strain of Xenopus laevis frogs were compared to analogous cells in comparably sized diploid frogs. The cells examined included neurons from the <BrainRegion>telencephalon</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>caudal hypothalamus</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>optic tectum</BrainRegion>, and radial glial cells from the <BrainRegion>optic tectum</BrainRegion>. The brains of tetraploid frogs appeared grossly normal and were the same size and contained similar cell types as diploid brains. As observed in previous studies on polyploid amphibia, somal diameters increased significantly in tetraploid cells for each of the four groups of cells examined. Also, the total length of the dendritic arbors in tetraploid brain cells increased significantly by factors ranging from 1.4 to 2.4 times the total length of the analogous processes in diploid cells. Tetraploid neurons in the <BrainRegion>telencephalon</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion> increased their arbor lengths predominantly by increasing the number of dendritic branches, while maintaining the average distance between branch points in the dendritic segments. In contrast, the tetraploid large pear-shaped neurons in the <BrainRegion>optic tectum</BrainRegion> had significantly longer terminal dendritic segments than the analogous diploid neurons, although these tetraploid neurons maintained their average number of dendritic segments per cell. Tetraploid <BrainRegion>tectal</BrainRegion> radial glial cells appeared to increase both their number of branches and the lengths of their terminal segments. Thus, the mode by which tetraploid brain cells achieved longer dendritic arbors varied from cell type to cell type. These results suggest a hypothetical basis for possible effects of genomic size on vertebrate brain structure and evolution at the cellular level.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Morphological changes in the Royal College of Surgeons rat retina during photoreceptor degeneration and after cell-based therapy.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>There are concomitant morphological and functional changes in the <BrainRegion>inner retina</BrainRegion> during the course of photoreceptor degeneration in a range of animal models of <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> degeneration and in humans with eye disease. One concern that has been raised is that the changes occurring in the <BrainRegion>inner retina</BrainRegion> might compromise attempts to rescue or restore visual input by various interventional approaches. It is known that cell-based therapy can preserve significant visual capability for many months. In this study, we examine the overall changes in the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) rat during degeneration and the effects of cell transplantation by means of immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy. The degenerative changes are complex, and they progress with age. They involve the neurons with which both rods and cones interconnect--retinal second- and third-order neurons underwent dramatic modification, including sprouting, retraction as photoreceptor loss progressed--as well as Müller glia and secondary vascular changes, which were associated at later times with neuronal migration. The pathological vascular changes led to major disruption of <BrainRegion>inner retina</BrainRegion>. After introducing a <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> pigment epithelial cell line to the <BrainRegion>subretinal space</BrainRegion> early in the progress of photoreceptor degeneration, most <BrainRegion>inner retinal</BrainRegion> changes were held in abeyance for up to at least 10 months of age. Given the concern that has been raised regarding whether <BrainRegion>inner retinal</BrainRegion> changes might compromise any graft-related benefit, this is an encouraging finding.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Intracellular injection of neurobiotin or horseradish peroxidase reveals separate types of preganglionic neurons in the <BrainRegion>sacral parasympathetic nucleus</BrainRegion> of the cat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Sacral preganglionic neurons are essential to the neural control of the excretory and sex organs. Previously employed multi-cell tracing methods have certain limitations in the precise morphological analysis of the neural pathways that control these organs. These limitations were overcome by the intracellular injection of neurobiotin or horseradish peroxidase into single preganglionic neurons in the <BrainRegion>lateral sacral parasympathetic nucleus</BrainRegion> of the cat. Following light microscopic examination, these neurons, as a group, were found to have an average of five stem dendrites, which divided into 15 dendritic end-branches that were distributed among eight dendritic terminal fields. These dendrites had a major transverse orientation and were quite long, many of them reaching well into the <BrainRegion>dorsal and ventral horns</BrainRegion> and into the <BrainRegion>dorsal gray commissure</BrainRegion>. These dendrites also exhibited a major longitudinal orientation, extending an average of 869 microns (combined length of rostral and caudal dendrites) within the nucleus. Two groups of cells emerged on the basis of different dendritic patterns. Cells classed as Type I had dendrites in lamina I and in the <BrainRegion>ventral horn</BrainRegion> but lacked a significant projection into the <BrainRegion>lateral funiculus</BrainRegion>. Cells classed as Type II had major dendritic projections into the <BrainRegion>lateral funiculus</BrainRegion> but lacked dendrites in lamina I. The diverse dendritic patterns of these two cell types indicate dissimilar afferent control mechanisms and suggest that these preganglionic neurons may innervate different target organs.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Distribution of muscarinic receptor subtypes within architectonic subregions of the primate c<BrainRegion>erebral cortex</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The regional distributions of muscarinic receptor subtypes (M1 and M2) in the macaque brain were investigated by in vitro receptor autoradiography. Putative muscarinic receptor subtypes were distinguished by their differential affinities for pirenzepine and carbachol in competition with [3H]-quinuclidinyl benzilate. Autoradiographic visualization of muscarinic receptor subtypes demonstrated marked regional and laminar variations that respected architectonic boundaries. The M1 receptor subtype was widely distributed throughout most <BrainRegion>cortical areas</BrainRegion> and was most intense over the superficial layers. Almost all <BrainRegion>limbic and paralimbic regions</BrainRegion> including the <BrainRegion>amygdala</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>orbitofrontal</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>temporopolar</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>parahippocampal</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>cingulate</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>parolfactory areas</BrainRegion> displayed peak densities of the M1 receptor subtype. The M2 receptor subtype was selectively elevated in the <BrainRegion>primary sensory areas</BrainRegion> of all five sensory modalities, including the visual (<BrainRegion>area 17</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>V1</BrainRegion>), auditory (<BrainRegion>A1</BrainRegion>), and somatosensory (<BrainRegion>3b</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>S1</BrainRegion>) <BrainRegion>koniocortices</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>anterior olfactory nucleus</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>gustatory area</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>primary motor area</BrainRegion> also displayed a relative peak of M2 receptor subtype labeling. In the <BrainRegion>hippocampal formation</BrainRegion>, M1, M2, and nicotine receptors were distributed differentially, with each subdivision having a specific complement of cholinergic receptor subtype. The M1 receptor subtype was prevalent in the <BrainRegion>dentate gyrus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>CA4</BrainRegion>-<BrainRegion>CA3</BrainRegion> region, and the <BrainRegion>CA1</BrainRegion> ammonic sector. The M2 receptor subtype was concentrated in the <BrainRegion>CA2</BrainRegion> sector, the <BrainRegion>subiculum</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>rhinal cortices</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>parasubiculum</BrainRegion>. Putative neural nicotinic receptors, tagged with L-[3H]-nicotine, were most concentrated within the <BrainRegion>presubiculum</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Accurate reinnervation of motor end plates after disruption of sheath cells and muscle fibers.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>After injury, regenerating motor axons grow back to form neuromuscular junctions at the original synaptic sites on muscle fibers. The pathways they grow along consist of basement membrane, Schwann cells, and perineurium that remained after degeneration of the original axons. All the factors necessary for directing axons to the original synaptic sites persist in muscles even after disruption of myofibers. The aim of the present experiments was to determine whether structural integrity of nerve sheath cells is required for precise reinnervation in the presence and absence of muscle fiber targets. The region of innervation of the cutaneous pectoris muscle of the frog was briefly frozen to eliminate all living cells from neuromuscular junctions, intramuscular nerve bundles, and from a 1-3-mm length of the nerve trunk. Only extracellular matrices persisted within the frozen region of muscle and nerve. These consisted of the basement membrane sheaths of myofibers, of Schwann cells, and of perineurial cells and the small fragments of disrupted cells that were bound to them. In some preparations new muscle fibers developed within the basement membrane sheaths. Regenerating axons grew through the naked basement membrane sheaths of original Schwann cells, formed numerous branches, and contacted the myofibers precisely at the original synaptic sites. By 5 weeks 75% of the original synaptic sites became reinnervated; the terminals were indistinguishable from those at normal neuromuscular junctions. In contrast, preparations in which all muscle fibers were prevented from regenerating far fewer synaptic sites became reinnervated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Comparison of <BrainRegion>hippocampal</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>amygdala</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>perirhinal</BrainRegion> projections to the <BrainRegion>nucleus accumbens</BrainRegion>: combined anterograde and retrograde tracing study in the Macaque brain.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>A combination of anterograde and retrograde tracing techniques was used to study the projections to the <BrainRegion>nucleus accumbens</BrainRegion> from the <BrainRegion>amygdala</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>hippocampal formation</BrainRegion> (including the <BrainRegion>entorhinal cortex</BrainRegion>), and the <BrainRegion>perirhinal cortex</BrainRegion> in two species of macaque monkey. To help identify possible subregions within the <BrainRegion>nucleus accumbens</BrainRegion>, the distribution of calbindin was examined in two additional monkeys. Although this revealed evidence of &quot;core"- and "shell"-like regions within the <BrainRegion>accumbens</BrainRegion>, these different regions could not consistently be related to cytoarchitectonic features. The <BrainRegion>rostral amygdala</BrainRegion> sent nearly equivalent projections to both the <BrainRegion>medial and the lateral portions of nucleus accumbens</BrainRegion>, whereas projections arising from the <BrainRegion>middle and caudal amygdala</BrainRegion> terminated preferentially in the <BrainRegion>medial division of nucleus accumbens</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>basal nucleus</BrainRegion> was the major source of these <BrainRegion>amygdala</BrainRegion> efferents, and there was a crude topography as parts of the <BrainRegion>basal and accessory basal nuclei</BrainRegion> terminated in different parts of <BrainRegion>nucleus accumbens</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>subiculum</BrainRegion> was the major source of <BrainRegion>hippocampal</BrainRegion> projections to the <BrainRegion>nucleus accumbens</BrainRegion>, but some <BrainRegion>hippocampal</BrainRegion> efferents also originated in the <BrainRegion>parasubiculum</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>prosubiculum</BrainRegion>, the adjacent portion of <BrainRegion>CA1</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>uncal portion of CA3</BrainRegion>. These <BrainRegion>hippocampal</BrainRegion> projections, which coursed through the <BrainRegion>fornix</BrainRegion>, showed a rostrocaudal gradient as more arose in the <BrainRegion>rostral hippocampus</BrainRegion>. <BrainRegion>Hippocampal</BrainRegion> efferents terminated most densely in the <BrainRegion>medial and ventral portions of nucleus accumbens</BrainRegion>, along with light label in the adjacent <BrainRegion>olfactory tubercle</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>entorhinal</BrainRegion> projections were more evenly distributed between the <BrainRegion>medial nucleus accumbens</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>olfactory tubercle</BrainRegion>, whereas the <BrainRegion>perirhinal</BrainRegion> projections were primarily to the <BrainRegion>olfactory tubercle</BrainRegion>. These <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> inputs were less reliant on the <BrainRegion>fornix</BrainRegion>. <BrainRegion>Amygdala</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>subicular</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>hippocampal</BrainRegion>) projections overlapped most completely in the <BrainRegion>medial division of nucleus accumbens</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Quantitative autoradiography of muscarinic and benzodiazepine receptors in the <BrainRegion>forebrain</BrainRegion> of the turtle, Pseudemys scripta.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The distribution of muscarinic and benzodiazepine receptors was investigated in the turtle <BrainRegion>forebrain</BrainRegion> by the technique of in vitro receptor autoradiography. Muscarinic binding sites were labeled with 1 nM 3H-quinuclidinyl benzilate (3H-QNB), and benzodiazepine sites were demonstrated with the aid of 1 nM 3H-flunitrazepam (3H-FLU). Autoradiograms generated on 3H-Ultrofilm apposed to tissue slices revealed regionally specific distributions of muscarinic and benzodiazepine binding sites that are comparable with those for mammalian brain. Dense benzodiazepine binding was found in the <BrainRegion>anterior olfactory nucleus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>lateral and dorsal cortices</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>dorsal ventricular ridge</BrainRegion> (DVR), a structure with no clear mammalian homologue. Muscarinic binding sites were most dense in the <BrainRegion>striatum</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>accumbens</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>dorsal ventricular ridge</BrainRegion>(DVR) , <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>anterior olfactory nucleus</BrainRegion>. <BrainRegion>Cortical</BrainRegion> binding sites were studied in greater detail by quantitative analysis of autoradiograms generated by using emulsion-coated coverslips. Laminar gradients of binding were observed that were specific for each radioligand; 3H-quinuclidinyl benzilate(3H-QNB) sites were most dense in the inner molecular layer in all <BrainRegion>cortical regions</BrainRegion>, whereas 3H-flunitrazepam(3H-FLU) binding was generally most concentrated in the outer molecular layer and was least dense through all layers in the <BrainRegion>dorsomedial cortex</BrainRegion>. Because pyramidal cells are arranged in register in turtle <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion>, the laminar patterns of receptor binding may reflect different receptor density gradients along pyramidal cell dendrites.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Transient patterns of GAP-43 expression during the formation of barrels in the rat <BrainRegion>somatosensory cortex</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The development of the rat <BrainRegion>barrel field cortex</BrainRegion> was investigated with an antibody to the axonal membrane-specific phosphoprotein GAP-43 in order to examine the developmental pattern of afferent projections, and with cytochrome oxidase histochemistry and Nissl stains to reveal the morphogenesis of <BrainRegion>cortical barrels</BrainRegion>. On the first two days after birth, GAP-43 immunostaining in the <BrainRegion>cortical plate</BrainRegion> was light and diffuse, then became intense in the presumptive layer IV of the <BrainRegion>parietal cortex</BrainRegion> on PND3 (day of birth = PND0). Immunoreactive densities were visible as small, focal patches within the centers of prospective barrels. These densities increased in size and intensity over the next few days and then diminished abruptly. On PND7, the distribution of GAP-43 was coextensive with barrels, as defined by cytochrome oxidase histochemistry and Nissl staining. GAP-43 virtually disappeared from the barrels after PND7. From the second postnatal week, GAP-43 immunostaining was evident in the septa between barrels and in the dysgranular regions of <BrainRegion>SI cortex</BrainRegion>. This pattern of GAP-43 distribution was complementary to the pattern of cytochrome oxidase activity, and persisted into maturity. In an attempt to identify possible source(s) of GAP-43 positive afferents in the developing barrels, we examined the effects of altering the sensory periphery on the distribution of GAP-43 immunostaining in the <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion>. Rat pups had row C whiskers cauterized on PND0 and were sacrificed on PND3 or PND5. Whereas immunopositive densities corresponding to intact whiskers developed in a normal, punctate pattern, <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> representation of the lesioned whiskers formed a continuous band of labeling that was evident as early as PND3. We argue that the disjunctive expression of GAP-43 in the barrel field reflects the pattern of distribution of afferents (most likely from the <BrainRegion>ventro-basal thalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>) to the <BrainRegion>barrel field cortex</BrainRegion>, and that this pattern may be instructive in the formation of barrels as cytoarchitectonic units. The rapid alteration in patterns of immunostaining following whisker lesions lends further support to the conclusion that the &quot;barrel template" is conveyed to the neocortex by incoming afferents. The possible significance of the transient expression of GAP-43 in the maturing barrel field is discussed.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Analysis of cell death in the <BrainRegion>trochlear nucleus</BrainRegion> of the chick embryo: calibration of the optical disector counting method reveals systematic bias.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Detection of changes in numbers of neurons is essential for an understanding of neuronal development, function, and death. Optical disector counting is claimed to be the most efficient technique to estimate accurate numbers of neurons in microscopic sections. We calibrated the optical disector by comparison with three-dimensional reconstructions from serial sections and determined how accurate this technique is relative to conventional profile counting methods. The calibration was performed on the <BrainRegion>trochlear nucleus</BrainRegion> in developing chicks. Optical disector estimates, when obtained as generally recommended, were about 25% lower than the actual number of neurons. This underestimate was caused by a nonuniform (bimodal) distribution of neuronal nuclei in paraffin and plastic (glycolmethacrylate) sections, but not in cryosections. The density of neurons in the core of the paraffin and plastic sections was substantially lower than in the upper and lower margins of these sections. Accurate estimates of neuronal numbers were obtained with a modified optical disector method that sampled the entire extent of tissue sections. Previous estimates of numbers of <BrainRegion>trochlear</BrainRegion> neurons in the developing chick have been controversial. The modified (calibrated) optical disector method revealed that the number of <BrainRegion>trochlear</BrainRegion> neurons decreased from about 1,600 at day 8.5 of incubation (embryonic day, [E] 8.5) to about 900 at the time of hatching. Numbers of pyknotic nuclei peaked at E6 and at E9, revealing an additional early, but postproliferative, period of cell death. Taken together, these data emphasize the need for calibration of stereological counting techniques and the need to examine sampling strategies for potential bias.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Hyperthermic induction of the 27-kDa heat shock protein (Hsp27) in neuroglia and neurons of the rat central nervous system.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The 27-kDa heat shock protein (Hsp27) is constitutively expressed in many neurons of the <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>, is strongly induced in glial cells in response to ischemia, seizures, or spreading depression, and is selectively induced in neurons after axotomy. Here, the expression of Hsp27 was examined in brains of adult rats from 1.5 hours to 6 days after brief hyperthermic stress (core body temperature of 42 degrees C for 15 minutes). Twenty-four hours following hyperthermia, Western blot analysis showed that Hsp27 was elevated in the <BrainRegion>cerebral cortex</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>cerebellum</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion>. Immunohistochemistry for Hsp27 revealed a time-dependent, but transient, increase in the level of Hsp27 immunoreactivity (Hsp27 IR) in neuroglia and neurons. Hsp27 immunoreactivity(Hsp27 IR) was detected in astrocytes throughout the brain and in Bergmann glia of the <BrainRegion>cerebellum</BrainRegion> from 3 hours to 6 days following heat shock. Peak levels were apparent at 24 hours, gradually declining thereafter. In addition, increases in Hsp27 immunoreactivity(Hsp27 IR) were detected in the <BrainRegion>ependyma</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>choroid plexus</BrainRegion>. Hyperthermia induced Hsp27 immunoreactivity(Hsp27 IR) in neurons of the <BrainRegion>subfornical organ</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>area postrema</BrainRegion> within 3 hours and reached a maximum by 24 hours with a return to control levels 4-6 days after hyperthermia. Specific populations of hypothalamic neurons also showed Hsp27 immunoreactivity(Hsp27 IR) after hyperthermia. These results demonstrate that hyperthermia induces transient expression of Hsp27 in several types of neuroglia and specific populations of neurons. The pattern of induced Hsp27 immunoreactivity(Hsp27 IR) suggests that some of the activated cells are involved in physiological responses related to body fluid homeostasis and temperature regulation.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>The <BrainRegion>tectopontine</BrainRegion> projection the the rat with comments on visual pathways to the <BrainRegion>basilar pons</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The projection from the <BrainRegion>superior and inferior colliculi</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>basilar pons</BrainRegion> in the rat was studied with the technique of orthograde transport of labeled amino acids and autoradiography. Injections restricted to the <BrainRegion>medial or lateral regions of the superior colliculus</BrainRegion> gave rise to grain labeling representing terminal fields over the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral peduncular, dorsolateral, and ventrolateral regions of the caudal basilar pons</BrainRegion> and over the <BrainRegion>dorsomedial area of the contralateral nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis</BrainRegion> (NRTP). The <BrainRegion>pontine</BrainRegion> projection from the <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>lateral basilar pons</BrainRegion> is topographically organized; the <BrainRegion>medial superior colliculus</BrainRegion> projects primarily to the <BrainRegion>peduncular region</BrainRegion>, whereas the <BrainRegion>lateral superior colliculus</BrainRegion> terminates chiefly in <BrainRegion>ventrolateral pontine areas</BrainRegion>. A projection from the <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>contralateral dorsomedial pontine</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>medial peduncular pontine</BrainRegion> regions, a previously undescribed finding, has also been shown. Descending fibers from the <BrainRegion>inferior colliculus</BrainRegion> do not appear to terminate extensively within the <BrainRegion>basilar pons</BrainRegion> but rather course adjacent to <BrainRegion>pontine</BrainRegion> cells of the <BrainRegion>dorsolateral region</BrainRegion> in the <BrainRegion>caudal pons</BrainRegion>. <BrainRegion>Pretectal nuclei</BrainRegion> project ipsilaterally to <BrainRegion>medial and lateral nuclei in the rostral and middle basilar pons</BrainRegion>, respectively. A rostrocaudal topography exists in the <BrainRegion>tectopontine</BrainRegion> projection; the <BrainRegion>pretectum</BrainRegion> projects to <BrainRegion>rostromiddle basilar pons</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion> to more <BrainRegion>caudal pontine regions</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>inferior colliculus</BrainRegion> (although sparsely) to further caudal areas. The <BrainRegion>pontine</BrainRegion> projection pattern from the <BrainRegion>colliculi</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>pretectum</BrainRegion> differs from the <BrainRegion>pontine</BrainRegion> afferents from the <BrainRegion>visual cortices</BrainRegion>. The findings of this study, when compared to our results from previous investigations on the <BrainRegion>pontocerebellar</BrainRegion> projection system, suggest that the <BrainRegion>tectal</BrainRegion> inputs to certain <BrainRegion>lateral cerebellar lobules</BrainRegion> are relayed primarily through <BrainRegion>nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis</BrainRegion>(NRTP) rather than the <BrainRegion>basilar pons</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>collicular</BrainRegion> projection to <BrainRegion>midvermal lobules of the cerebellum</BrainRegion> appear to be mediated in part by both <BrainRegion>nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis</BrainRegion>(NRTP) and <BrainRegion>lateral pontine nuclei</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Postnatal development of the feline <BrainRegion>lateral cervical nucleus</BrainRegion>: I. A quantitative light and electron microscopic study.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>With the aim of obtaining some basic information for future developmental studies, the <BrainRegion>lateral cervical nucleus</BrainRegion> (LCN) was investigated in 32 kittens of different ages by electron microscopic and stereologic methods. Corresponding light microscopic measurements of neuronal and nuclear profiles and of the total <BrainRegion>lateral cervical nucleus</BrainRegion>(LCN) volume were also performed. The total <BrainRegion>lateral cervical nucleus</BrainRegion>(LCN) volume increased sixfold between the ages of 12 hours and 120 days, the most rapid increase occurring during the first month. The neuronal size was fairly constant up to the age of 9 days, whereafter it showed greater variation. The mean profile area increased rapidly during the second week and then more slowly. The relative volume of boutons increased significantly between birth and the age of 34 days and then decreased slightly up to 120 days postnatally. The total bouton volume showed a steady increase, which was most pronounced between the ages of 9 and 34 days. The relative dendritic volume decreased during the 120 days of observation, whereas the total volume of dendrites increased up to the age of 92 days and then decreased. The total volume of glial cells increased during the 120-day observation period, as did both the relative and total volumes of myelinated axons. The changes in the relative volumes of mitochondria in boutons and dendrites were very similar, with increases that were most marked between the ages of 9 and 34 days and between 92 and 120 days.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Location of <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> ganglion cells contributing to the early imprecision in the retinotopic order of the developing projection to the <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion> of the wallaby (Macropus eugenii).</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The position of ganglion cells contributing to the early imprecision in retinotopic order in the developing retinocollicular projection in the wallaby (Macropus eugenii) has been determined. Deposits of horseradish peroxidase conjugated to wheat germ agglutinin (WGA-HRP) were made in the caudal pole of the <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion> (SC) at ages ranging from 22 days after birth, when sparse <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> axons have only just reached the <BrainRegion>caudal pole of the superior colliculus</BrainRegion>(SC) and are yet to cover its surface completely, to 96 days when the retinotopy of ganglion cell terminals in the <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion>(SC) is precise (Marotte, &apos;90). From 30 days onwards, the deposit of WGA-HRP resulted in a dense patch of retrogradely labelled <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> ganglion cells that could be seen to be appropriately positioned in <BrainRegion>nasal retina</BrainRegion>. However, at all ages prior to 92 days, there were inappropriately positioned labelled cells between the densely labelled patch and the <BrainRegion>central retina</BrainRegion> and both dorsal and ventral to the patch. They were not found in far distant regions of <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> and composed a relatively small proportion of labelled cells. They reached a peak at 45 days, had decreased to low levels by 63 days, were rare by 81 days, and by 92 days were absent. This latter age fits with the time when retinotopy was judged to be precise in a previous study (Marotte, &apos;90). Inappropriately projecting cells never originate from the entire <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> but only from regions adjacent to the appropriate region. Thus, during development there are no gross projection errors. Initially, ganglion cell axons are distributed on the <BrainRegion>colliculus</BrainRegion> in a coarse retinotopy. Refinement of the projection then follows, revealed by this technique as a loss of inappropriately projecting ganglion cells. This is complete by 92 days well before eye opening at around 140 days.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Neurochemical characterization of extrinsic innervation of the guinea pig rectum.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The presence of markers for parasympathetic, sympathetic, and glutamatergic or peptidergic sensory innervation was investigated by using in vitro tracing with biotinamide, combined with immunohistochemistry, to characterise quantitatively extrinsic axons to myenteric ganglia of the guinea pig rectum. Of biotinamide-filled varicose axons, 3.6 +/- 1.3% were immunoreactive for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and 16.0 +/- 4.8% for vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT). tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) and vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT1) showed high coexistence (83-100%), indicating that varicosities lacking tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) immunoreactivity also lacked VMAT1. vesicular acetylcholine transporter(VAChT) was detectable in 77% of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)-immunoreactive varicosities. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) was detected in 5.3 +/- 1.6% of biotinamide-labeled varicosities, the vesicular glutamate transporter (VGluT) 1 in 2.8 +/- 0.8%, and vesicular glutamate transporter(VGluT) 2 in 11.3 +/- 4.2% of varicosities of extrinsic origin. Varicosities from the same axon showed consistent immunoreactivity. A novel type of nerve ending was identified, with branching, flattened lamellar endings, similar to the intraganglionic laminar endings (IGLEs) of the proximal gut. Rectal intraganglionic laminar endings(IGLEs) were frequently immunoreactive for vesicular glutamate transporter(VGluT) 1 and vesicular glutamate transporter(VGluT) 2. Thus most varicose axons of extrinsic origin, which innervate rectal myenteric ganglia, lack detectable levels of immunoreactivity for tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) , VMAT1, vesicular acetylcholine transporter(VAChT) , choline acetyltransferase(ChAT) , vesicular glutamate transporter(VGluT) 1/2, or Calcitonin gene-related peptide(CGRP) , under conditions in which these markers are readily detectable in other axons. Although some unlabeled varicosities may belong to afferent axons that lack detectable Calcitonin gene-related peptide(CGRP) or vesicular glutamate transporter(VGluT) 1/2 in the periphery, this suggests that a large proportion of axons do not release any of the major autonomic or sensory transmitters. We speculate that this may vary under particular circumstances, for example, inflammation or obstruction of the gut.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Differences in developmental cell death between somatic and autonomic motor neurons of rat <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Considerable knowledge concerning developmental cell death has come from the study of somatic motor neurons (SMNs), but a related set of <BrainRegion>spinal</BrainRegion> neurons, the autonomic motor neurons (AMNs), have been studied less extensively in this respect. In the present study, we used three different approaches to determine the amount of AMN cell death during normal development in the rat. First, target dependency was studied in organotypic slice cultures, and it was found that autonomic motor neurons(AMNs) survived for at least 12 days after removal of their postsynaptic targets. No factors were added to the serum-free medium to substitute for the ablated targets, indicating that autonomic motor neurons(AMNs) were able to survive without target-derived trophic factors. Such target-independent survival is not characteristic of neurons that undergo typical developmental cell death. Second, autonomic motor neurons(AMNs) were counted in double-stained choline acetyltransferase immunocytochemical and NADPH diaphorase histochemical preparations at ages (postnatal days 4-22) encompassing the period when AMN postsynaptic target cells undergo developmental death. Neuron numbers were essentially identical at all ages examined, indicating that no AMN cell death occurred postnatally. Finally, from embryonic day 13 to postnatal day 22, animals were analyzed by using terminal transferase-mediated nick-end labeling to identify dying cells. Many fewer labeled cells were observed among autonomic motor neurons(AMNs) than among somatic motor neurons(SMNs) . Thus, all three approaches indicated that there is a significant SMN/AMN difference in developmental cell death. The phenotypic trait(s) that underlies this difference may also be important in the relative resistance of autonomic motor neurons(AMNs) to pathological conditions that induce death of somatic motor neurons(SMNs) , e.g., those involved in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and excitotoxicity.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>The locust wing hinge stretch receptors. II. Variation, alternative pathways and &quot;mistakes" in the central arborizations.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The central arborizations of the stretch receptor (SR) neurones are very consistent from one individual to another. Superimposition of normalized neurones from eight individuals of Locusta show very little variation even in the detailed branching pattern. There is, however, a commonly found alternative course for the main medial branch in the metathoracic ganglion. Rare, radical departures from the normal branching pattern are termed &quot;mistakes." Only three have been found, all in the forewing stretch receptor(SR) projection, one with an extra branch and two with missing branches. Terminals of twigs in the alternative region of the medial branch occupy consistent positions in the neuropile, although these are reached by different routes. Mistakes have terminals in areas normally containing stretch receptor(SR) endings. Both these findings suggest that there may be labelled sites in the neuropile which the growing tips of the stretch receptor(SR) neurones seek out.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Development of catecholamine systems in the central nervous system of the newt Pleurodeles waltlii as revealed by tyrosine hydroxylase immunohistochemistry.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The aim of the present study was to extend our knowledge of the development of catecholamine (CA) systems in the class of amphibians to the order of urodeles. In contrast to previous studies of urodeles, the present study with antisera against tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine revealed that catecholamine(CA) systems are already present at early embryonic stages of the newt, Pleurodeles waltlii. Although the development from fertilized egg to juvenile in the urodele Pleurodeles lasts twice as long as that in the anuran, Xenopus laevis, and shows less dramatic changes in external morphology, the spatiotemporal sequence of appearance of tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) -immunoreactive cell groups is rather similar. An early appearance of tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) -immunoreactive cell bodies occurs in the <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>posterior tubercle</BrainRegion>, the accompanying cell group of the hypothalamic <BrainRegion>periventricular organ</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>locus coeruleus</BrainRegion>, an area immediately ventral to the <BrainRegion>central canal of the spinal cord</BrainRegion>, and in the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>. Somewhat later, immunoreactive cells are detected in the <BrainRegion>posterior thalamic nucleus</BrainRegion> and in the <BrainRegion>rostral portion of the midbrain tegmentum</BrainRegion>, whereas the preoptic cell group is the last one to become tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) immunoreactive. The presence of catecholamine(CA) systems at early embryonic stages of both anurans and urodeles suggests that these systems are already of functional significance early in development. The maturation of catecholamine(CA) neuronal structures in the <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> circuitries, which takes place during development earlier in amphibians than in mammals, supports that notion.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Neurotrophin receptor mRNA expression defines distinct populations of neurons in rat dorsal root ganglia.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The biological actions of neurotrophins are mediated by specific neurotrophin receptor tyrosine kinases (Trks). A low-affinity nerve growth factor (NGF) receptor, p75, appears to modulate sensitivity to neurotrophins in some neuronal populations. It has been recently demonstrated that genes encoding members of the Trk family are expressed in distinct patterns in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG; Mu et al. [1993] (J. Neurosci. 13:4029- 4041). However, the extent to which different neurotrophin receptor genes are coexpressed by individual dorsal root ganglia(DRG) neurons is unknown. The question of coexpression is important since the expression of more than one member of the trk family by dorsal root ganglia(DRG) neurons would suggest the potential for regulation by multiple neurotrophins. To address this question, a combination of isotopic and colorimetric in situ hybridization was performed on rat thoracic dorsal root ganglia(DRG) using riboprobes specific for trkA, trkB, trkC, and p75. We show here that neurons that express trkA are largely distinct from those that express trkC, although there is a small subpopulation that expresses both of these genes. We also show that there is a distinct population of dorsal root ganglia(DRG) neurons that expresses trkB and does not coexpress either trkA or trkC. P75 is expressed in almost all neurons that express trkA or trkB, but is coexpressed in only 50% of trkC-expressing neurons. Importantly, p75 is not expressed in dorsal root ganglia(DRG) neurons independent of trk expression. Finally, a subpopulation of dorsal root ganglia(DRG) neurons does not express any of the neurotrophin receptor mRNAs. Our results demonstrate that there are distinct populations of dorsal root ganglia(DRG) neurons that express each member of the neurotrophin receptor tyrosine kinase family. Our findings of extensive colocalization of p75 with trkA and trkB lend support to the idea that p75 is important in mediating the actions of nerve growth factor(NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor on dorsal root ganglia(DRG) neurons. Interestingly, however, p75 expression is clearly unimportant for a subpopulation of neurons that require neurotrophin-3. The fact that p75 is not expressed in the absence of trkA, trkB, or trkC suggests that the function of p75 is closely related to functions of the known neurotrophin-receptor tyrosine kinases. Finally, our results suggest that a significant percentage of dorsal root ganglia(DRG) neurons may be regulated by non-neurotrophin neuronal growth factors.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Aging of the nigrostriatal system in the squirrel monkey.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Increasing incidence of Parkinson&apos;s disease with advancing age suggests that age-related processes predispose the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system to neurodegeneration. Several hypotheses concerning the effects of aging on nigrostriatal neurons were assessed in this study using a non-human primate model. First, we examined the possibility that the total number of dopaminergic neurons decline in the <BrainRegion>substantia nigra</BrainRegion> as a function of age. Stereological counting based on both tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity (TH-ir) and neuromelanin (NM) content revealed no difference in cell number between young, middle-aged and old squirrel monkeys. We then determined whether advancing age changed the relative proportion of neurons characterized by 1) tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity(TH-ir) in the absence of neuromelanin(NM) , 2) the presence of both tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity(TH-ir) and neuromelanin(NM) , or 3) neuromelanin(NM) without tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity(TH-ir) . Indeed, a progressive age-related depletion of TH only cells was paralleled by an increase in neuromelanin(NM) only neurons. The possibility that these changes could underlie a functional impairment of the nigrostriatal system was supported by <BrainRegion>striatal</BrainRegion> dopamine measurements showing a decrease in older monkeys. Finally, we tested the hypotheses that aging may enhance cell vulnerability to injury and that different dopaminergic subpopulations display varying degrees of susceptibility. When monkeys were exposed to the neurotoxicant 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine, cell loss was markedly more pronounced in older animals, and the ranking of vulnerability was TH only &amp;lt; TH/ neuromelanin(NM) &lt; neuromelanin(NM) only cells. The data indicate that, even in the absence of an overall neuronal loss, changes in the characteristics of dopaminergic cells reflect functional deficits and increased vulnerability to injury with age. neuromelanin(NM) content appears to be an important marker of these age-related effects.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Trigeminal nuclear complex</BrainRegion> of the ferret: anatomical and immunohistochemical studies.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>In order to establish the ferret as an animal model for studies of trigeminal pain, we describe the cytoarchitecture and neurochemistry of the <BrainRegion>trigeminal nuclear complex</BrainRegion> in the ferret and compare them to those of the cat and rat. The complex was divided as previously described, but the ferret differed in the extent of the nuclear boundaries. The neuroanatomical istribution of substance P-, calcitonin gene-related peptide-, galanin-, enkephalin-, serotonin-, somatostatin-, neuropeptide Y-, and neurotensin-immunoreactivity was determined throughout the rostrocaudal extent of the complex. In <BrainRegion>subnucleus caudalis</BrainRegion>, substance P-, calcitonin gene-related peptide-, enkephalin-, serotonin-, somatostatin-, neuropeptide Y-, and galanin-immunoreactivity was densest in laminae I and II. In <BrainRegion>subnucleus interpolaris</BrainRegion>, immunoreactivity for all the above neurochemicals was most dense along the lateral border and the ventral third of the caudal part of the subnucleus. Enkephalin-immunoreactive cell bodies were present in <BrainRegion>subnucleus caudalis and interpolaris</BrainRegion>. In <BrainRegion>subnucleus oralis</BrainRegion>, labelling for substance P, calcitonin gene-related peptide, galanin, enkephalin, and serotonin was most prominent in the dorsomedial part of the subnucleus. Somatostatin-immunoreactive cell bodies were distributed throughout the <BrainRegion>spinal nucleus</BrainRegion>. Labelling of serotonin, substance P, calcitonin gene-related peptide, galanin, enkephalin, and somatostatin was present in the main sensory nucleus. The motor nucleus contained fibers immunoreactive for substance P, enkephalin, serotonin and neuropeptide Y, and cell bodies immunoreactive for calcitonin gene-related peptide. The majority of neurotensin-immunoreactivity was found at the level of <BrainRegion>subnucleus caudalis</BrainRegion>, where it was densest in the trigeminal extension of the <BrainRegion>lateral cervical nucleus</BrainRegion>. The distribution of peptides in this species throughout the <BrainRegion>spinal nucleus</BrainRegion> is consistent with the notion that all the subnuclei may be involved in the processing of nociceptive inputs.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Thalamic</BrainRegion> projections to the <BrainRegion>lateral suprasylvian visual area</BrainRegion> in cats with neonatal or adult <BrainRegion>visual cortex</BrainRegion> damage.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Previous transneuronal anterograde tracing studies have shown that the retino-thalamic pathway to the <BrainRegion>posteromedial lateral suprasylvian</BrainRegion> (PMLS) <BrainRegion>visual area of cortex</BrainRegion> is heavier than normal in adult cats that received neonatal damage to <BrainRegion>visual cortical areas 17, 18, and 19</BrainRegion>. In contrast, the strength of this projection does not appear to differ from that in normal animals in cats that experienced <BrainRegion>visual cortex</BrainRegion> damage as adults. In the present study, we used retrograde tracing methods to identify the <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> cells that project to the <BrainRegion>posteromedial lateral suprasylvian(PMLS) cortex</BrainRegion> in adult cats that had received a lesion of <BrainRegion>visual cortex</BrainRegion> during infancy or adulthood. In five kittens, a unilateral <BrainRegion>visual cortex</BrainRegion> lesion was made on the day of birth, and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was injected into the <BrainRegion>posteromedial lateral suprasylvian(PMLS) cortex</BrainRegion> of both hemispheres when the animals were 10.5 to 13 months old. For comparison, horseradish peroxidase(HRP) was injected bilaterally into the <BrainRegion>posteromedial lateral suprasylvian(PMLS) cortex</BrainRegion> of three cats 6.5 to 13.5 months after they received a similar unilateral <BrainRegion>visual cortex</BrainRegion> lesion as adults. In cats with a neonatal lesion, retrograde labeling was found in the large neurons that survive in the otherwise degenerated layers A and A1 of the <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion> (LGN) ipsilateral to the lesion. Retrograde labeling of A-layer neurons was not seen in the undamaged hemisphere of these animals or in either hemisphere of animals that had received a lesion as adults. As in normal adult cats, retrograde labeling also was present in the C layers of the <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(LGN) , the <BrainRegion>medial interlaminar nucleus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>posterior nucleus of Rioch</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>lateral posterior nucleus</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>pulvinar nucleus</BrainRegion> ipsilateral to a neonatal or adult lesion. Quantitative estimates indicate that the number of labeled cells is much larger than normal in the C layers of the <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(LGN) ipsilateral to a neonatal <BrainRegion>visual cortex</BrainRegion> lesion. Thus the results indicate that the heavier than normal projection from the <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion> to <BrainRegion>posteromedial lateral suprasylvian(PMLS) cortex</BrainRegion> that exists in adult cats after neonatal <BrainRegion>visual cortex</BrainRegion> damage arises, at least in part, from surviving <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(LGN) neurons in the A and C layers of the <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(LGN) . Although several <BrainRegion>thalamic nuclei</BrainRegion>, as well as the C layers of the <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(LGN) , continue to project to <BrainRegion>posteromedial lateral suprasylvian(PMLS) cortex</BrainRegion> after an adult <BrainRegion>visual cortex</BrainRegion> lesion, these projections appear not to be affected significantly by the lesion.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Synaptic relationships of Golgi type II cells in the <BrainRegion>medial geniculate body</BrainRegion> of the cat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>A combined analysis with the Golgi and silver-degeneration methods and electron microscopy in the <BrainRegion>ventral nucleus of the medial geniculate body</BrainRegion> has confirmed that the Golgi type II neuron forms dendro-dendritic synapses with the principal neuron in terminal aggregates called synaptic nests. Both types of neurons receive synaptic contacts from the afferent axons that ascend from the <BrainRegion>posterior colliculus</BrainRegion> and from those that descend from the <BrainRegion>auditory cortex</BrainRegion>. Only the principal neuron projects to the <BrainRegion>auditory cortex</BrainRegion>. The Golgi type II cells that receive endings from afferent axons send presynaptic processes to principal cells that are also contacted by the very same afferent axons. The axons of Golgi type II cells project to synaptic nests other than those supplied by the dendrites of the parent cell and link the Golgi type II cells with each other. On the surface of the Golgi type II cell there is a segregation of the different types of synaptic endings and a consistent sequence in their synaptic relationships. The endings of colliculogeniculate and Golgi type II axons predominate on the distal dendrites in the synaptic nests. Corticogeniculate endings congregate more on the soma and proximal dendrites. In the synaptic nests the Golgi type II dendrites are presynaptic to the principal cell dendrites, whereas both kinds of dendrites are postsynaptic to the very same axons, which project either from the <BrainRegion>posterior colliculus</BrainRegion> or from Golgi II cells...</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Representation of whisker follicle intrinsic musculature in the <BrainRegion>facial motor nucleus</BrainRegion> of the rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Retrograde transport of wheatgerm-agglutinin horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) and fluorescent tracers (true blue-TB, nuclear yellow-NY, and diamidino yellow-DY) from isolated whisker follicles was used to define the somatotopic organization of the facial (VII) motoneurons which innervate the intrinsic follicle muscles. Motoneurons supplying these muscles were restricted almost completely to the lateral (Martin and Lodge, &apos;77) <BrainRegion>facial subnucleus</BrainRegion> and the motoneurons which innervated a given follicle were distributed over the entire length of this subnucleus. Cells projecting to dorsal (A-row) follicles were located in the most <BrainRegion>lateral part of the lateral subnucleus</BrainRegion>, while those supplying ventral (E-row) follicles were restricted to the <BrainRegion>medial part of the subnucleus</BrainRegion>. Injections of different tracers into rostral and caudal follicles within a given row revealed no somatotopic representation of the rostrocaudal axis of the whiskerpad. Additional control experiments demonstrated that some of the labelling obtained with wheatgerm-agglutinin horseradish peroxidase(WGA-HRP) resulted from spread of this tracer to extrinsic muscles. This was not the case with the fluorescent tracers. The results of the control experiments suggested further that a significant percentage of the motoneurons in the <BrainRegion>lateral facial subnucleus</BrainRegion> innervate only intrinsic follicle muscles.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>A three-dimensional atlas of <BrainRegion>pituitary gland</BrainRegion> development in the zebrafish.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The pituitary gland is unique to Chordates, with significant variation within this group, offering an excellent opportunity to increase insight into phylogenetic relationships within this phylum. The structure of the <BrainRegion>pituitary</BrainRegion> in adult Teleosts (class: Osteichthyes) is quite different from that in other chordates and is also variable among members of the class. Therefore, a complete description of the structure and development of the <BrainRegion>pituitary</BrainRegion> in members of this class is a critical component to our overall understanding of this gland. An obvious teleost model organism is the zebrafish, Danio rerio, as a significant amount of work has been done on the molecular control of <BrainRegion>pituitary</BrainRegion> development in this fish. However, very little work has been published on the morphological development of the <BrainRegion>pituitary</BrainRegion> in the zebrafish; the present study aims to fill this void. The <BrainRegion>pituitary</BrainRegion> develops from cells on the rostrodorsal portion of the head and reaches its final position, <BrainRegion>ventral to the hypothalamus</BrainRegion>, as the cephalic flexure occurs and the jaws and mouth form. The <BrainRegion>pituitary placode</BrainRegion> is juxtaposed to cells that will form the olfactory vesicles, the stomodeum, and the hatching gland. The volume of the <BrainRegion>pituitary</BrainRegion> is greatest at 24 hours post fertilization (hpf). From 24 to 120 hours post fertilization(hpf) , the <BrainRegion>pituitary</BrainRegion> decreases in height and width as it undergoes convergent extension, increasing in length with the axis. The adenohypophysis is a morphologically distinct structure by 24 hours post fertilization(hpf) , whereas the neurohypophysis remains indistinct until 72 hours post fertilization(hpf) . The findings of this study correlate well with the available molecular data.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Telencephalic</BrainRegion> connections in lizards. II. Projections to <BrainRegion>anterior dorsal ventricular ridge</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Three distinct cytoarchitectonic regions were identified within the <BrainRegion>anterior dorsal ventricular ridge</BrainRegion> (ADVR) of two species of lizards, Gekko gecko and Iguana iguana. These regions have been named according to their general topographical positions: <BrainRegion>medial area</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>caudolateral area</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>rostrolateral area</BrainRegion>. Injections of horseradish peroxidase throughout the <BrainRegion>anterior dorsal ventricular ridge</BrainRegion>(ADVR) demonstrated that each of the three areas of the <BrainRegion>anterior dorsal ventricular ridge</BrainRegion>(ADVR) receives projections from specific <BrainRegion>thalamic nuclei</BrainRegion> which are associated with specific sensory modalities. The <BrainRegion>medial area</BrainRegion> receives an <BrainRegion>auditory thalamic</BrainRegion> projection from <BrainRegion>nucleus medialis</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>caudolateral area</BrainRegion> receives <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> projections from <BrainRegion>nucleus medialis posterior</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>nucleus posterocentralis</BrainRegion>. The latter two nuclei were shown to receive projections from the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> and, therefore, are presumed to be associated with body somatosensory information. The <BrainRegion>rostrolateral area</BrainRegion> receives a <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> projection from <BrainRegion>nucleus rotundus</BrainRegion>, which receives visual information. In addition, the <BrainRegion>mesencephalic tegmentum</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>thalamic nucleus dorsomedialis</BrainRegion> project to the entire <BrainRegion>anterior dorsal ventricular ridge</BrainRegion>(ADVR) . The latter projection is similar to the diffuse <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> projections of the <BrainRegion>intralaminar thalamic nuclei</BrainRegion> in mammals. These findings support previous suggestions that the <BrainRegion>anterior dorsal ventricular ridge</BrainRegion>(ADVR) is comparable to sensory regions of the mammalian <BrainRegion>neocortex</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Pore-forming subunits of K-ATP channels, Kir6.1 and Kir6.2, display prominent differences in regional and cellular distribution in the rat brain.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>K-ATP channels consist of two structurally different subunits: a pore-forming subunit of the Kir6.0-family (Kir6.1 or Kir6.2) and a sulfonylurea receptor (SUR1, SUR2, SUR2A, SUR2B) with regulatory activity. The functional diversity of K-ATP channels in brain is broad and of fundamental importance for neuronal activity. Here, using immunocytochemistry with monospecific antibodies against the Kir6.1 and Kir6.2 subunits, we analyze the regional and cellular distribution of both proteins in the adult rat brain. We find Kir6.2 to be widely expressed in all brain regions, suggesting that the Kir6.2 subunit forms the pore of the K-ATP channels in most neurons, presumably protecting the cells during cellular stress conditions such as hypoglycemia or ischemia. Especially in <BrainRegion>hypothalamic nuclei</BrainRegion>, in particular the <BrainRegion>ventromedial and arcuate nucleus</BrainRegion>, neurons display Kir6.2 immunoreactivity only, suggesting that Kir6.2 is the pore-forming subunit of the K-ATP channels in the glucose-responsive neurons of the <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion>. In contrast, Kir6.1-like immunolabeling is restricted to astrocytes (Thomzig et al. [2001] Mol Cell Neurosci 18:671-690) in most areas of the rat brain and very weak or absent in neurons. Only in distinct nuclei or neuronal subpopulations is a moderate or even strong Kir6.1 staining detected. The biological functions of these K-ATP channels still need to be elucidated.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Monosynaptic projections from the <BrainRegion>nucleus tractus solitarii</BrainRegion> to C1 adrenergic neurons in the <BrainRegion>rostral ventrolateral medulla</BrainRegion>: comparison with input from the <BrainRegion>caudal ventrolateral medulla</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The <BrainRegion>rostral ventrolateral medulla</BrainRegion> (RVL) contains <BrainRegion>reticulospinal</BrainRegion> adrenergic (C1) neurons that are thought to be sympathoexcitatory and that form the <BrainRegion>medullary</BrainRegion> efferent limb of the baroreceptor reflex pathway. The <BrainRegion>rostral ventrolateral medulla</BrainRegion>(RVL) receives direct projections from two important autonomic regions, the <BrainRegion>caudal ventrolateral medulla</BrainRegion> (CVL) and the <BrainRegion>nucleus tractus solitarii</BrainRegion> with immunocytochemical identification of C1 adrenergic neurons in the <BrainRegion>rostral ventrolateral medulla</BrainRegion>(RVL) to compare the morphology of afferent input from these two autonomic regions into the <BrainRegion>rostral ventrolateral medulla</BrainRegion>(RVL) . <BrainRegion>NTS</BrainRegion> (n = 203) and <BrainRegion>caudal ventrolateral medulla</BrainRegion>(CVL) (n = 380) efferent terminals had similar morphology and vesicular content, but <BrainRegion>caudal ventrolateral medulla</BrainRegion>(CVL) efferent terminals were slightly larger than <BrainRegion>NTS</BrainRegion> efferent terminals. Overall, efferent terminals from either region were equally likely to contact adrenergic neurons in the <BrainRegion>rostral ventrolateral medulla</BrainRegion>(RVL) (21% for <BrainRegion>NTS</BrainRegion>, 25% for <BrainRegion>caudal ventrolateral medulla</BrainRegion>(CVL) ). Although efferents from both regions formed both symmetric and asymmetric synapses, <BrainRegion>NTS</BrainRegion> efferent terminals were statistically more likely to form asymmetric synapses than <BrainRegion>caudal ventrolateral medulla</BrainRegion>(CVL) efferent terminals. <BrainRegion>caudal ventrolateral medulla</BrainRegion>(CVL) efferent terminals were more likely to contact adrenergic somata than were <BrainRegion>NTS</BrainRegion> efferents, which usually contacted dendrites. These findings 1) support the hypothesis that a portion of <BrainRegion>NTS</BrainRegion> efferents to the <BrainRegion>rostral ventrolateral medulla</BrainRegion>(RVL) may be involved in sympathoexcitatory, e.g., chemoreceptor, reflexes (via asymmetric synapses), whereas those from the <BrainRegion>caudal ventrolateral medulla</BrainRegion>(CVL) mediate sympathoinhibition (via symmetric synapses); and 2) provide an anatomical substrate for differential postsynaptic modulation of C1 neurons by projections from the <BrainRegion>NTS</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>caudal ventrolateral medulla</BrainRegion>(CVL) . With their more frequent somatic localization, <BrainRegion>caudal ventrolateral medulla</BrainRegion>(CVL) inhibitory inputs may be more influential than excitatory <BrainRegion>NTS</BrainRegion> inputs in determining the discharge of <BrainRegion>rostral ventrolateral medulla</BrainRegion>(RVL) neurons.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Intrinsic connections in the <BrainRegion>anterior dorsal ventricular ridge</BrainRegion> of the lizard Psammodromus algirus.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>We have studied the intrinsic connections of the <BrainRegion>anterior dorsal ventricular ridge</BrainRegion> (ADVR) in the lacertid lizard Psammodromus algirus by means of retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and fluorescent labeling with the lipophilic carbocyanine dye DiI. We injected horseradish peroxidase(HRP) into different regions in the <BrainRegion>anterior dorsal ventricular ridge</BrainRegion>(ADVR) arrayed in a medial-to-lateral sequence, with each consisting of three distinct superficial-to-deep zones. When horseradish peroxidase(HRP) was injected into a given region, many labeled neurons (always located ipsilateral to the injection site) were found at all <BrainRegion>mediolateral regions of anterior dorsal ventricular ridge</BrainRegion>(ADVR) in locations rostrally distant from the injection site. DiI crystals were applied on different superficial-to-deep zones within each region. Two patterns could be recognized: DiI crystals applied on the periventricular (most superficial) zone resulted in a labeling of cells widely distributed throughout the <BrainRegion>anterior dorsal ventricular ridge</BrainRegion>(ADVR) independently of the mediolateral region of the application site, whereas DiI crystals applied on deeper zones resulted in a staining of cells mostly restricted to a narrow radial area. Results from both types of labeling confirm that the <BrainRegion>anterior dorsal ventricular ridge</BrainRegion>(ADVR) has a prominent radial component in its intrinsic organization, but they also demonstrate that some areas of the <BrainRegion>anterior dorsal ventricular ridge</BrainRegion>(ADVR) receive projections from distant, rostrally located neurons in every ipsilateral region of the ridge itself, which establishes a clear non-radial component. This organization may have important functional properties with regard to a putative integration of different sensory modalities conveyed by <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> afferent fibers to the <BrainRegion>anterior dorsal ventricular ridge</BrainRegion>(ADVR) . Last, we analyzed some evolutionary implications of our results.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>The emergence of compartmental organization in <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> glomeruli during postnatal development.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> glomerulus is a discrete and heterogeneous neuropil where olfactory receptor cell axons synapse with dendrites of mitral, tufted, and periglomerular neurons. To understand better the maturation of glomeruli and the spatiotemporal interactions that occur during postnatal development, we employed confocal microscopy and markers for immature and mature olfactory receptor cell axons in parallel with a marker for synaptic structure in maturing glomeruli. Sprague-Dawley rats at postnatal days 1, 6, 12, and 18 were processed for single- and double-label immunocytochemistry for olfactory marker protein (OMP), growth-associated protein (GAP-43), and synaptophysin. Mature or adult-like subcompartmental organization within the glomerulus emerged by postnatal day 12. Earlier in development immature axons entered the core of the glomerulus and moved to the periphery as they matured. However, beginning around 12 days postnatal, immature axons distributed in the periphery and moved toward the core as they matured. This change in the trajectories of axons into glomeruli suggests that different rules may be followed in establishing versus maintaining glomeruli. Double labeling with olfactory marker protein(OMP) and synaptophysin demonstrated strong colocalization compared with GAP-43 and synaptophysin, which showed much less colocalization, consistent with the notion that olfactory marker protein(OMP) is associated with more mature axons.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Topographic and cytoarchitectonic organization of <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> neurons related to their targets in low-, middle-, and high-frequency representations in cat <BrainRegion>auditory cortex</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>We studied the topographic organization of <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> projections upon different ranges of <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> frequency representation. <BrainRegion>Thalamic</BrainRegion> neurons were labeled by injecting horseradish peroxidase (HRP) or tritiated bovine serum albumin into <BrainRegion>auditory cortex</BrainRegion>. Injections in individual brains were confined to the same range of frequency representation, and distributed through three or four tonotopic <BrainRegion>cortical fields</BrainRegion> in order to label as much of the <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> projection upon a limited range of frequency representation as practicable. Low, middle, and high ranges of the frequency representation were injected in different brains. The spatial organizations of arrays of labeled neurons are described, and each array is divided into a ventral division and <BrainRegion>lateral posterior complex</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>lateral part of the posterior thalamic group</BrainRegion>), both composed mainly of small cells; and a medial division, composed mainly of medium and large cells. The ventral and medial divisions (located <BrainRegion>laterally and medially within the medial geniculate body</BrainRegion> (MGB), respectively), both contact the <BrainRegion>lateral posterior complex</BrainRegion> which is located rostrally. The horseradish peroxidase(HRP) cytoarchitecture of the three divisions is described, and the portions of the ventral division corresponding with the physiologically and cytoarchitectonically defined <BrainRegion>ventral nucleus</BrainRegion> are identified. Relatively few labeled neurons were found within other <BrainRegion>thalamic areas</BrainRegion>. The topographic organizations of the ventral division (and its tonotopic subdivision, the <BrainRegion>ventral nucleus</BrainRegion>), the <BrainRegion>lateral posterior complex</BrainRegion> (also tonotopically organized), and the medial division are described. There are planar and concentric components of the topographic organization in the <BrainRegion>ventral nucleus</BrainRegion>. Within the planar component, the low-frequency area is located laterally and the high-frequency area is located rostromedially. Within the concentric component, the low-frequency area is located centrally and the high-frequency area is located peripherally. Low-, middle-, and high-frequency areas course without interruption through the planar and concentric components. In the <BrainRegion>lateral posterior complex</BrainRegion>, the low-frequency area is located rostrally, and the high-frequency area is located caudally adjoining the high-frequency area in the <BrainRegion>ventral nucleus</BrainRegion>. The topographic organizations of the <BrainRegion>ventral nucleus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>lateral posterior complex</BrainRegion> are consistent with tonotopic maps of these regions. The medium- and large-cell portion of the medial division is also topographically organized, although there may be more overlap among low-, middle-, and high-frequency arrays than in the <BrainRegion>ventral nucleus</BrainRegion>.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Compartmental and topographical specificity of reinnervation of the glutaeus muscle in the adult toad (Bufo marinus).</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The extent to which the compartmental and topographical innervation patterns were re-established in the mature glutaeus muscle after nerve cut was determined by HRP retrograde labelling procedures and single motor unit glycogen depletion experiments. Glutaeus muscle axons normally cluster together along the length of the sciatic nerve and enter the triceps femoris nerve along with axons to the cruralis and tensor fasciae latae muscles. Glutaeus axons did not specifically reinnervate the glutaeus muscle after cutting the triceps femoris nerve. Axons within the glutaeus muscle nerve are grouped according to the primary nerve branch, and therefore muscle compartment, for which they are destined. When the glutaeus nerve was cut, regenerating axons lost their compartmental organization within the glutaeus nerve and nonspecifically reinnervated both glutaeus muscle compartments. In marked contrast, the topographical projection of spinal motoneurones to the ventral and dorsal halves of the glutaeus muscle was largely re-established after glutaeus nerve cut; that is, rostral motoneurones mostly reinnervated ventral muscle fibres, whereas caudal motoneurones reinnervated dorsally located muscle fibres. The relatively confined caudal projection was closely related to the sharp fibre type divisions within the glutaeus muscle. The results suggest that factor(s) present during development that determine the correct innervation of a muscle and its compartments no longer operate in the adult, although cues that direct motor terminals to their appropriate muscle region do, and these are most likely related to the topographical distribution of fibre types.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Distribution of motor neurons into anatomical groups in the grasshopper metathoracic ganglion.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Motor neurons of the main muscles of the hind legs and the hind wings of the grasshopper are distributed into eight anatomical groups within each half of a bilaterally symmetrical segmental ganglion. A group contains 5 to 24 identified motor neurons, accounting for 164 (82 pairs) of the some 200 motor neurons within the population. The motor neurons within a given group may contribute axons to more than one of the lateral nerves, and conversely each lateral nerve contains axons arising from motor neurons in separate groups. Groups may include synergistic and antagonistic motor neurons as well as those that have unrelated functions. The motor neurons of a given muscle may occur together in a single group, or separately in two or more groups. The description of groups provides a way of classifying neurons to simplify and organize the large amount of data on the structure and function of individually identified neurons within the ganglion. The organization of the motor neurons into groups may reflect their developmental origin from individual neuroblasts, and the detailed information about the pattern of groups in the adult thus allows specific predictions to be made about the composition of neurons within neuronal lineages.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Disruption of the gene encoding SF-1 alters the distribution of <BrainRegion>hypothalamic</BrainRegion> neuronal phenotypes.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The <BrainRegion>ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus</BrainRegion> (VMH) in mice first emerges as a histologically distinct cell cluster around embryonic day 17 (E17). The earliest known marker for cells destined to form the <BrainRegion>ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus</BrainRegion>(VMH) is the orphan nuclear receptor, steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1), which can be detected in the <BrainRegion>hypothalamic</BrainRegion> primordium by E11. Strikingly, the <BrainRegion>ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus</BrainRegion>(VMH) is absent in newborn steroidogenic factor 1(SF-1) knockout mice, suggesting that steroidogenic factor 1(SF-1) is essential for the development of <BrainRegion>ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus</BrainRegion>(VMH) neurons. We reported previously that the <BrainRegion>ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus</BrainRegion>(VMH) can be identified before it emerges as a histologically distinct nucleus (i.e., at E13) by the exclusion of cells that are immunoreactive for both gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and the synthetic enzyme, glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD67). Subsequently, by E15, the developing <BrainRegion>ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus</BrainRegion>(VMH) is demarcated further by cells that are immunoreactive for neuropeptide Y, estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha), and galanin. It is noteworthy that the normal exclusion of gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) from the developing <BrainRegion>ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus</BrainRegion>(VMH) is not seen in steroidogenic factor 1(SF-1) knockout mice, and cells that are immunoreactive for neuropeptide Y, estrogen receptor alpha(ERalpha) , and galanin also are distributed aberrantly in this region. Thus, the absence of steroidogenic factor 1(SF-1) profoundly affects the cellular architecture of the <BrainRegion>ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus</BrainRegion>(VMH) from early stages in its formation. These data suggest that, directly or indirectly, steroidogenic factor 1(SF-1) plays important roles in determining the distribution of cells in the <BrainRegion>mediobasal hypothalamus</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Direct observations of synapses between L-glutamate-immunoreactive boutons and identified spinocervical tract neurones in the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> of the cat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Four spinocervical tract cells in <BrainRegion>lumbosacral spinal cords</BrainRegion> of adult cats were physiologically characterized and intracellularly labelled with horseradish peroxidase. The neurones were examined with a light microscope and reconstructed. Selected regions were chosen for ultrastructural analysis. Thin sections were treated to reveal the presence of L-glutamate by using the postembedding immunogold method. Two antisera, which specifically recognise the presence of fixed glutamate in tissue, were used in the study. Somata, proximal, and distal dendrites of all four neurones received synaptic contacts from boutons which displayed an obvious immunogold reaction. These boutons formed between 35% and 48% of all synaptic contacts onto spinocervical tract cells. Glutamate-enriched boutons were associated with gold particle densities which were 2-3 times greater than the average densities associated with the surrounding neuropil. Their profiles had a mean diameter of 1.68 microns, contained round agranular synaptic vesicles, and formed asymmetrical synaptic junctions. However, not all boutons displaying these characteristics were enriched with glutamate. Immunogold studies of alternate thin sections, which were incubated with glutamate or GABA antiserum, demonstrated that synaptic boutons on spinocervical tract cells were either enriched with GABA or with glutamate and formed two separate populations which had distinct morphological characteristics. GABA-containing boutons contained irregularly shaped agranular vesicles and formed symmetrical synaptic junctions, whereas glutamate-enriched boutons corresponded to those described above. A further population of boutons, containing highly flattened vesicles, was not immunoreactive for GABA or glutamate. The evidence supports the idea that much of the excitatory transmission into the SCT is mediated by L-glutamate.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>High-resolution localization of clathrin assembly protein AP180 in the presynaptic terminals of mammalian neurons.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Synaptic vesicles (SVs) assemble at the presynaptic compartment through a clathrin-dependent mechanism that involves one or more assembly proteins (APs). The assembly protein AP180 is especially efficient at facilitating clathrin cage formation, but its precise ultrastructural localization in neurons is unknown. Using immunoelectron microscopy, we demonstrate the presynaptic localization of AP180 in axon terminals of rat <BrainRegion>cerebellar</BrainRegion> neurons. In contrast, the assembly protein AP2 was associated with both the presynaptic plasma membrane and the cytosolic side of the membrane at postsynaptic and extrasynaptic sites. Furthermore, ultrastructural analysis of primate <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> showed that AP180 immunoreactivity was preferentially and highly enriched at ribbon synapses, where glutamate is released tonically at high levels and rapid vesicle turnover is essential. To maintain functional synaptic transmission, neurotransmitter-filled Synaptic vesicles(SVs) must be readily available, and this requires proper reassembly of new vesicles. The expression of AP180, in addition to AP-2, in the clathrin-mediated endocytic pathway might add another level of control to SV reformation for efficient assembly of clathrin, effectively controlling the size of assembled vesicles and faithfully recovering SV-specific components.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Central projections of C4-C8 dorsal root ganglia in the rat studied by anterograde transport of WGA-HRP.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Injections of WGA-HRP were made in the rat C4-C8 dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) individually to study the central projections and their relations to each other. The main <BrainRegion>dorsal horn</BrainRegion> projections from these DRGs to the <BrainRegion>dorsal horn</BrainRegion> lamina II extended for about two segments rostrally and caudally to the injected DRG, whereas the projections to laminae I, III, and IV were less restricted rostrocaudally. Comparisons of the <BrainRegion>dorsal horn</BrainRegion> projections from the DRGs investigated indicated a tendency for a somatotopic organization, which was most prominent in lamina II. Labeled central branches from the C4-8 DRGs could be traced in the dorsal column as far caudally as 12-17 segments caudal to the level of entrance. Most of these fibers appeared to end in the <BrainRegion>medial dorsal horn</BrainRegion> base, including the <BrainRegion>column of Clarke</BrainRegion>. Labeling of primary afferents in the <BrainRegion>ventral horn</BrainRegion> generally extended for at least 3-4 segments rostral and caudal to the level of the injected DRG. Projections to the <BrainRegion>central cervical nucleus</BrainRegion> were most prominent from the C4 DRG and gradually became less prominent from the more caudal DRGs. Heavy projections to the <BrainRegion>cuneate nucleus</BrainRegion> (Cun) originated from the C7 and C8 DRG, whereas those from the C4-C6 DRGs were less extensive. The <BrainRegion>cuneate nucleus</BrainRegion>(Cun) projections from the different DRGs appeared to overlap, and the same was true for the projections to the <BrainRegion>external cuneate nucleus</BrainRegion>. Projections to the <BrainRegion>gracile nucleus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>vestibular nuclear complex</BrainRegion>, including <BrainRegion>nucleus X</BrainRegion>, and to <BrainRegion>trigeminal sensory nuclei</BrainRegion> were seen from all DRGs investigated.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Microtubule disorientation and axonal swelling in unmyelinated sensory axons during vincristine-induced painful neuropathy in rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Neuropathic pain accompanies peripheral nerve injury following a variety of insults including metabolic disorders, traumatic injury, and exposure to neurotoxins such as vincristine and taxol. Vincristine, a microtubule depolymerizing drug, produces a peripheral neuropathy in humans that is accompanied by painful paresthesias and dysesthesias (Sandler et al., [1969] Neurology 19:367-374; Holland et al. [1973] Cancer Res. 33:1258-1264). The recent development of an animal model of vincristine-induced neuropathy provides an opportunity to investigate mechanisms underlying this form of neuropathic pain. Systemic vincristine (100 microg/kg) produces hyperalgesia to mechanical stimuli during the second week of administration, which persists for more than a week (Aley et al. [1996] Neuroscience 73:259-265). To test the hypothesis that changes in microtubule structure in nociceptive sensory neurons accompany vincristine-induced hyperalgesia, we analyzed unmyelinated axons in saphenous nerves of vincristine-treated rats. This study constitutes the first quantitative ultrastructural analysis of the cytoskeleton of unmyelinated axons in peripheral nerve during neuropathic hyperalgesia. There was no evidence of unmyelinated fiber loss or a decrease in the number of microtubules per axons. There was, however, a significant decrease in microtubule density in unmyelinated axons from vincristine-treated rats. This decrease in microtubule density was due to a significant increase in the cross-sectional area of unmyelinated axons, suggesting swelling of axons. In addition, vincristine-treated axons had significantly fewer microtubules cut in cross-section and significantly more tangentially oriented microtubules per axon compared to controls. These results suggest that vincristine causes disorganization of the axonal microtubule cytoskeleton, as well as an increase in the caliber of unmyelinated sensory axons.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Localization and characterization of NPY/PYY receptors in rat <BrainRegion>frontoparietal cortex</BrainRegion> during development.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is present in most <BrainRegion>cerebrocortical areas</BrainRegion> during fetal and postnatal development. In the rat <BrainRegion>frontal cortex</BrainRegion>, a dense radial fiber network containing Neuropeptide Y(NPY) immunoreactivity is observed transiently as early as embryonic day 17 (E17) and disappears at the end of the first postnatal week. We have investigated the distribution of Neuropeptide Y(NPY) receptors in the <BrainRegion>frontoparietal cortex</BrainRegion> at 13 stages of development, from E15 fetuses to adults, by in vitro autoradiography, using (125)I-pPYY as a radioligand. Quantitative receptor density was measured through all <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> layers at each developmental stage. Pharmacological identification of (125)I-pPPY binding sites was made by competition experiments using p Neuropeptide Y(NPY) or [Leu(31),Pro(34)]p Neuropeptide Y(NPY) and p Neuropeptide Y(NPY) (13-36), as selective competitors for Y1 and Y2 receptors, respectively. Neuropeptide Y(NPY) receptors were first detected in the <BrainRegion>cerebral cortex</BrainRegion> at low densities at E19 in a thin layer of tissue corresponding to the inner half of the intermediate zone (IZ) and the upper ventricular zone (VZ). The neuroepithelium did not contain binding sites. High densities of sites were observed by E21 onward to P10 in the deep <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> layers corresponding to the intermediate zone(IZ) and layers V-VI. A decreasing gradient of receptor density was observed from layer VI to the marginal zone (layer I). The distribution of Neuropeptide Y(NPY) receptors does not match with the perikarya of transient Neuropeptide Y(NPY) -immunoreactive neurons located in the <BrainRegion>cortical plate</BrainRegion> but does coincide with their axonal extension. The receptor density decreased abruptly between P10 and P12 in deep layers, whereas a moderate expression of binding sites is detected from P10 to P12 in layers I-III. By P14, the binding level was the lowest observed in the postnatal period. From P21 onward, receptors were observed in superficial layers I-III, and their density rose by two- to threefold up to adulthood. Competition studies indicated that the Neuropeptide Y(NPY) receptors located in the deep <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> layers of the E21 or P1 rat <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion> exhibit Y2 receptor type characteristics. The binding sites detected in the superficial layers from P10 to P12 rats also show Y2 receptors characteristics, unlike the Neuropeptide Y(NPY) receptors in layers II-III of the adult, which behave like Y1 receptors. These data show that different Neuropeptide Y(NPY) receptor types are successively expressed in specific layers during late gestation and early postnatal life in the rat <BrainRegion>frontoparietal cortex</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Ocular dominance columns and retinal projections in New World spider monkeys (Ateles ater).</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText><BrainRegion>Retinal</BrainRegion> projections and the degree of ocular segregation in the <BrainRegion>striate cortex</BrainRegion> were examined by transneuronal autoradiography following unilateral intraocular injections of 3H-proline in a New World primate, the spider monkey (Ateles ater). The results show that, within the <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion> (LGN), <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> fibers terminate in six principal layers and within the interlaminar spaces adjacent to the magnocellular layers, as well as the S layers ventral to the magnocellular layers. Projections to the <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion>, both ipsilateral and contralateral to the injected eye, were patchy and restricted to the superficial gray layer. Our main result shows that, in the <BrainRegion>striate cortex</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(LGN) projections terminate in well-defined ocular dominance columns in layer IV. Labelled columns were most clearly delimited in layer IVb, where they averaged 373 + 42 micron in width in both the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres, slightly smaller than those reported originally from electrophysiological studies of <BrainRegion>striate cortex</BrainRegion> in spider monkeys (Hubel and Wiesel, &apos;68). Unlabelled intercolumns were significantly narrower than labelled columns, which suggests that there may be overlap between input from the two eyes between columns. Quantitative measures showed above-background label also in <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> layers IIIb, V, and VI. Our results support the idea that among primates, ocular dominance columns are not limited to Old World species. At the same time, it is apparent that spider monkeys are exceptional among New World primates in having sharply delimited columns. The functional significance of the variation in the degree of ocular segregation in the <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion> and its relation to primate evolution are discussed.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Terminations of individual optic tract fibers in the <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nuclei</BrainRegion> of Galago crassicaudatus and Tupaia belangeri.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The morphology and laminar distribution of individual optic fibers projecting to the <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion> (GL) of Galago and Tupaia were studied following iontophoretic injections of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) into the optic tract. In Galago the <BrainRegion>geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(GL) is composed of three functionally matched pairs of layers, each characterized by cells of a given size, one large, one medium-sized, and one small. The results show that there is a close correspondence between the size of the afferent fibers and the size of the neurons in the target layer: large axons project to the magnocellular layers, medium-sized axons project to the parvicellular layers, and small fibers project to the intercalated layers. In Tupaia the <BrainRegion>geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(GL) is composed of two functionally matched pairs and two unmatched layers. Optic fibers that project to the medial matched pair (1 and 2) are only slightly larger than those that project to the lateral matched pair (4 and 5), but both are larger than those that project to the unmatched layers (3 and 6). In both species terminal arbors and the distribution of terminal boutons within layers corresponded closely with the organization of dendritic processes of cells in the target layer. This correspondence was particularly evident in the parvicellular layers in Galago and in layer 6 in Tupaia: parvicellular terminal arbors, like the dendrites of parvicellular cells, are organized in narrow columns oriented along lines of projection, whereas layer 6 terminal arbors, like the dendrites of layer 6 cells, are oriented in elongated strips perpendicular to lines of projection. In both species there was evidence for sublaminar terminations in some layers. These were restricted to the parvicellular layers in Galago and layers 4 and 5 in Tupaia. With the exception of a small number of fine fibers in the intercalated layers in Galago, <BrainRegion>optic</BrainRegion> fibers in both species terminated in one and only one layer in a set. The significance of this result depends on the relation between ganglion cell classes and what is being segregated in different <BrainRegion>geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(GL) layers. <BrainRegion>Lateral geniculate</BrainRegion> lamination varies even in closely related species and has evolved independently in such distantly related lines as carnivores and primates. It is not surprising, therefore, that what is being segregated varies from species to species.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>The afferent connections of the <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion> of the golden hamster with emphasis on the retinohypothalamic projection.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The afferent connections of the <BrainRegion>hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion> (SCN) of the golden hamster were examined using horseradish peroxidase (HRP) as the retrograde tracer molecule. Unilateral iontophoretic deposition of horseradish peroxidase(HRP) into the <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion>(SCN) labeled ganglion cells bilaterally in the <BrainRegion>retinae</BrainRegion>. The labeled ganglion cells all had large somata and were randomly distributed across the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>. A similar number were labeled in each <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>, which contrasted with the findings from injections into the <BrainRegion>optic chiasm</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate body</BrainRegion>. <BrainRegion>Chiasm</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>geniculate</BrainRegion> injections both labeled three classes of ganglion cell (small, large, and giant) predominantly in the <BrainRegion>contralateral retinae</BrainRegion>. <BrainRegion>Telencephalic</BrainRegion> afferent projections to the <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion>(SCN) included the <BrainRegion>ventral subicular cortex</BrainRegion> and the septum. Notable <BrainRegion>diencephalic</BrainRegion> afferents included the dorsal lamina of the internal division of the <BrainRegion>ventral lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion> (vLGN); the ipsilateral input was twice that of the contralateral projection. The same region of the <BrainRegion>ventral lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(vLGN) was also noted to be reciprocally connected to the <BrainRegion>contralateral ventral lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(vLGN) . The <BrainRegion>thalamic paraventricular nucleus</BrainRegion> was also heavily labeled but only ipsilaterally. Of functional significance, the <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion>(SCN) was discovered to innervate its contralateral homologue. Other less numerous afferents in the <BrainRegion>midbrain</BrainRegion> included the <BrainRegion>dorsal and median raphe nuclei</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>dorsal nucleus of the lateral lemniscus</BrainRegion>. The afferent projections to the <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion>(SCN) determined in this study are discussed in regard to the known physiological role of the <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion>(SCN) as part of the circadian clock system.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Decrease and long-term recovery of choline acetyltransferase immunoreactivity in adult cat <BrainRegion>somatosensory cortex</BrainRegion> after peripheral nerve transections.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The functional reorganization of <BrainRegion>cerebral cortex</BrainRegion> following peripheral deafferentation is associated with changes in a number of neurotransmitters and related molecules. Acetylcholine (ACh) enhances neuronal responsiveness and could play a role in activity-dependent <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> plasticity. In this study, choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) immunohistochemistry was used to investigate Acetylcholine(ACh) innervation of the <BrainRegion>primary somatosensory cortex</BrainRegion> in cats sustaining complete unilateral forearm and paw denervations. Survival times of 2-52 weeks were examined. The deafferented contralateral <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion> was defined electrophysiologically, and quantitative estimates of choline acetyltransferase(ChAT) -immunoreactive fiber density were obtained from the forelimb and hindlimb sectors of <BrainRegion>area 3b</BrainRegion> in both hemispheres. In the <BrainRegion>3b</BrainRegion> forelimb sector contralateral to the deafferentation, a decrease in density of choline acetyltransferase(ChAT) -positive fibers relative to the ipsilateral hemisphere was apparent at 2 weeks and most pronounced at 13 weeks, involving all <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> layers except layer I. There was no such decrease in the hindlimb sector, but the loss of choline acetyltransferase(ChAT) immunoreactivity extended to sectors representing proximal forelimb and trunk. Changes in choline acetyltransferase(ChAT) immunoreactivity were no longer found after 1 year of survival. This long-lasting but reversible lowering of choline acetyltransferase(ChAT) immunoreactivity could result from a loss of afferent activity in basalis neurons and/or trophic influences retrogradely exerted by <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion> on these cells. Reduced Acetylcholine(ACh) transmission might then contribute to the loss of gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) inhibition in the deafferented <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion> by decreasing the activation of inhibitory interneurons. The long-term recovery of a normal choline acetyltransferase(ChAT) immunoreactivity in <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion> could be a consequence of its functional reorganization.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Changing pattern of expression of parvalbumin immunoreactivity during human fetal <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> development.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Expression of the calcium binding protein parvalbumin (PV) by different classes of <BrainRegion>spinal</BrainRegion> neuron has been shown to be developmentally regulated in both rat and monkey. From postmortem studies of eight human <BrainRegion>cervical spinal cords</BrainRegion> ranging in age from 11 to 35 weeks postconceptional age, we report that parvalbumin immunoreactivity is similarly plastic in human lower <BrainRegion>cervical spinal cord</BrainRegion> development, with many changes occurring prenatally. At 11-14 weeks postconceptional age, there was prominent immunostaining of primary sensory afferents that could be seen coursing through the <BrainRegion>dorsal horn</BrainRegion> and extensively innervating the motoneuron pools. Motoneurons were also found to be clearly immunoreactive for choline acetyltransferase by this age. A few <BrainRegion>ventral horn</BrainRegion> neurons that were not motoneurons were also parvalbumin immunoreactive. By 24-27 weeks postconceptional age, sensory afferents were still immunoreactive, as were many other axons throughout the white matter. In addition, many ventral horn neurons were now immunoreactive as well as a few <BrainRegion>dorsal horn</BrainRegion> neurons. By 31-35 weeks postconceptional age, there was extensive immunostaining of neurons throughout the spinal cord, including a few moderately immunoreactive motoneurons. There were many immunopositive axons in all the white matter tracts except the corticospinal tracts; however, staining of sensory axons traversing the grey matter was less prominent by this age. In the rat, expression of parvalbumin(PV) by primary sensory neurons coincides with the onset of fetal limb movement. The onset of expression of parvalbumin(PV) in <BrainRegion>ventral horn</BrainRegion> neurons coincides with later developmental events after the arrival of corticospinal inputs, whereas widespread parvalbumin(PV) immunoreactivity in dorsal horn neurons marks the attainment of a mature pattern of parvalbumin(PV) expression. The extent to which expression of parvalbumin(PV) immunoreactivity can be taken to indicate landmarks in human development will be discussed.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Divergence of single axons in afferent projections to the cat&apos;s <BrainRegion>visual cortical areas 17, 18, and 19</BrainRegion>: a parametric study.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The proportions of neurons projecting via axon collaterals to two areas in the cat&apos;s <BrainRegion>occipital cortex</BrainRegion> (diverging neurons) were determined quantitatively in <BrainRegion>subcortical</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> afferents by making use of the retrograde axonal transport of two different tracers. The proportions of diverging neurons were determined for that part of the afferent sites in which neurons filled with tracers from both injected areas occurred (overlap zone). A number of experimental variables were tested for their role in possibly influencing the results of quantitative double-label experiments, among them the types and the combinations of retrograde tracers, the position of the injections, the survival time, and the histological procedure. The most important variable was the position of the <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> injection, which had to be restricted clearly to the <BrainRegion>cortical grey matter</BrainRegion> and to one <BrainRegion>cortical area</BrainRegion> in order to avoid false-positive double labeling. Other experimental variables affected the total number of retrogradely labeled neurons and/or the ratio between neurons labeled with the two different tracers rather than the proportions of double-labeled neurons. In particular DL proportions were largely independent of the number and density of labeled neurons. They only deviated significantly from mean values in those sections in which the number of labeled neurons amounted to less than 20% of the maximal number of labeled neurons found in one section throughout the overlap zone. Our results show that divergence is common in afferents to the cat <BrainRegion>visual cortex</BrainRegion>. The amount of divergence, however, varies considerably according to the origin of the afferent projection. The proportion of diverging neurons expressed as the percentage of the total number of neurons projecting to <BrainRegion>areas 17 and 18</BrainRegion> was 3% in the A-laminae of the dorsal part of the <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>, about 8% in the <BrainRegion>posteromedial lateral suprasylvian area</BrainRegion>, and about 15% in the C-laminae of the dorsal part of the <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>, in the <BrainRegion>medial interlaminar nucleus</BrainRegion>, in the lateral part of the <BrainRegion>lateral posterior nucleus</BrainRegion>, and in the <BrainRegion>claustrum</BrainRegion>. The proportions of diverging neurons in the afferent projections to <BrainRegion>areas 17 and 19</BrainRegion>, and to <BrainRegion>areas 18 and 19</BrainRegion> were about 10%. Diverging neurons were also found in the projections of the <BrainRegion>intralaminar thalamic nuclei</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>visual cortex</BrainRegion>.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Chick wing innervation. II. Morphology of motor and sensory axons and their growth cones during early development.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The development and distribution of neuronal projections to the developing chick wing was studied using anterograde transport of horseradish peroxidase (HRP). Small injections of horseradish peroxidase(HRP) were made into motor or sensory neuronal populations in order to visualize individual axons and their associated growth cones. Motor growth cones were observed in different regions of the embryo at different stages, in a proximal-to-distal pattern of distribution which paralleled the process of axon outgrowth and nerve formation. Different growth cone morphologies were associated with differing regions of the developing projection. In the <BrainRegion>spinal</BrainRegion> nerves, axons destined for the limb were unbranched and terminated in simply shaped growth cones. As axons approached the developing limb and entered the plexus region, their growth cones became more complex and larger primarily because of widening, and they sometimes branched, producing processes which could extend tens of microns from a tricorne branch point on the parent axon. Both motor and sensory fibers showed similar morphological changes in the plexus region. A distinctively shaped growth cone expanded on its leading edge was observed, sequentially apparent in the distal spinal nerves, in the plexus region, in the loosely organized axonal sheets projecting to the uncleaved dorsal or ventral muscle masses, and where muscle nerves diverged from nerve trunks and within muscle nerves. It is likely that some of these are transitional growth cones preparing to branch, because complex and branched growth cones were also observed in these regions. Branched axons oriented along the anteroposterior axis were similarly observed in the plexus region and distal to the plexus when axons first projected to the limb bud. At somewhat older stages when the basic peripheral nerve branching pattern had formed, motor growth cones were observed in common nerve trunks and in individual muscle nerves, but they were no longer found in the plexus region. Branched axons were likewise restricted to these peripheral locations. Taken together, these observations suggest that one of the ways in which axons navigate is by exploration in the form of growth cone widening, and in some cases terminal bifurcation which may produce axon branches. Selection of the most appropriately directed growth cone process and/or precocious axonal branches may be one of the ways in which axons respond to specific growth cues which guide axons into the limb bud. Alternatively, this precocious branching may be an early neurotrophic response to developing muscle and play no significant role in axon navigation.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>A confocal and electron microscopic study of contacts between 5-HT fibres and feline <BrainRegion>dorsal horn</BrainRegion> interneurons in pathways from muscle afferents.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Morphological substrates of actions of serotonin upon <BrainRegion>dorsal horn</BrainRegion> interneurons with input from group II muscle afferents were investigated by using two experimental approaches. Twelve interneurons were intracellularly labelled with rhodamine-dextran, and serotoninergic fibres were identified by immunofluorescence. Appositions between the serotoninergic axons and these interneurons were examined with a dual-channel confocal microscope. A further four interneurons were intracellularly labelled with horseradish peroxidase, and serotoninergic axons were identified by immunocytochemistry; these neurons were prepared for combined light and electron microscopy. Confocal microscopy revealed serotoninergic varicosities in apposition to both cell bodies and dendrites. Similar total numbers of appositions were found on the soma, and on dendrites within 100 microm from the soma, on the most completely labelled neurons. The number of appositions on 100-microm segments of dendrites decreased with increasing distances from the soma (from 14.6 within 100 microm, to 3.8 and 2.4 at 100-300 microm, and more than 300 microm distances, respectively). Electron microscopic analysis of two neurons revealed that few of the apparent contacts on cell bodies were synaptic, but, in contrast, many varicosities apposed to proximal dendrites formed synapses. The evidence suggests that serotonin may have more powerful synaptic effects upon the dendrites of this class of <BrainRegion>dorsal horn</BrainRegion> interneurons than on their cell bodies.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Organization of afferent and efferent projections of the <BrainRegion>nucleus basalis prosencephali</BrainRegion> in a passerine, Taeniopygia guttata.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The connections of <BrainRegion>nucleus basalis</BrainRegion> (NB) of the <BrainRegion>rostral forebrain</BrainRegion> of the zebra finch were investigated electrophysiologically and with anterograde and retrograde tracing methods to determine their functional organization, the sources of their <BrainRegion>pontine</BrainRegion> afferents, and the targets of their <BrainRegion>telencephalic</BrainRegion> efferents. The nucleus was found to be partitioned into three major components, a rostral lingual part that received a hypoglossal projection via a <BrainRegion>lateral subnucleus of the principal sensory trigeminal nucleus</BrainRegion> (PrV), a middle beak part that received a trigeminal projection via a <BrainRegion>medial subnucleus of PrV</BrainRegion>, and a caudal auditory part that received a short latency auditory projection via the <BrainRegion>intermediate nucleus of the lateral lemniscus</BrainRegion>. Beak <BrainRegion>nucleus basalis</BrainRegion>(NB) also received a projection from a <BrainRegion>paralateral lemniscal nucleus</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>dorsocaudal part of auditory nucleus basalis</BrainRegion>(NB) and the medially adjacent <BrainRegion>neostriatum</BrainRegion> also received a projection from a <BrainRegion>lateral subnucleus of the superior vestibular nucleus</BrainRegion> (VS). The efferent projections of each of the three major parts of <BrainRegion>nucleus basalis</BrainRegion>(NB) were mainly to the adjacent <BrainRegion>neostriatum frontale</BrainRegion> (NF), which then provided projections to the <BrainRegion>lobus parolfactorius</BrainRegion> (exclusive of <BrainRegion>area X</BrainRegion>), the <BrainRegion>lateral archistriatum intermedium</BrainRegion> (Ail), and the <BrainRegion>lateral neostriatum caudale</BrainRegion> (NCl). <BrainRegion>Ail</BrainRegion> received a projection from <BrainRegion>neostriatum caudale</BrainRegion>(NCl) and provided terminal fields to the <BrainRegion>contralateral neostriatum caudale</BrainRegion>(NCl) and the <BrainRegion>neostriatum frontale</BrainRegion>(NF) . The major projections of <BrainRegion>Ail</BrainRegion>, however, descended bilaterally through the <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion> via the occipitomesencephalic tracts, with dense terminations in the <BrainRegion>medial spiriform nucleus</BrainRegion> and with extensive bilateral terminations throughout the <BrainRegion>lateral reticular formation of the pons and medulla</BrainRegion>. For the most part, jaw, tongue, and tracheosyringeal motor nuclei did not receive terminations. The results suggest that <BrainRegion>nucleus basalis</BrainRegion>(NB) in zebra finch, like <BrainRegion>nucleus basalis</BrainRegion>(NB) in pigeon and duck, is likely to be a major component of trigeminal sensorimotor circuitry involved in feeding and in other oral-manipulative behaviors. Results also show that the auditory component of <BrainRegion>nucleus basalis</BrainRegion>(NB) is not directly linked to the vocal control system at <BrainRegion>telencephalic</BrainRegion> levels, but the possibility remains that the lingual, beak, and auditory parts of <BrainRegion>nucleus basalis</BrainRegion>(NB) play a role in vocalization by multisynaptic influences on <BrainRegion>cranial nerve motor nuclei</BrainRegion> innervating various parts of the vocal tract.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Immunohistochemical localization of mu-opioid receptors in the central nervous system of the rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Of the three major types of opioid receptors ( mu, delta, kappa) in the nervous system, mu-opioid receptor shows the highest affinity for morphine that exerts powerful effects on nociceptive, autonomic, and psychological functions. So far, at least two isoforms of mu-opioid receptors have been cloned from rat brain. The present study attempted to examine immunohistochemically the distribution of mu-opioid receptors in the rat central nervous system with two kinds of antibodies to recently cloned mu-opioid receptors (MOR1 and MOR1B). One antibody recognized a specific site for MOR1, and the other bound to a common site for MOR1 and MOR1B. Intense MOR1-like immunoreactivity (LI) was seen in the &apos;patch' areas and subcallosal streak in the <BrainRegion>striatum</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>medial habenular nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>medial terminal nucleus of the accessory optic tract</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>interpeduncular nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>median raphe nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>parabrachial nuclei</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>locus coeruleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>ambiguous nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion>, and laminae I and II of the <BrainRegion>medullary</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>spinal dorsal horns</BrainRegion>. Many other regions, including the <BrainRegion>cerebral cortex</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>amygdala</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion>, also contained many neuronal elements with MOR1- MOR1-like immunoreactivity(LI) . The distribution pattern of the immunoreactivity revealed with the antibody to the common site for MOR1 and MOR1B (MOR1/1B- MOR1-like immunoreactivity(LI) ) was almost the same as that of MOR1- MOR1-like immunoreactivity(LI) . Both MOR1- MOR1-like immunoreactivity(LI) and MOR1/1B- MOR1-like immunoreactivity(LI) were primarily located in neuronal cell bodies and dendrites. However, the immunoreactivities were observed in the accessory optic tract, fasciculus retroflexus, solitary tract, and primary afferent fibers in the superficial layers of the <BrainRegion>medullary</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>spinal dorsal horns</BrainRegion>. The presynaptic location of MOR1- MOR1-like immunoreactivity(LI) and MOR1/1B- MOR1-like immunoreactivity(LI) was confirmed by lesion experiments: Enucleation, placing a lesion in the <BrainRegion>medial habenular nucleus</BrainRegion>, removal of the nodose ganglion, or dorsal rhizotomy resulted in a clear reduction of the immunoreactivities, respectively, in the <BrainRegion>nuclei of the accessory optic tract</BrainRegion>, some <BrainRegion>subnuclei of the interpeduncular nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion>, or laminae I and II of the <BrainRegion>spinal dorsal horn</BrainRegion>. The results indicate that the mu-opioid receptors are widely distributed in the brain and <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>, mainly postsynaptically and occasionally presynaptically. Opioids, including morphine, may inhibit the excitation of neurons via the postsynaptic mu-opioid receptors, and also suppress the release of neurotransmitters and/or neuromodulators from axon terminals through the presynaptic mu-opioid receptors.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Aldosterone-sensitive neurons in the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion>: bidirectional connections with the <BrainRegion>central nucleus of the amygdala</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The HSD2 (11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2-expressing) neurons in the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion> (NTS) of the rat are aldosterone-sensitive and have been implicated in sodium appetite. The <BrainRegion>central nucleus of the amygdala</BrainRegion> (CeA) has been shown to modulate salt intake in response to aldosterone, so we investigated the connections between these two sites. A prior retrograde tracing study revealed only a minor projection from the 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2-expressing(HSD2) neurons directly to the <BrainRegion>central nucleus of the amygdala</BrainRegion>(CeA) , but these experiments suggested that a more substantial projection may be relayed through the <BrainRegion>parabrachial nucleus</BrainRegion>. Small injections of cholera toxin beta subunit (CTb) into the <BrainRegion>external lateral parabrachial subnucleus</BrainRegion> (PBel) produced both retrograde cell body labeling in the 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2-expressing(HSD2) neurons and anterograde axonal labeling in the <BrainRegion>lateral subdivision of the central nucleus of the amygdala</BrainRegion>(CeA) . Also, injections of either cholera toxin beta subunit(CTb) or Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin into the <BrainRegion>medial subdivision of the central nucleus of the amygdala</BrainRegion>(CeA) labeled a descending projection from the <BrainRegion>amygdala</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>medial nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion>(NTS) . Axons from the <BrainRegion>medial central nucleus of the amygdala</BrainRegion>(CeA) formed numerous varicosities and terminals enveloping the 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2-expressing(HSD2) neurons. Complementary cholera toxin beta subunit(CTb) injections, centered in the 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2-expressing(HSD2) subregion of the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion>(NTS) , retrogradely labeled neurons in the <BrainRegion>medial central nucleus of the amygdala</BrainRegion>(CeA) . These bidirectional projections could form a functional circuit between the 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2-expressing(HSD2) neurons and the <BrainRegion>central nucleus of the amygdala</BrainRegion>(CeA) . The 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2-expressing(HSD2) neurons may represent one of the functional inputs to the <BrainRegion>lateral central nucleus of the amygdala</BrainRegion>(CeA) , and their activity may be modulated by a return projection from the <BrainRegion>medial central nucleus of the amygdala</BrainRegion>(CeA) . This circuit could provide a neuroanatomical basis for the modulation of salt intake by the <BrainRegion>central nucleus of the amygdala</BrainRegion>(CeA) .</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Pattern in the laminar origin of corticocortical connections.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The laminar origin of <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> projections to the <BrainRegion>frontal cortex</BrainRegion> was studied in 17 adult rhesus monkeys with the use of the retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase (HRP). The frontal regions injected with horseradish peroxidase(HRP) extended from the <BrainRegion>posterior periarcuate region</BrainRegion> to the frontal pole. The architectonic boundaries of areas containing horseradish peroxidase(HRP) -labeled neurons were determined from matched sections stained for the visualization of cell bodies, myelin, or acetylcholinesterase. The results showed that the laminar origin of both nearby and distant corticocortical projections was correlated with the architectonic differentiation of the regions giving rise to the projecting afferent fibers. Frontally directed projections from <BrainRegion>limbic cortices</BrainRegion>, which show a rudimentary laminar organization, emanated mainly from deep layers. On the other hand, projections from increasingly more differentiated <BrainRegion>cortices</BrainRegion> arose progressively from the upper (or supragranular) layers. This pattern was observed for projections originating along the axis of architectonic differentiation of the <BrainRegion>visual, somatosensory, auditory, motor, and prefrontal cortical systems</BrainRegion>. Thus, as the <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> architecture within each system changes from <BrainRegion>limbic areas</BrainRegion> toward the <BrainRegion>primary cortices</BrainRegion>, the origin of frontally directed projections shifts from predominantly infragranular to predominantly supragranular layers.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Expression of the zebrafish Iroquois genes during early nervous system formation and patterning.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Iroquois genes are involved in many patterning processes during development. In particular, they act as prepattern genes to control proneural gene expression both in Drosophila and in vertebrates. In this paper, we have analyzed the expression during embryogenesis of the 11 zebrafish Iroquois genes, with special interest for nervous system formation and patterning. During the first 2 days of development, Iroquois genes are expressed in distinct domains in the neuroepithelium, as well as in groups of neuronal progenitors and neurons. They are also expressed at different stages of placodal development. These expression patterns are similar to the patterns of the murine irx genes and also show features specific to teleosts. For the zebrafish Iroquois gene family, we find both specific patterns and patterns conserved within a cluster, between paralogues, or in most genes of the family. Overall, these expression data suggest functions for the Iroquois family of transcription factors in neural and placodal patterning, neurogenesis, and neuronal specification.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>The ascending input to the midbrain <BrainRegion>periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion> of the primate.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>To obtain a comprehensive map of the <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>spinal cord areas</BrainRegion> that project to the <BrainRegion>mesencephalic central gray</BrainRegion> small injections of horseradish peroxidase were made into various regions of the <BrainRegion>periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion> in a series of monkeys. Despite the fact that different regions of the <BrainRegion>central gray</BrainRegion> were injected in separate animals, the majority of the <BrainRegion>brainstem areas</BrainRegion> containing retrogradely filled neurons remained the same. Labeled neurons were observed in the <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>lateral parabrachial</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>locus coeruleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>nucleus raphe magnus and pallidus</BrainRegion>, and a variety of <BrainRegion>brainstem reticular nuclei</BrainRegion>. In contrast to labeled <BrainRegion>brainstem areas</BrainRegion>, where labeled neurons were present predominantly ipsilateral to the injection site, the <BrainRegion>spinal trigeminal nucleus pars caudalis</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> displayed labeled cells chiefly on the side contralateral to the injection. Also in contrast to the labeled <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion> sites, where medial and lateral injection sites produced a similar pattern of labeling, medial injections in the <BrainRegion>PAG</BrainRegion> labeled almost exclusively neurons in the deep laminae (V-X) in the <BrainRegion>spinal trigeminal nucleus pars caudalis</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> while more lateral injections labeled neurons in both the deep (V-X) and superficial (I) laminae. No consistent differences were noted in the location of labeled neurons in either <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion> or <BrainRegion>spinal</BrainRegion> sites after dorsal vs. ventral injections or caudal vs. rostral injection sites. The present study has demonstrated that the <BrainRegion>central gray</BrainRegion> receives afferent projections from a number of <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>spinal areas</BrainRegion> which are known to be involved in the modulation and/or conduction of nociception, while other inputs are probably involved in the regulation of visceral functions. These data support the hypothesis that the <BrainRegion>mesencephalic periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion> functions as a visceral, nociceptive, and cognitive integrator.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Localization of metabotropic glutamate receptor 7 mRNA and mGluR7a protein in the rat <BrainRegion>basal ganglia</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) coupled to G-proteins have important roles in the regulation of <BrainRegion>basal ganglia</BrainRegion> function. We have examined the localization of the mGluR7 mRNA and mGluR7a protein in the <BrainRegion>basal ganglia</BrainRegion> of the rat. Strong mGluR7 hybridization signals are found in <BrainRegion>cerebral cortex</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>striatum</BrainRegion>, but much less intense signals are present in other components of the <BrainRegion>basal ganglia</BrainRegion>. Abundant mGluR7a immunoreactivity was found in <BrainRegion>striatum</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>globus pallidus</BrainRegion> (GP), and <BrainRegion>substantia nigra pars reticulata</BrainRegion> (SNr). Examination using confocal microscopy together with dendritic and presynaptic markers as well as studies in lesion models provided evidence for the presence of mGluR7a on presynaptic terminals in all three structures. Electron microscopic studies confirmed the presence of mGluR7a in axon terminals in both the <BrainRegion>striatum</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>globus pallidus</BrainRegion>(GP) and also revealed the presence of mGluR7a at postsynaptic sites in both of these regions. Our data demonstrate that mGluR7a is located not only on presynaptic glutamatergic terminals of the corticostriatal pathway, where it may serve as an autoreceptor, but also on terminals of striatopallidal and striatonigral projections, where it may modulate the release of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). The presence of mGluR7 at these multiple sites in the <BrainRegion>basal ganglia</BrainRegion> suggests that this receptor has a particularly crucial role in modulating neurotransmitter release in major <BrainRegion>basal ganglia</BrainRegion> pathways.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Morphology, central projections, and dendritic field orientation of <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> ganglion cells in the ferret.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText><BrainRegion>Retinal</BrainRegion> ganglion cells were studied in pigmented ferrets that received small electrophoretic injections of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) into the <BrainRegion>dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion> (LGNd) or optic tract. Ferret <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> contains a number of types of <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> ganglion cells of which the relative cell body sizes, dendritic field structures, and central projections correspond closely to those of <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> ganglion cell types in the cat. Ferret <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> contains about the same proportion of alphalike cells, a lower proportion of betalike cells, and thus a high proportion of other types of ganglion cells than cat <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>. Ferret <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> has a visual streak and somewhat weaker area centralis than cat <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>. Changes in ganglion cell morphology associated with eccentricity are less pronounced in the ferret than in the cat. The adult ferret <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> is about 12.5 mm in diameter, and the nasotemporal division is about 2.7 mm from the temporal margin. Interestingly, virtually all alpha cells in the pigmented ferrets studied projected contralaterally. Studies of infant ferrets indicate that 4 days after birth (P4) the area of ferret <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> is 25% that of the adult. The neonatal ferret <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> contains numerous small, densely packed cells in the presumptive ganglion cell layer. At P4 these cells appear to be uniformly distributed across the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>area centralis</BrainRegion> and visual streak are not obvious as late as 8 days after birth.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Expression of c-fos protein in interneurons and projection neurons of the rat <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> in response to noxious somatic, articular, and visceral stimulation.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>This study used immunocytochemistry to examine the pattern of noxious-stimulus evoked expression of the proto-oncogene c-fos in the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> of the rat. Both noxious somatic and joint stimulation in awake rats evoked the expression of c-fos protein in similar areas of the <BrainRegion>lumbar spinal cord</BrainRegion>. C-fos-immunoreactive neurons were found in laminae I and outer II, in the lateral part of the neck of the <BrainRegion>dorsal horn</BrainRegion>, and in laminae VII, VIII, and X. All of the labelled neurons were located ipsilateral to the injured hindpaw, except for lamina VIII where bilateral labelling was recorded. The c-fos-immunoreactive neurons in lamina I extended from the L3 segment to the rostral sacral cord; staining in outer lamina II was only found at the L4 segment. The more deeply located cells, of the <BrainRegion>dorsal and medioventral horns</BrainRegion>, had the most extensive rostrocaudal spread; they were found from L1 through the rostral sacral segments. The pattern of c-fos-immunoreactivity produced by visceral stimulation, in anesthetized rats, differed in several ways from that produced by somatic stimulation. First, there was considerable bilateral, symmetrical labelling of cells. Second, there was a much more extensive rostrocaudal spread of the labelling, from cervical through sacral cord. Third, the greatest rostrocaudal spread was found for neurons in the <BrainRegion>superficial dorsal horn</BrainRegion>; labelled cells in the neck of the <BrainRegion>dorsal horn</BrainRegion> and in lamina X were restricted to segments at the thoracolumbar junction, which is also where the <BrainRegion>superficial dorsal horn</BrainRegion> cells were most concentrated. Fourth, there were very few labelled neurons in the outer part of the <BrainRegion>substantia gelatinosa</BrainRegion>. To determine whether any neurons that express the c-fos protein in response to noxious stimulation project to supraspinal sites, we combined the immunocytochemical localization of c-fos with the localization of a retrogradely transported protein-gold complex that was injected into the <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion> targets of the major ascending spinal pathways. In rats that received the somatic noxious stimulus, 90% of all of the c-fos projection neurons were recorded in four major areas of the cord: lamina I (37%), the lateral part of the neck of the <BrainRegion>dorsal horn</BrainRegion> (24%), laminae VIII (9%), and X (29%). The remainder were scattered throughout the <BrainRegion>spinal gray</BrainRegion>. With the exception of lamina VIII, which contained c-fos projection neurons contralateral to the inflamed paw, all of the c-fos projection neurons were located ipsilateral to the injured paw.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Distribution of the major gamma-aminobutyric acid(A) receptor subunits in the <BrainRegion>basal ganglia</BrainRegion> and associated <BrainRegion>limbic brain areas</BrainRegion> of the adult rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Within the <BrainRegion>basal ganglia</BrainRegion>, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) exerts a fundamental role as neurotransmitter of local circuit and projection neurons. Its fast hyperpolarizing action is mediated through gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) (A) receptors. These ligand-gated chloride channels are assembled from five subunits, which derive from multiple genes. Using immunocytochemistry, we investigated the distribution of 12 major gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) (A) receptor subunits (alpha1-5, beta1-3, gamma1-3, and delta) in the <BrainRegion>basal ganglia</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>associated limbic brain areas</BrainRegion> of the rat. Immunoreactivity for an additional subunit (subunit alpha6) was not observed. The <BrainRegion>striatum</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>nucleus accumben</BrainRegion>s, and the <BrainRegion>olfactory tubercle</BrainRegion> displayed strong, diffuse staining for the subunits alpha2, alpha4, beta3, and delta presumably located on dendrites of the principal medium spiny neurons. Subunit alpha1-, beta2-, and gamma2-immunoreactivities were apparently mostly restricted to interneurons of these areas. In contrast, the <BrainRegion>globus pallidus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>entopeduncular nucleus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>ventral pallidum</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>subthalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>substantia nigra pars reticulata</BrainRegion> revealed dense networks of presumable dendrites of resident projection neurons, which were darkly labeled for subunit alpha1-, beta2-, and gamma2-immunoreactivities. The <BrainRegion>globus pallidus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>ventral pallidum</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>entopeduncular nucleus</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>substantia nigra pars reticulata</BrainRegion>, all areas receiving innervations from the <BrainRegion>striatum</BrainRegion>, displayed strong subunit gamma1-immunoreactivity compared to other brain areas. In the <BrainRegion>substantia nigra pars compacta</BrainRegion> and in the <BrainRegion>ventral tegmental area</BrainRegion>, numerous presumptive dopaminergic neurons were labeled for subunits alpha3, gamma3, and/or delta. This highly heterogeneous distribution of individual gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) (A) receptor subunits suggests the existence of differently assembled, and presumably also functionally different, gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) (A) receptors within individual nuclei of the <BrainRegion>basal ganglia</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>associated limbic brain areas</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Brainstem</BrainRegion> projections to the normal and noradrenergically hyperinnervated <BrainRegion>trigeminal motor nucleus</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The noradrenergic innervation of the <BrainRegion>trigeminal motor nucleus</BrainRegion> of the rat can be increased severalfold by neonatal treatment with the neurotoxin, 6-hydroxydopamine. The <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion> projections to the nucleus were studied by injecting HRP into the nucleus of normal and noradrenergically hyperinnervated rats. In order to identify the source of the noradrenergic innervation, the fluorescent dye, True Blue, was used as a retrograde tracer in combination with the glyoxylic acid histofluorescence method for catecholamines. In both control and neonatally treated rats, the noradrenergic innervation of the <BrainRegion>motor nucleus</BrainRegion> was shown to arise from an ipsilateral group of cells located among the fibers of the <BrainRegion>lateral lemniscus</BrainRegion> just rostral to the <BrainRegion>motor nucleus</BrainRegion>. Our results confirmed the high degree of specificity of noradrenergic innervation, which arises exclusively from this <BrainRegion>lateral tegmental</BrainRegion> noradrenergic cell group. During the process of sprouting, this specificity is maintained since only those noradrenergic cells normally innervating the nucleus were retrogradely labeled in neonatally treated animals. Other noradrenergic projections which are also increased in these animals, such as the nearby <BrainRegion>locus ceruleus</BrainRegion> innervation of the <BrainRegion>main sensory trigeminal nucleus</BrainRegion>, do not spread to the <BrainRegion>motor trigeminal nucleus</BrainRegion>. HRP-labeled nonadrenergic cells were concentrated dorsally, with scattered cells surrounding the nucleus. A similar distribution was observed contralateral to the injection site. The <BrainRegion>mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus</BrainRegion> was labeled only ipsilateral to the injection. The motor nucleus also receives an extensive bilateral input from the <BrainRegion>pontine</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>medullary reticular formation</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>medial reticular formation nuclei</BrainRegion>, including <BrainRegion>nucleus pontis caudalis</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>nucleus gigantocellularis</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>nucleus reticularis ventralis</BrainRegion> contained large labeled cells, which were especially numerous in the <BrainRegion>retrotrigeminal area</BrainRegion>. Smaller, <BrainRegion>lateral reticular formation</BrainRegion> neurons were concentrated rostrally and ipsilaterally in the <BrainRegion>nucleus pontis lateralis</BrainRegion>. HRP retrograde labeling revealed no obvious change in the overall pattern of cells innervating the <BrainRegion>trigeminal motor nucleus</BrainRegion> following noradrenergic hyperinnervation.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Neuron-specific age-related decreases in dopamine receptor subtype mRNAs.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Age-related decline in dopamine receptor levels has been observed in regional studies of animal and human brains; however, identifying specific cellular substrates and/or alterations in distinct neuronal populations remains elusive. To evaluate whether age-related decreases in dopamine receptor subtypes are associated with specific cell populations in the <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>entorhinal cortex</BrainRegion>, antisense RNA amplification was combined with cDNA array analysis to examine effects of aging on D1-D5 dopamine receptor mRNA expression levels in <BrainRegion>hippocampal</BrainRegion> <BrainRegion>CA1</BrainRegion> pyramidal neurons and <BrainRegion>entorhinal cortex</BrainRegion> layer II stellate cells from post-mortem human brains (19-92 years). In <BrainRegion>CA1</BrainRegion> pyramidal neurons, significant age-related decline was observed for dopamine receptor mRNAs (D1-D4, P &amp;lt; 0.001; D5, P &lt; 0.05) but not for the cytoskeletal elements beta-actin, three-repeat (3R) tau, and four-repeat (4R) tau. In contrast, no significant changes were observed in stellate cells across the same cohort. Thus, senescence may be a factor responsible for cell-specific decrements in dopamine receptor gene expression in one population of neurons within a circuit that is critical for learning and memory. Furthermore, these results support the hypothesis that alterations in dopaminergic function may also be related to behavioral abnormalities, such as psychosis, that occur with aging.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<AbstractText>The <BrainRegion>mesencephalic</BrainRegion> projections of the <BrainRegion>medial cerebellar nucleus</BrainRegion> (MCN) were studied in the rat by using the method of anterograde transport of wheat germ agglutinin/horseradish peroxidase to establish connections of the nucleus with <BrainRegion>oculomotor-related nuclei</BrainRegion> as a basis for its proposed role in eye movement. The principal targets of projections were the <BrainRegion>supraoculomotor ventral periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion> (PAG) and <BrainRegion>lateral periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion>(PAG) , and <BrainRegion>paraoculomotor cell groups</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>nucleus of Darkschewitsch</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>medial accessory nucleus of Bechterew</BrainRegion>). Lesser projections were observed to the intermediate layer of the <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>nucleus of the posterior commissure</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>prerubral field</BrainRegion>. Following transcannular HRP gel implants into the <BrainRegion>oculomotor complex</BrainRegion> that included adjacent <BrainRegion>paraoculomotor nuclei</BrainRegion>, the largest number of retrogradely labeled cells was found in the <BrainRegion>caudal medial cerebellar nucleus</BrainRegion>(MCN) . The findings suggest that the <BrainRegion>caudal medial cerebellar nucleus</BrainRegion>(MCN) in the rat, like the primate <BrainRegion>fastigial nucleus</BrainRegion>, is involved in the control of eye movement.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Regenerating vagal afferents reinnervate gastrointestinal tract smooth muscle of the rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Peripheral projections of the vagus are known to regenerate after subdiaphragmatic vagotomy, but neither the question of whether the regenerating axons are motor or sensory nor the issue of whether the fibers reinnervate their original targets have been addressed. To determine whether vagal afferents regenerate and whether they differentiate into normal terminal specializations in the reinnervated target organ, male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent complete subdiaphragmatic vagotomies and were injected 18 weeks later with 3 microl of 4% wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) in the left nodose ganglion. To provide a comparison group, an unoperated group (controls) was injected with wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase(WGA-HRP) in the left nodose ganglion. The esophagus, the entire stomach, the first 8 cm of the duodenum, and the hilus of the liver were prepared as wholemounts and processed with tetramethyl benzidine. Vagal afferents were found to have regenerated and reinnervated the esophagus, stomach, duodenum, and liver. Bundles (two or more axons), individual vagal axons, and terminals in the stomach were counted and mapped with a sampling grid. At 18 weeks postvagotomy, the reinnervated stomach and duodenum contained normal terminals as well as aberrant endings and growth cone profiles. The ingrowing axons reestablished ipsilateral and contralateral projections in the same proportions seen in controls, although the overall density of the different regenerating elements had reached only 7-39% of control values. These findings demonstrate that the gastrointestinal tract and liver can undergo dramatic afferent reinnervation after vagotomy. The presence of differentiated endings at 18 weeks suggests that some afferent function(s) may be restored, and the expression of growth cones suggests that additional regeneration may be ongoing.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<AbstractText>The present study was conducted to examine the plasticity of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)-immunoreactive terminals in the rat <BrainRegion>phrenic nucleus</BrainRegion> following an ipsilateral C2 <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> hemisection and 30-day survival period. A retrograde horseradish peroxidase (HRP) labeling technique was used to identify the phrenic motoneurons at the electron microscopic (EM) level. After employing a pre-embedding immunocytochemical technique, the ultrastructural characteristics of 5-hydroxytryptamine(5-HT) -immunoreactive terminals were qualitatively and then quantitatively analyzed with a computerized morphometric system before and after injury in separate groups of rats. The results indicated that the majority of the 5-hydroxytryptamine(5-HT) -labeled terminals formed axodendritic contacts, but some 5-hydroxytryptamine(5-HT) -labeled terminals made axosomatic contacts. 5-hydroxytryptamine(5-HT) terminals were associated with either asymmetrical or symmetrical synapses, and some displayed postsynaptic dense bodies. Approximately 2% of the 5-hydroxytryptamine(5-HT) terminals had dense-core vesicles. Although the total number of labeled and unlabeled terminals in the <BrainRegion>phrenic nucleus</BrainRegion> was reduced after hemisection, the number of 5-hydroxytryptamine(5-HT) terminals in the hemisected group was greater than that of the control group. Moreover, the total number and length of asymmetrical and symmetrical synaptic active zones per 5-hydroxytryptamine(5-HT) terminal were significantly greater after injury. Finally, the total number of 5-hydroxytryptamine(5-HT) terminals with multiple synapses was significantly greater in the hemisected group as compared to controls. It is possible that 5-hydroxytryptamine(5-HT) synaptic plasticity may be part of the morphological substrate for the unmasking of the latent crossed phrenic pathway which mediates recovery of the ipsilateral hemidiaphragm paralyzed by C2 <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> hemisection.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Anatomical evidence for cone and rod-like receptors in the gray squirrel, ground squirrel, and prairie dog retinas.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>In the gray squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis), the prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus), and the Mexican and 13-line ground squirrels (Citellus mexicanus and C. tridecemlineatus) there exist two distinct classes of photo-receptors that have cone-like and rod-like anatomical features respectively. These two receptor classes were previously known to exist in the gray squirrel, but only the cone-like (C) receptor had been observed in the other species. We have now found small numbers of rod-like (R) receptors in the other species as well. R-receptors comprise about 40% of the receptors in the gray squirrel, 10% of the receptors in the prairie dog, and 4-5% of the receptors in the two species of ground squirrel. This paper describes certain light and electron microscopic features of these two receptor classes including their synaptic connections with second-order cells and with each other. We find that the C-receptor has a morphology and synaptic organization characteristic of other mammalian cones. However, the R-receptor differs from other mammalian rods in certain morphological respects, and its synaptic organization has both cone and rod characteristics as well as some unusual features.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Immunohistochemical localization of enkephalin in rat brain and <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The distribution of immunoreactive enkephalin in rat brain and <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> was studied by immunoperoxidase staining using antiserum to leucine-enkephalin ([Leu5]-enkephalin) or methionine-enkephalin ([Met5]-enkephalin). Immunoreactive staining for both enkephalins was similarly observed in nerve fibers, terminals and cell bodies in many regions of the central nervous system. Staining of perikarya was detected in hypophysectomized rats or colchicine pretreated rats. The regions of localization for enkephalin fibers and terminals include in the <BrainRegion>forebrain</BrainRegion>: <BrainRegion>lateral septum</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>central nucleus of the amygdala</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>area CA2 of the hippocampus</BrainRegion>, certain regions of the <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>corpus striatum</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>bed nucleus of the stria terminalis</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion> including <BrainRegion>median eminence</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>subthalamus</BrainRegion>; in the <BrainRegion>midbrain</BrainRegion>: <BrainRegion>nucleus interpeduncularis</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>reticular formation</BrainRegion>; in the <BrainRegion>hind brain</BrainRegion>: <BrainRegion>nucleus parabrachialis</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>locus ceruleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>nuclei raphes</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>nucleus cochlearis</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>nucleus tractus solitarii</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>nucleus spinalis nervi trigemini</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>motor nuclei of certain cranial nerves</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>nucleus commissuralis</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>formatio reticularis</BrainRegion>; and in the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> the <BrainRegion>substantia gelatinosa</BrainRegion>. In contrast enkephalin cell bodies appear sparsely distributed in the <BrainRegion>telencephalon</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>diencephalon</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>mesencephalon</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>rhombencephalon</BrainRegion>. The results of the histochemical staining show that certain structures which positively stain for enkephalin closely correspond to the distribution of opiate receptors in the brain and thus support the concept that the endogenous opiate peptides are involved in the perception of pain and analgesia. The localization of enkephalin in the <BrainRegion>preoptic-hypothalamic region</BrainRegion> together with the presence of enkephalin perikarya in the <BrainRegion>paraventricular</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>supraoptic nuclei</BrainRegion> suggest a role of enkephalin in the regulation of neuroendocrine functions.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Odorant molecular length: one aspect of the olfactory code.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Organic acid odorants of differing carbon number produce systematically different spatial patterns of [(14)C]2-deoxyglucose uptake in the glomerular layer of the <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>. Because increasing carbon number correlates with progressive increases in several molecular features, including hydrophobicity, length, and volume, we determined which of these properties was most associated with systematic changes in the location of an anterior, dorsomedial module responding to fatty acids. We exposed groups of rats to two series of organic acids that each had the same number of carbons, but differed in their hydrocarbon structures. These straight-chained, branched, cyclic, and double-bonded molecules differed independently in hydrophobicity, length, and volume. The only molecular property that was strongly correlated with the location of the module was molecular length, suggesting that this molecular feature is the principal determinant of the chemotopic organization of glomeruli within the module. We also found that distinct hydrocarbon structures produced large differences in spatial patterns of 2-deoxyglucose uptake in posterior parts of the bulb. Even subtly distinct structural isomers evoked posterior responses that differed greatly. The odorant 2-methylbutyric acid evoked much greater uptake in the posterior bulb than did its structural isomer 3-methylbutyric acid (isovaleric acid). These data suggest that posterior portions of the bulb may encode specific steric features of odorant molecules and that some odorant features may have an inherent or acquired greater representation than do others.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Alpha and gamma motoneurons in the <BrainRegion>peroneal nuclei</BrainRegion> of the cat <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>: an ultrastructural study.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The aim of the present study was to investigate whether ultrastructural features can be used as a guide to identify alpha- and gamma-motoneurons among the intermediate-size neurons of the <BrainRegion>peroneal motor nuclei</BrainRegion>. The peroneus brevis and peroneus tertius muscles of adult cats were injected with horseradish peroxidase, and motoneurons labeled by retrograde axonal transport were examined by electron microscopy. In both nuclei, the distributions of cell-body diameters, measured in the light microscope, were bimodal covering the range of 28-84 microns, with a trough around 50 microns. The sample of 25 motoneurons selected for the ultrastructural study included not only large (presumed alpha) and small (presumed gamma) neurons but also intermediate-size cell bodies with diameters in the 40-60 microns range. For each motoneuron, 2-5 profiles were reconstructed from ultrathin sections taken at 6-8 microns intervals. Synaptic boutons were counted and their lengths of apposition were measured. On the basis of three criteria, namely: (1) bouton types present on the membrane, (2) percentage of membrane length covered by synapses, and (3) the aspect of the nucleolus, all the examined motoneurons, including those with intermediate sizes, fell into one of two categories. Fourteen motoneurons, with cell-body diameters in a range of 55-84 microns, were contacted by all types of boutons (mainly S-type with spherical vesicles, F-type with flattened vesicles, and C-type with subsynaptic cistern); the synaptic covering of the somatic membrane was over 40% and the nucleus contained a vacuolated nucleolus. These were considered alpha-motoneurons. Eleven motoneurons, with only S and F boutons, a synaptic covering under 30%, a compact nucleolus and a cell-body diameter ranging between 28 and 50 microns, were considered gamma-motoneurons. No other combination of the three criteria was observed. These results show that unequivocal distinction of alpha- and gamma-motoneurons is possible in the <BrainRegion>peroneal nuclei</BrainRegion>, on the basis of morphological differences independent of cell-body size.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>NADPH-diaphorase reactive neurons of the rabbit <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>: differential sensitivity to excitotoxins and unusual morphologic features.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Various populations of <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> and brain neurons display different degrees of sensitivity to the toxic effects of excitatory amino acid agonists. To further define this phenomenon, the effects of intravitreal injections of kainic acid, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), quinolinic acid, and ibotenic acid on NADPH-diaphorase (NADPHd) reactive cells of the rabbit retina were examined. In normal rabbit <BrainRegion>retinas</BrainRegion>, NADPH-diaphorase(NADPHd) histochemistry selectively stains two populations of cells at the inner margin of the inner plexiform layer: large densely staining (Type I) and more numerous, smaller and lightly staining (Type II) cells. All of the toxins studied destroy both cell types at high doses. Kainic acid, however, at low doses destroys Type I cells but selectively spares Type II cells. N-methyl-D-aspartate(NMDA) injections result in a more complex and less consistent pattern of cell loss; overall, the Type I cells are perhaps slightly resistant to this agent as compared to Type II cells. The Type I neurons in this respect are analogous to <BrainRegion>striatal</BrainRegion> NADPH-diaphorase(NADPHd) -reactive neurons, which have, at most, a slight relative resistance to N-methyl-D-aspartate(NMDA) neurotoxicity. The excitotoxin lesions reduce the complexity of the fiber plexus in the inner plexiform layer and thereby reveal anatomic features of surviving NADPH-diaphorase(NADPHd) reactive neurons that are not apparent in normal <BrainRegion>retinas</BrainRegion>. In particular, each Type I cell gives off several fine, straight, beaded processes that emanate from dendrites and run several millimeters in the inner plexiform layer. These processes are presumably involved in long-distance interactions within the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>. Excitotoxin lesions may provide a generally useful anatomic tool for elucidating morphological features of neurons stained by histochemical and immunohistochemical methods.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Ipsilateral cortical connections of <BrainRegion>primary somatic sensory cortex</BrainRegion> in rats.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The organization of ipsilateral <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> connections of the rat <BrainRegion>primary somatic sensory area</BrainRegion> (SI) was analyzed following small injections of multiple fluorescent tracers in the same case, into two or three <BrainRegion>somatic sensory area</BrainRegion>(SI) body representations identified electrophysiologically. Labeling patterns were studied in tangential <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> sections and in flattened reconstructions from coronal sections. The cytochrome oxidase staining in tangential sections served as a control for injection location and to position labeling patterns found within granular portion of <BrainRegion>somatic sensory area</BrainRegion>(SI) . The results show that most connections made with <BrainRegion>somatic sensory area</BrainRegion>(SI) are reciprocal. Their topographical organization show different degrees of precision in the different areas. Homotypical and heterotypical connections were defined, the latter being more evident within the granular portion of <BrainRegion>somatic sensory area</BrainRegion>(SI) . The findings: (1) were consistent with subdividing rat <BrainRegion>somatic sensory area</BrainRegion>(SI) into four distinct areas with each having its own pattern of connections, (2) revealed two topographically organized regions in <BrainRegion>parietal cortex</BrainRegion> lateral to <BrainRegion>somatic sensory area</BrainRegion>(SI) called <BrainRegion>second somatosensory</BrainRegion> ( <BrainRegion>somatic sensory area</BrainRegion>(SI) I) and <BrainRegion>parietal ventral (PV) areas</BrainRegion>, (3) confirmed a topographical pattern in <BrainRegion>motor cortex</BrainRegion> and suggested an organization for connections between <BrainRegion>somatic sensory area</BrainRegion>(SI) and an <BrainRegion>agranular medial field</BrainRegion>, and (4) demonstrated three more regions in <BrainRegion>parietal cortex</BrainRegion> connected to <BrainRegion>somatic sensory area</BrainRegion>(SI) : <BrainRegion>posterior to somatic sensory area</BrainRegion>(SI) called <BrainRegion>parietal medial</BrainRegion>; <BrainRegion>lateral to parietal ventral</BrainRegion>(PV) called <BrainRegion>parietal rhinal</BrainRegion>; <BrainRegion>posterior to somatic sensory area</BrainRegion>(SI) I called <BrainRegion>parietal lateral</BrainRegion>. Differences were noted in the distinctions between and within the maps when label distributions were plotted separately from supra- and infragranular layers. These findings agree with previous parcellations of the rat <BrainRegion>somatic sensory area</BrainRegion>(SI) (Chapin et al., &apos;87: J. Comp Neurol 263:326-346), squirrel <BrainRegion>parietal ventral</BrainRegion>(PV) and <BrainRegion>somatic sensory area</BrainRegion>(SI) I (Krubitzer et al., &apos;86: J.

<ArticleTitle>Immunohistochemical localization of calbindin-D28K and calretinin in the lamprey <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Calbindin-D28K and calretinin are homologous cytosolic calcium binding proteins localized in many <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> neurons from different species. In this report, location of cells immunoreactive to both proteins was investigated in the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> of the lamprey, Lampetra fluviatilis. This organism constitutes one of the older representative vertebrates and possesses a peculiar organization, probably unique: two-thirds of the ganglion cells are in the classical amacrine cell layer and the nerve fiber layer is located in the scleral part of the inner plexiform layer. Calbindin-like immunoreactivity was demonstrated in large bipolar cells and in cell bodies located in the <BrainRegion>inner retina</BrainRegion>. Although the distinction between labelled ganglion cells and labelled amacrine cells was rendered difficult, we hypothesized that the majority of calbindin-immunoreactive cells observed in the <BrainRegion>inner retina</BrainRegion> are ganglion cells, because of the high number of labelled fibers in the nerve fiber layer. Calretinin-like immunoreactivity was detected in both large and small bipolar cells, and also in cells located in the <BrainRegion>inner retina</BrainRegion>. Since few calretinin-immunoreactive fibers were observed in the nerve fiber layer, we assume that the latter category of cells are amacrine cells. Horizontal cells were both negative for calbindin and calretin-like immunoreactivities. Calbindin and calretinin, which are present in cones from many species, could not be detected in the photoreceptor layer favouring the rod-dominated lamprey <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>. Although their distribution differs from those observed in most vertebrates, the present results indicate the good conservation of both calcium binding proteins in the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> during the vertebrate evolution.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Morphology and mosaics of VIP-like immunoreactive neurons in the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> of the rhesus monkey.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is a 28-amino acid peptide that has been demonstrated to reside in cells ( = Vasoactive intestinal peptide(VIP) + cells) of the <BrainRegion>retinae</BrainRegion> of various vertebrate species. In an attempt to study the morphology and distribution of Vasoactive intestinal peptide(VIP) + cells in the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> of the rhesus monkey in more detail, we subjected Vasoactive intestinal peptide(VIP) + cells observed in cryostat sections or wholemounts rhesus monkey <BrainRegion>retinae</BrainRegion> to a quantitative analysis. Vasoactive intestinal peptide(VIP) + cells were found to reside in the innermost row of the inner nuclear layer (INL) and in the ganglion cell layer (GCL) in similar numbers (estimate: 50 cells/mm2 at 6-10 mm eccentricity each) and only on rare occasions (12% of all Vasoactive intestinal peptide(VIP) + cells) in varying positions within the inner plexiform layer (IPL). Somata of Vasoactive intestinal peptide(VIP) + cells were circular and had a mean diameter of 9.1 microns. They gave rise to 1-3 main dendrites, which were usually oriented toward the inner plexiform layer(IPL) . Main dendrites ramified widely into thin fibers (dendritic field diameter less than = 1 mm), carrying varicose swellings. The fibers that contributed to one and the same plexus of Vasoactive intestinal peptide(VIP) + fibers preferred the middle third of the inner plexiform layer(IPL) , independent of the positions of the parent somata. A quantitative analysis of nearest-neighbour distances in the <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> wholemount preparation suggested that Vasoactive intestinal peptide(VIP) + cells in the ganglion cell layer(GCL) and in the inner nuclear layer(INL) might be distributed according to 2 independent mosaics. A comparison with Golgi-stained material leads to the tentative equation of Vasoactive intestinal peptide(VIP) + cells with the &quot;spiny" A12 amacrine cell of Mariani ('90). Whereas the low density and large dendritic field size of Vasoactive intestinal peptide(VIP) + cells might suggest a more widespread function, the varicose dendritic morphology seems to be more compatible with functionally independent dendritic subunits mediating localized effects.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Connection from <BrainRegion>cortical area V2</BrainRegion> to <BrainRegion>V3 A</BrainRegion> in macaque monkey.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The <BrainRegion>V2</BrainRegion> projection to <BrainRegion>V3 A</BrainRegion> was labeled by pressure microinjecting biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) and Phaseolus vulgaris lectin (PHA-L) into <BrainRegion>V2</BrainRegion> just posterior to the <BrainRegion>lunate sulcus</BrainRegion>. Dense terminal labeling in clusters was found in layer 4, with a weaker terminal projection in layer 3. About 3.5--4.1% of the synapses in the densest bouton clusters in layer 4 were made by labeled boutons. All were asymmetric (Gray&apos;s type 1) synapses, made by spiny, excitatory neurons. The most frequently encountered synaptic targets were spines (76% in layer 4, 98% in layer 2/3). The remainder of the synaptic targets were dendritic shafts, of which just less than half (44%) had the characteristic ultrastructure of smooth (inhibitory) cells. Multisynaptic boutons were rare (mean synapses per bouton for layer 4 1.2, for layer 2/3 1.1). The mean size of the postsynaptic densities found on spines (0.11 microm(2)) was not significantly different from that for dendrites (0.09 microm(2)). In terms of their type, laminar location, number, and targets, the synapses that formed the <BrainRegion>V2</BrainRegion> projection to <BrainRegion>V3 A</BrainRegion> are typical of a major, excitatory, feedforward projection of macaque visual cortex.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Localisation of cannabinoid CB(1) receptor immunoreactivity in the guinea pig and rat myenteric plexus.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Activation of cannabinoid CB(1) receptors inhibits gastrointestinal motility, propulsion, and transit, whereas selective antagonism of these receptors has the opposite effects, suggesting the presence of endocannabinoid tone. Supporting evidence for presynaptic CB(1) receptors on myenteric neurons has been found in vitro. In this study, selective CB(1) receptor antibodies and neuronal markers were used to identify and characterise myenteric neurons expressing cannabinoid receptors. Whole mounts of rat and guinea pig myenteric preparations were dually labelled with antibodies against the CB(1) receptor and choline acetyltransferase, neurofilament proteins, calbindin, calretinin, synapsin I, microtubule-associated protein-2, calcitonin gene-related peptide, or substance P. The pattern of CB(1) receptor labelling and the neurochemical classification of CB(1) receptor-positive cells were markedly influenced by the species and fixation procedure. Virtually all choline acetyltransferase-immunoreactive myenteric neurons expressed CB(1) receptors in ganglia from both species. Subpopulations of neurons identified with calbindin, calretinin, and microtubule-associated protein-2 did not express CB(1) receptors. A few calcitonin gene-related peptide- and substance P-positive somata coexpressed CB(1) receptor immunoreactivity but showed little colocalisation on individual fibres. There was a close association between CB(1) receptor immunoreactivity and fibres labelled for synaptic protein, suggesting a role in the modulation of transmitter release. Functional responses to cannabinoids in the presence of hexamethonium suggest further that CB(1) receptors occur on excitatory motoneurons. In conclusion, CB(1) receptors are expressed on a variety of cholinergic sensory, interneuronal, and motor neurons in myenteric ganglia.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Lobule structure and somatotopic organization of the medullary facial lobe in the channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Correlation of the somatotopic organization of the facial lobe (FL), a primary medullary gustatory nucleus in the channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus, with its lobular substructure was investigated to examine a possible structural basis for the excellent ability of ictalurid catfishes to localize a food source in the environment. The facial lobe(FL) in the channel catfish is composed of six longitudinal columns (i.e., lobules) extending rostrocaudally and differing from each other in their length and location within the lobe. Each lobule receives segregated input from discrete portions of the external body surface. The three more medial lobules in the facial lobe(FL) receive input (from medial to lateral) from the medial mandibular barbel, the lateral mandibular barbel, and the maxillary barbel, respectively. The proximal-distal axis of each of the barbels is represented in a posteroanterior lobule axis. The largest lobule, the face-flank lobule, is located dorsolaterally in the facial lobe(FL) , whereas the anteroposterior body axis is represented in the posteroanterior lobule axis. This indicates that the neural representation of the external body surface of the channel catfish faces caudally in the facial lobe(FL) . The two shortest lobules, positioned ventral to the face-flank lobule, receive input from the nasal barbel and the pectoral fin, respectively. The rostrocaudal dimensions of each of the barbel lobules correlate well with the relative lengths of the barbels. Taste-sensitive portions within the three barbel lobules examined were generally confined to the dorsal region, whereas tactile responses were observed throughout the lobules.2+ primarily tactile, zone.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Efferent projections from <BrainRegion>limbic cortex</BrainRegion> of the temporal pole to the <BrainRegion>magnocellular medial dorsal nucleus</BrainRegion> in the rhesus monkey.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The efferent projection from the <BrainRegion>rostral cortices of the temporal lobe</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>magnocellular division of the medial dorsal nucleus</BrainRegion> (MDmc) was studied in the rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta). The temporal pole region contains four architectonically defined <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> divisions. Medially, the <BrainRegion>allocortex of the temporal limb of the pyriform cortex</BrainRegion> is annexed to the <BrainRegion>temporal lobe neocortices</BrainRegion> at the <BrainRegion>limen insulae</BrainRegion>. Two transitional <BrainRegion>neocortices</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>periallocortical and proisocortical divisions</BrainRegion>, are situated subjacent to the <BrainRegion>pyriform area</BrainRegion>. They make up the largest part of the temporal tip and separate the <BrainRegion>pyriform cortex</BrainRegion> from the architecturally more progressive isocortical divisions of the pole found laterally at the rostral ends of the <BrainRegion>superior and inferior temporal gyri</BrainRegion>. Neuroanatomical tracers were injected into each of the major divisions of the <BrainRegion>temporal pole cortex</BrainRegion>, and the injection site locations were characterized cytoarchitectonically as well as geographically. Injections of tritiated amino acids into <BrainRegion>pyriform allocortex</BrainRegion> or into the transitional <BrainRegion>neocortical</BrainRegion> fields revealed an efferent projection to the <BrainRegion>magnocellular medial dorsal nucleus</BrainRegion>. The terminal field was characterized by a mosaic type of organization and contained discrete zones of axonal termination in which bursts of coarse label surrounded neuronal perikarya and their proximal dendrites. A similar projection was also observed when horseradish peroxidase was injected into the transitional <BrainRegion>cortices</BrainRegion>. However, perikarya participating in the terminal clusters were not retrogradely labeled. Intracortical injections restricted to <BrainRegion>lateral polar isocortex</BrainRegion> did not result in either anterograde or retrograde transport of label to <BrainRegion>magnocellular division of the medial dorsal nucleus</BrainRegion>(MDmc) . These findings demonstrate a nonreciprocal, corticofugal pathway to <BrainRegion>magnocellular division of the medial dorsal nucleus</BrainRegion>(MDmc) that originates in the phylogenetically older districts of the temporal pole. The conduction of <BrainRegion>limbic</BrainRegion> sensory information directly from <BrainRegion>temporal neocortex</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>medial thalamus</BrainRegion> may play a fundamental role in human and primate memory.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>The origin of postganglionic and sensory axons in the cervical sympathetic trunk of the cat: a horseradish peroxidase study.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The composition of the cervical sympathetic trunk (CST) in the cat is still not completely understood. The present study investigates, by the horseradish peroxidase (HRP) method of tracing neuronal connections, the presence of postganglionic and sensory neurons projecting via the cervical sympathetic trunk(CST) . Following sympathectomy at the midcervical level and the application of horseradish peroxidase(HRP) crystals to the cut ends of the cervical sympathetic trunk(CST) which had been isolated from the surrounding by a 1.5% solution of agar-agar, labelled neurons were seen in the superior cervical (SCG), stellate (SG), inferior vagal ganglia (IVG), and spinal ganglia C8-T8. The maximum number of labelled neurons was 536 in the SCG, 460 in the SG, 180 in the inferior vagal ganglia(IVG) , and 104 in spinal ganglia C8-T8.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Immunocytochemical survey of putative neurotransmitters in taste buds from Necturus maculosus.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>To investigate synaptic mechanisms in taste buds and collect information about synaptic transmission in these sensory organs, we have examined taste buds of the mudpuppy, Necturus maculosus for the presence of neurotransmitters and neuromodulators. Immunocytochemical staining at the light microscopic level revealed the presence of serotonin-like and cholecystokinin-like (CCK) immunoreactivity in basal cells in the taste bud. Nerve fibers innervating taste buds were immunoreactive for vasoactive intestinal peptide-like (VIP), substance P-like, and calcitonin gene-related peptide-like (CGRP) or compounds closely related to these substances. Immunoreactivity for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) in the taste cells and nerve fibers was absent. These data suggest that serotonin, cholecystokinin-like(CCK) , vasoactive intestinal peptide-like(VIP) , substance P, and calcitonin gene-related peptide-like(CGRP) are involved in synaptic transmission or neuromodulation in the peripheral organs of taste. No evidence was found for cholinergic or adrenergic mechanisms on the basis of the absence of immunocytochemical staining for key enzymes involved in these two transmitter systems.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Alterations of the crossed parabigeminotectal projection induced by neonatal eye removal in rats.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Projections of the <BrainRegion>parabigeminal nucleus</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>contralateral superior colliculus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion> were examined in normal adult pigmented rats and in adult rats from which one or both eyes had been removed at birth. In normal rats the crossed parabigeminotectal projection is restricted to the superficial layers in <BrainRegion>anterior and medial areas of colliculus</BrainRegion>, regions innervated also by the lower temporal portion of the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral retina</BrainRegion>. In unilaterally enucleated animals the crossed parabigeminotectal projection to the &quot;denervated" <BrainRegion>colliculus</BrainRegion> is expanded, as is the <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> projection from the ipsilateral eye. In addition, there is a crossed <BrainRegion>parabigeminal</BrainRegion> projection to the &quot;denervated" <BrainRegion>dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion> in these rats. In bilaterally enucleated animals the parabigeminotectal projection is expanded, but not as greatly as in unilateral enucleation cases; there is a crossed parabigeminothalamic projection in these animals as well. The corresponding termination patterns of the <BrainRegion>contralateral parabigeminal nucleus</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral retina</BrainRegion> in the normal <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion> may indicate a functional and/or developmental interdependence between the projections from these two regions. The existence of an expanded parabigeminotectal projection in bilaterally enucleated rats shows that a sustained ipsilateral retinotectal projection is not necessary for the establishment of a crossed parabigeminotectal projection, but points to the possibility that <BrainRegion>ipsilateral retinal</BrainRegion> input may constrain the <BrainRegion>parabigeminal</BrainRegion> projection to terminate within certain boundaries. The even greater expansion of the projection from the <BrainRegion>parabigeminal nucleus</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>colliculus</BrainRegion> which receives an expanded projection from the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral retina</BrainRegion> of unilaterally enucleated rats suggests that the functional organization of the ipsilateral retinotectal projection may be capable of restricting the size of the terminal field of the crossed parabigeminotectal projection.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Cholinergic axons in the rat <BrainRegion>ventral tegmental area</BrainRegion> synapse preferentially onto <BrainRegion>mesoaccumbens</BrainRegion> dopamine neurons.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Cholinergic afferents to the <BrainRegion>ventral tegmental area</BrainRegion> (VTA) contribute substantially to the regulation of motivated behaviors and the rewarding properties of nicotine. These actions are believed to involve connections with dopamine (DA) neurons projecting to the <BrainRegion>nucleus accumbens</BrainRegion> (NAc). However, this direct synaptic link has never been investigated, nor is it known whether cholinergic inputs innervate other populations of dopamine(DA) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurons, including those projecting to the <BrainRegion>prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion> (PFC). We addressed these questions by using electron microscopic analysis of retrograde tract-tracing and immunocytochemistry for the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) and for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) . In tissue labeled for tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) , vesicular acetylcholine transporter(VAChT) (+) terminals frequently synapsed onto dopamine(DA) <BrainRegion>mesoaccumbens</BrainRegion> neurons but only seldom contacted dopamine(DA) mesoprefrontal cells. In tissue labeled for gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) , one-third of vesicular acetylcholine transporter(VAChT) (+) terminals innervated gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) -labeled dendrites, including both <BrainRegion>mesoaccumbens</BrainRegion> and mesoprefrontal populations. vesicular acetylcholine transporter(VAChT) (+) synapses onto dopamine(DA) and <BrainRegion>mesoaccumbens</BrainRegion> neurons were more commonly of the asymmetric (presumed excitatory) morphological type, whereas vesicular acetylcholine transporter(VAChT) (+) synapses onto gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) cells were more frequently symmetric (presumed inhibitory or modulatory). These findings suggest that cholinergic inputs to the <BrainRegion>ventral tegmental area(VTA) mediate complex</BrainRegion> synaptic actions, with a major portion of this effect likely to involve an excitatory influence on dopamine(DA) <BrainRegion>mesoaccumbens</BrainRegion> neurons. As such, the results suggest that natural and drug rewards operating through cholinergic afferents to the <BrainRegion>ventral tegmental area</BrainRegion>(VTA) have a direct synaptic link to the <BrainRegion>mesoaccumbens</BrainRegion> dopamine(DA) neurons that modulate approach behaviors.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Cytoarchitectonic heterogeneities in the <BrainRegion>thalamic reticular nucleus</BrainRegion> of cats and ferrets.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The <BrainRegion>thalamic reticular nucleus</BrainRegion> has been classically defined as a group of cells surrounding most of the rostral and lateral surfaces of the <BrainRegion>dorsal thalamus</BrainRegion>, lateral to the fibres of the external <BrainRegion>medullary</BrainRegion> lamina and medial to those of the <BrainRegion>internal capsule</BrainRegion>. With the use of Nissl staining and antibodies to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), somatostatin, and parvalbumin, this study describes the cytoarchitecture of the <BrainRegion>thalamic reticular nucleus</BrainRegion> of cats and ferrets. In cats, three subdivisions of the nucleus are distinguished, two of which are distinct in ferrets also. First, the main body of the <BrainRegion>reticular nucleus</BrainRegion> lies lateral to the fibres of the external medullary lamina (except ventrally) and medial to those of the internal capsule. In both cats and ferrets, this structure is heterogeneous, consisting of distinct layers, the details of which vary along the dorsoventral axis. A prominent rostroventral portion of comparatively small rounded cells is also apparent within the main body. Most <BrainRegion>reticular</BrainRegion> cells in all areas of the main body are labelled with all of the above mentioned antibodies. Second, the inner small-celled region is a group of small cells located between the external <BrainRegion>medullary</BrainRegion> lamina (ventrally) and the medial margin of the ventral regions of the main body of the <BrainRegion>reticular nucleus</BrainRegion>: the inner small-celled region is clearly differentiated in cats only. Previous studies have referred to this area as being part of the main body of the <BrainRegion>reticular nucleus</BrainRegion>, but we suggest that it may form a separate subnucleus. For example, the inner small-celled region stands in striking contrast to the main body of the <BrainRegion>reticular nucleus</BrainRegion> in that none of its cells are gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) immunoreactive and only a small caudal subpopulation are parvalbumin immunoreactive. A very similar pattern of immunostaining is apparent for the cells in the <BrainRegion>zona incerta</BrainRegion>, although the latter contains a small rostral subpopulation of gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) immunoreactive cells. Furthermore, although morphologically distinct from the <BrainRegion>zona incerta</BrainRegion>, the inner small-celled region fuses with it ventrocaudally. We suggest that the inner small-celled region may constitute a previously undescribed dorsal extension of the <BrainRegion>zona incerta</BrainRegion>, rather than a subdivision of the <BrainRegion>reticular nucleus</BrainRegion>. Third, the <BrainRegion>perireticular nucleus</BrainRegion>, hitherto unidentified, is a discrete group of small cells lateral to the main body of the <BrainRegion>reticular nucleus</BrainRegion> and medial to the <BrainRegion>corpus striatum</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>globus pallidus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>caudate-putamen</BrainRegion>). It is apparent throughout most of the dorsoventral extent of the main body of the <BrainRegion>reticular nucleus</BrainRegion> of cats and ferrets.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Morphologic analysis and classification of ganglion cells of the chick <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> by intracellular injection of Lucifer Yellow and retrograde labeling with DiI.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText><BrainRegion>Retinal</BrainRegion> ganglion cells (RGCs) of chicks were labeled by using the techniques of intracellular filling with Lucifer Yellow and retrograde axonal labeling with carbocyanine dye (DiI). Labeled <BrainRegion>Retinal</BrainRegion> ganglion cells(RGCs) were morphologically analyzed and classified into four major groups: Group I cells (57.1%) with a small somal area (77.5 microm(2) on average) and narrow dendritic field (17,160 microm(2) on average), Group II cells (28%) with a middle-sized somal area (186 microm(2)) and middle-sized dendritic field (48,800 microm(2)), Group III cells (9.9%) with a middle-sized somal area (203 microm(2)) and wide dendritic field (114,000 microm(2)), and Group IV cells (5%) with a large somal area (399 microm(2)) and wide dendritic field (117,000 microm(2)). Of the four groups, Groups I and II were further subdivided into two types, simple and complex, on the basis of dendritic arborization: Groups Is, Ic, and Groups IIs, IIc. However, Group III and IV showed either a simple or complex type, Group IIIs and Group IVc, respectively. The density of branching points of dendrites was approximately 10 times higher in the complex types (18,350, 6,190, and 3,520 points/mm(2) in Group Ic, IIc, and IVc, respectively) than in the simple types (1,890, 640, and 480 points/mm(2) in Group Is, IIs, and IIIs). The branching density of Group I cells was extremely high in the central zone. The chick inner plexiform layer was divided into eight sublayers by dendritic strata of <BrainRegion>Retinal</BrainRegion> ganglion cells(RGCs) and 26 stratification patterns were discriminated. The central and peripheral <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> zones were characterized by branching density of dendrites and composition of RGC groups, respectively.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Glial patterns during early development of <BrainRegion>antennal lobes</BrainRegion> of Manduca sexta: a comparison between normal lobes and lobes deprived of antennal axons.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The synaptic neuropil of the <BrainRegion>olfactory (antennal) lobe</BrainRegion> of the moth Manduca sexta is subdivided into histologically conspicuous structures called glomeruli that are typical of olfactory systems in vertebrates and invertebrates. Each glomerulus consists of the highly branched neuritic arbors of both <BrainRegion>primary olfactory</BrainRegion> axons and <BrainRegion>antennal-lobe</BrainRegion> neurons, bounded by a nearly complete envelope of glial cells. We have studied events occurring during the first half of metamorphic adult development. The first signs of organization of the neuropil into glomeruli are changes in glial cells. Prior to the ingrowth of olfactory axons from the antenna, glial cells form a continuous border around the neuropil. When <BrainRegion>olfactory</BrainRegion> axons begin to reach the lobe, glial cells embark on a stereotyped series of changes: the border becomes disrupted, glial cells begin to proliferate and extend processes into the outer regions of the neuropil, and some glial cells migrate toward the center of the neuropil. Shortly thereafter, glomeruli emerge from the neuropil, delineated by glial cells. If, however, afferent axons are prevented from ever reaching the <BrainRegion>antennal lobe</BrainRegion>, glomeruli never develop and the glial cells remain almost entirely restricted to a thick layer bordering the neuropil. Thus sensory axons have a direct influence not only on neuronal but also on glial differentiation. Our results lead us to suggest that the glial cells may be in a position to act as intermediaries in developmental interactions between sensory axons and <BrainRegion>antennal-lobe</BrainRegion> neurons.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Nucleus retroambiguus-spinal</BrainRegion> pathway in the mouse: Localization, gender differences, and effects of estrogen treatment.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText><BrainRegion>Nucleus retroambiguus (NRA)-motoneuronal</BrainRegion> projections are species-specific and serve expiration, Valsalva maneuvers, vocalization, and sexual behavior. In cat and monkey, estrogen induces sprouting of <BrainRegion>Nucleus retroambiguus(NRA) -spinal</BrainRegion> axons. This pathway may thus serve as a model to study mechanisms through which estrogen induces neuronal plasticity. In this study, <BrainRegion>Nucleus retroambiguus(NRA) -spinal</BrainRegion> projections are described in adult mice by using anterograde and retrograde tracing techniques, with attention to gender, strain (CD-1 and C57BL/6), and estrogen-induced changes (in ovariectomized females). Labeled <BrainRegion>Nucleus retroambiguus(NRA) -spinal</BrainRegion> neurons at the level of the decussation of the corticospinal tract were most numerous after tracer injections into the <BrainRegion>thoracic and upper lumbar cord</BrainRegion>. They were medium-sized and had axons that descended through the <BrainRegion>contralateral cord</BrainRegion>. A group of small neurons was labeled in the <BrainRegion>Nucleus retroambiguus</BrainRegion>(NRA) immediately rostral to the decussation of the corticospinal tract after cervical and thoracic, but not after lumbar injections. This group projected mainly via an ipsilateral pathway. The main projections from the <BrainRegion>caudal Nucleus retroambiguus</BrainRegion>(NRA) involved motoneurons in the <BrainRegion>thoracic and upper-lumbar cord</BrainRegion> that supply abdominal wall and cremaster muscles. Pelvic floor motoneurons did not receive substantial input. <BrainRegion>Nucleus retroambiguus(NRA) -spinal</BrainRegion> projections, especially those involving the <BrainRegion>upper lumbar cord</BrainRegion>, were sexually dimorphic, being more extensive in males than in females. Moreover, they were more distinct in estrogen-treated females than in control females. Strain differences were not observed. The unique features of the <BrainRegion>caudal Nucleus retroambiguus(NRA) -spinal</BrainRegion> pathway in the mouse are discussed in the framework of possible functions of this system, such as mating behavior and related social behaviors, parturition, thermoregulation, and control of balance.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>The immunocytochemical localization of enkephalin in the central nervous system of the rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The immunocytochemical localization of enkephalin-like immunoreactivity (ELI) throughout the rat central nervous system (CNS) was investigated. The detection of enkephalin-like immunoreactivity(ELI) -containing structures was facilitated through the use of (1) brains from colchicine-treated rats, (2) the proteolytic pretreatment of sections with pronase and (3) the &quot;double-bridge" staining technique. Our findings confirm the presence of enkephalin-like immunoreactivity(ELI) in perikarya, neuronal processes and terminals in many areas of the central nervous system(CNS) . In addition, the localization of enkephalin-like immunoreactivity(ELI) -containing perikarya is reported for the first time in the following areas: the <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>olfactory tubercle</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>lateral preoptic nucleus</BrainRegion>, several nuclei within the <BrainRegion>amygdaloid nuclear complex</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>neocortex</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>cingulate cortex</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>posterior mammillary nucleus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>medial nucleus of the optic tract</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>brachium of the inferior colliculus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>ventral tegmental nucleus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>locus ceruleus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>sub-ceruleal region</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>lateral trapezoid nucleus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>nucleus reticularis lateralis</BrainRegion>, and lamina VII of the <BrainRegion>cervical spinal cord</BrainRegion>. Our results demonstrate enkephalin-like immunoreactivity(ELI) in neurons which are heterogeneous in size, some probably functioning as interneurons and others as projection neurons in different areas of the central nervous system(CNS) . The location of these neurons within the brain suggests that these pentapeptides serve diverse functions which include, in addition to nociception, the regulation of neuroendocrine, respiratory, auditory, vestibular, and olfactory functions.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Two types of corticopulvinar terminations: round (type 2) and elongate (type 1).</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Corticopulvinar axons were anterogradely labeled by Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin injections in the <BrainRegion>occipitotemporal cortex</BrainRegion> of the macaque to determine quantitative parameters of divergence and convergence, arbor size and shape, and distribution of terminal specializations. Forty individual axons were analyzed by serial section reconstruction and divided into two major groups. The majority of axons have numerous (typically 500-1,000) small, spinous endings (boutons terminaux). These axons have terminal fields that are beam-like or elongated (E, corresponding to classical type 1) and highly divergent (1.0-3.0 mm). These frequently innervate several of the traditionally designated <BrainRegion>pulvinar</BrainRegion> subdivisions; namely <BrainRegion>inferior pulvinar</BrainRegion> (PI) and the <BrainRegion>ventral part of interal pulvinar</BrainRegion> (PL); <BrainRegion>medial pulvinar</BrainRegion> (PM) and <BrainRegion>dorsal pulvinar</BrainRegion>(PL) , and (one axon) PM, <BrainRegion>dorsal pulvinar</BrainRegion>(PL) , and <BrainRegion>pulvinar</BrainRegion>(PI) . Some axons, however (R or round, corresponding to classical type 2), have a small number (typically 70-160) of primarily large, beaded endings (boutons en passant), which concentrate in sharply delimited, round arbors (diameters 100-125 microns). R axons appear to be larger caliber than E axons (1.0-1.5 microns vs. 0.5-1.0 micron, respectively). These differences in phenotype are probably associated with distinct types of projection neurons. In visual areas, corticopulvinar terminations are reported to originate from pyramidal cell subpopulations in layer 5. Indirect evidence, presented here, suggests that the more numerous medium-sized neurons give rise to E axons, and the sparser giant pyramids give rise to R corticopulvinar axons. If this is correct, corticopulvinar connectivity may be involved in multiple transformations. Spatially, axons of giant neurons (with basal dendrites that collect intracortically from a disc-like area, about 1.0 mm in diameter) converge onto a small number of <BrainRegion>pulvinar</BrainRegion> neurons. Axons of medium neurons (with basal dendrites that occupy a small intracortical disc, about 0.3 mm in diameter) diverge over 1.0-3.0 mm in the <BrainRegion>pulvinar</BrainRegion> and may form many contacts. Giant neurons, although numerically few in relation to medium pyramids (1 or 2: 50?), are likely to have distinctive membrane properties (functionally equivalent to bursting neurons?). Their larger boutons and axon caliber may be associated with a faster transmission that compensates for their small numbers. In primates, the E and R duality does not characterize <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> projections to the <BrainRegion>caudate</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>pons</BrainRegion>, or <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion> and thus may be essentially linked to <BrainRegion>pulvinar</BrainRegion>-specific processes.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Gracile projection to the cat <BrainRegion>medial accessory olive</BrainRegion>: ultrastructural termination patterns and convergence with spino-olivary projection.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The <BrainRegion>caudal medial accessory subdivision of the inferior olive</BrainRegion> (cMAO) receives information from the hindlimb from both the <BrainRegion>gracile nucleus</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>lumbosacral spinal cord</BrainRegion>. This study determined which elements in <BrainRegion>caudal medial accessory subdivision of the inferior olive</BrainRegion>(cMAO) serve as the postsynaptic targets of the gracile projection and whether these elements also receive input from the <BrainRegion>lumbosacral spinal cord</BrainRegion>. Gracile axons were labeled in cats by anterograde transport of wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP), visualized with tetramethylbenzidine. Convergence of gracile and lumbosacral axons was evaluated by labeling in the same animal, one pathway by wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase(WGA-HRP) and the other by degeneration. In <BrainRegion>caudal medial accessory subdivision of the inferior olive</BrainRegion>(cMAO) , gracile axons synapse with equal probability on dendritic spines and distal dendritic shafts. This termination pattern contrasts markedly with that of other somatosensory inputs to the <BrainRegion>inferior olive</BrainRegion> and may account for the greater heterogeneity in responses to somatosensory stimuli displayed by neurons in <BrainRegion>caudal medial accessory subdivision of the inferior olive</BrainRegion>(cMAO) . The distal dendritic shafts receiving gracile input were more likely than dendritic spines to receive convergent input from putative inhibitory synapses. The most likely source of these inhibitory synapses is the <BrainRegion>parasolitary nucleus</BrainRegion>, a structure that has been shown by others to receive input from the <BrainRegion>cerebellum</BrainRegion>. Thus the <BrainRegion>parasolitary nucleus</BrainRegion> may serve as an inhibitory relay between the <BrainRegion>cerebellum</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>caudal medial accessory subdivision of the inferior olive</BrainRegion>(cMAO) . The dendritic spines in <BrainRegion>caudal medial accessory subdivision of the inferior olive</BrainRegion>(cMAO) that receive input from the <BrainRegion>gracile nucleus</BrainRegion> often receive additional input from the <BrainRegion>lumbosacral spinal cord</BrainRegion>. This convergence of somatosensory axons on dendritic spines may provide a mechanism through which the unusually complex receptive fields of neurons in <BrainRegion>caudal medial accessory subdivision of the inferior olive</BrainRegion>(cMAO) are generated.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Chemistry of the mind: neurochemical modulation of <BrainRegion>prefrontal cortical</BrainRegion> function.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The neurochemical modulation of <BrainRegion>prefrontal cortical</BrainRegion> function is reviewed with special reference to the ascending dopaminergic and serotoninergic projections. Evidence is surveyed from studies of rats, nonhuman primates, and humans to suggest that <BrainRegion>prefrontal</BrainRegion> dopamine has specific functions in attentional control and working memory, mediated mainly through the D1 receptor, whereas manipulations of serotonin are shown by contrast to affect reversal learning in monkeys and human volunteers and measures of impulsivity in rats. These findings are discussed in the context of these as well as other neurotransmitter systems (including noradrenaline and acetylcholine) having distinct roles in the neuromodulation of <BrainRegion>prefrontal cortical</BrainRegion> function. The capacity of the <BrainRegion>prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion> itself to exert top-down regulation of these ascending neurochemical systems is also discussed.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Differential effects of NGF and NT-3 on embryonic trigeminal axon growth patterns.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>We examined the effects of neurotrophins nerve growth factor (NGF) and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) on trigeminal axon growth patterns. Embryonic (E13-15) wholemount explants of the rat trigeminal pathway including the whisker pads, trigeminal ganglia, and <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion> were cultured in serum-free medium (SFM) or serum-free medium(SFM) supplemented with nerve growth factor(NGF) or neurotrophin-3(NT-3) for 3 days. Trigeminal axon growth patterns were analyzed with the use of lipophilic tracer DiI. In wholemount cultures grown in serum-free medium(SFM) , trigeminal axon projections, growth patterns, and differentiation of peripheral and central targets are similar to in vivo conditions. We show that in the presence of nerve growth factor(NGF) , central trigeminal axons leave the tract and grow into the surrounding <BrainRegion>brainstem regions</BrainRegion> in the elongation phase without any branching. On the other hand, neurotrophin-3(NT-3) promotes precocious development of short axon collaterals endowed with focal arbors along the sides of the central trigeminal tract. These neurotrophins also affect trigeminal axon growth within the whisker pad. Additionally, we cultured dissociated trigeminal ganglion cells in the presence of nerve growth factor(NGF) , neurotrophin-3(NT-3) , or nerve growth factor(NGF) + neurotrophin-3(NT-3) . The number of trigeminal ganglion cells, their size distribution under each condition were charted, and axon growth was analyzed following immunohistochemical labeling with TrkA and parvalbumin antibodies. In these cultures too, nerve growth factor(NGF) led to axon elongation and neurotrophin-3(NT-3) to axon arborization. Our in vitro analyses suggest that aside from their survival promoting effects, nerve growth factor(NGF) and neurotrophin-3(NT-3) can differentially influence axon growth patterns of embryonic trigeminal neurons.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Early development of the <BrainRegion>optic chiasm</BrainRegion> in the gray short-tailed opossum, Monodelphis domestica.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>We have studied the early development of the uncrossed retinofugal projection in the gray short-tailed opossum. Axons that form the adult uncrossed retinofugal projection arise from the temporal crescent of the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> and reach the <BrainRegion>optic chiasm</BrainRegion> on postnatal day 7. The sites at which the uncrossed fibres segregate from the crossed fibres and the pattern of this segregation are very different from those seen in eutherian mammals. In the opossum, the uncrossed fibres segregate from the crossed fibres within the <BrainRegion>juxtachiasmatic</BrainRegion> part of the <BrainRegion>optic nerve</BrainRegion> before they have encountered either the fibres of the other eye or midline structures of the <BrainRegion>ventral diencephalon</BrainRegion>. The uncrossed fibres turn perpendicular to the axis of the nerve and grow dorsoventrally through the crossed projection to gather as a discrete bundle at the ventral edge of the nerve. The abrupt divergence of the uncrossed fibres occurs at a border between two glial cell types: the interfascicular glia that characterise the main part of the <BrainRegion>optic nerve</BrainRegion> and the radial glia of the <BrainRegion>juxtachiasmatic</BrainRegion> part of the nerve. At the ventral part of the nerve, the bundle of uncrossed fibres turns caudally across the axis of the nerve and enters the ipsilateral optic tract. When retinofugal fibres encounter the border between the interfascicular and radial glia, a very specific axonal reorganisation occurs in marsupials, and this is strikingly different from the axonal reorganisation that occurs at the same site in eutherians, where essentially all retinofugal fibres reorganise, not just the uncrossed component. We believe this to be an important example of an identified cellular element that has quite distinct axon-guidance properties in different species.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Immunoelectron-microscopic study on the fine structure of substance-P-containing fibers in the taste buds of the rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The fine structure of substance-P-like immunoreactive [SPI] fibers in the taste buds of the circumvallate papillae of the rat tongue was investigated by means of electron microscopy using the unlabeled antibody-enzyme method. Outside the epithelium, SPI and non-SPI fibers are surrounded by the cytoplasm of Schwann cells. When the SPI fibers enter the epithelium, they immediately lose this cytoplasmic sheath and begin to traverse the taste buds. Though passing through the taste buds, no profiles suggesting clear synaptic contact between SPI fibers and underlying cells are identified. SPI terminals are filled with small synaptic vesicles and contain a few mitochondria. No SPI-positive structures are found in nerve endings that make synaptic contact with type III cells, the gustatory receptor cells.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Retinal</BrainRegion> pigment epithelial correlates of avian <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> degeneration: electron microscopic analysis.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The delayed amelanotic (DAM) strain of domestic chicken is characterized by an early, developmental onset of choroidal inflammation and destruction of both feather and choroidal melanocytes. Secondarily, <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> pigment epithelial (RPE) cells in the peripapillary region develop abnormalities, and a series of progressive histopathological changes ensues which includes reduction and ultimate loss of <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> pigment epithelial(RPE) -melanin granules and <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> pigment epithelial(RPE) -cell atrophy. The earliest sign of <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> pigment epithelial(RPE) -cell abnormality is a dramatic alteration in the distribution of intracellular melanin granules. Apical processes also show a lessening of contact with photoreceptor outer segments, leading in more advanced stages to their retraction and development of retinal detachments. Other progressive alterations in retinal pigment epithelial(RPE) cells include disorganization and loss of basal infoldings; size reductions and density increases in both mitochondria and myeloid bodies from early to advanced stages; appearance of large macrophages in the subretinal space; Loss of intercellular junctional complexes; and progressive reduction in the density of melanin granules. These abnormalities appear to spread in a cell-by-cell, radial pattern, until widespread areas of the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> become severely pathologic and atrophic. The delayed amelanotic(DAM) chorioretinal disorder appears to show many of the histopathologic features which characterize experimentally induced uveitis and other ocular diseases which may result from hypersensitivity to, or autoimmune reaction against, pigments of the uveal tract.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Immunoelectron-microscopic localization of the 180 kD component of the neural cell adhesion molecule N-CAM in postsynaptic membranes.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>In order to investigate the expression of cell adhesion molecules in synapses, we have studied the localization of the neural cell adhesion molecule N-CAM in the <BrainRegion>cerebellum</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion> of adult mice by immunocytological and immunochemical methods. Of the three molecular components of N-CAM with relative molecular masses (Mr) of 120, 140, and 180 kD, N-CAM 120 is not detectable in synaptosomal membranes, whereas N-CAM 140 is expressed on both pre- and postsynaptic membranes and N-CAM 180 is restricted to postsynaptic sites, with localization of the N-CAM 180-specific epitope in postsynaptic densities. Specificity of immunoreactivity is indicated by the observation that antibodies to the neural cell adhesion molecule L1 do not label synaptic membranes, whereas antibodies to two major components of postsynaptic densities, actin and erythrocyte spectrin, react with synaptic structures. Interestingly, N-CAM 180 is only detectable in subpopulations of synapses in the intact tissue. Isolated synaptosomes, opened for unimpeded accessibility of antibody by hypoosmotic treatment, also reveal a partial expression of N-CAM 180 in that 67% are labeled by antibodies to N-CAM 180, while antibodies to actin and erythrocyte spectrin react with 95% and 88% of all synaptosomes, respectively. N-CAM 180 does not appear to be differentially expressed in synapses of a particular morphological type, but is detectable in all types of synapses in the <BrainRegion>cerebellum</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion>, except for mossy fiber synapses and synapses between basket and Purkinje cells, which are generally N-CAM 180-negative. Since N-CAM 180 has been shown to be characteristic of stabilized or stabilizing cell contacts, possibly by its association with the cytoskeleton-membrane linker protein spectrin (Pollerberg et al.: J. Cell Biol. 101:1921-1929, &apos;85; Nature 324:462-465, '86; Cell Tissue Res. 250:227-236, '87), we would like to suggest N-CAM 180 plays an important role in determining the stability of contacts between pre- and postsynaptic membranes and state of synaptic activity.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Catecholamine-containing neurons in the sheep <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>diencephalon</BrainRegion>: immunohistochemical study with tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH) antibodies.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The present study describes the distribution and morphological characteristics of neurons and nerve fibers containing the catecholamine-synthesizing enzymes, tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine-beta-hydroxylase, in the sheep <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>diencephalon</BrainRegion> on the basis of immunohistochemical procedures. Neurons and fibers were considered to be dopaminergic if they showed anti-tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity, without corresponding anti-dopamine-beta-hydroxylase immunoreactivity. The structures labeled with both antisera were considered noradrenergic or adrenergic. The distribution of catecholaminergic neurons corresponds to that described by other authors with similar methods in the rat and in primates. The noradrenergic neurons belong to cell groups A1 to A7 and the dopaminergic neurons to cell groups A8 to A15. In almost all studied areas, the catecholaminergic innervation is similar to that observed in the other species. However, the central catecholaminergic systems of the sheep showed some specific characteristics: (1) groups A3 and A4, described in the rat, were not found, (2) group A14 contains fewer neurons than in the rat, (3) group A15 does not contain a dorsal but only a ventral portion, (4) there is a larger dispersion of neurons within each group, especially A6 and A7, than in rodents, and (5) there is a larger noradrenergic innervation of the catecholaminergic groups than in the other species.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Postembryonic production and aging in <BrainRegion>inner ear</BrainRegion> hair cells in sharks.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>In many animals the sensory hair cells of the <BrainRegion>inner ear</BrainRegion> are ultrastructurally variable within individual epithelia. This variation has been hypothetically related to both the function and the age of the individual cells. In this study, growth-related changes in hair cell populations were examined in the macula neglecta sensory epithelia of juvenile and adult sharks. Scanning electron microscopy demonstrated that more than 80% of the 200,000 hair cells in the adult&apos;s macula negecta are produced postembryonically. Tritiated thymidine autoradiography and histological descriptions of the hair cells in this sound detector indicate that new sensory cells are produced in growth zones at the edges of the epithelia. The hair cells in those zones have small cell bodies, small and heterogeneous cilia complexes, and associations with small numbers of particularly thin nerve terminals. Their cytological features and their sparse innervation contrast with the features of the more numerous central cells in each epithelium, but appear to resemble the published descriptions of embryonically developing hair cells. Thus, a germinal zone at the leading edge of sensory epithelium growth appears to persist into adult life in sharks. Published reports reinterpreted in light of this evidence suggest that such hair cell population growth may be expected in other anamniotes and that latent growth zones might persist in the ears of amniotes.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Somatotopic organization of vibrissae afferents in the <BrainRegion>trigeminal sensory nuclei</BrainRegion> of the rat studied by transganglionic transport of HRP.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Transganglionic transport of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) has been used to study the cell bodies and central projections of neurons innervating the vibrissae in the rat. These can be grouped into five horizontal rows and one posterior vertical row. Twenty-four to 48 hours after the nerves innervating different vibrissae were exposed to horseradish peroxidase(HRP) , the trigeminal ganglia, <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>upper cervical spinal cord</BrainRegion> were fixed by perfusion and serial sections were processed according to the tetramethylbenzidine technique. The results revealed a tendency for somatotopic organization in the trigeminal ganglion of cell bodies innervating the different vibrissae. Corresponding termination areas in the <BrainRegion>trigeminal sensory nuclei</BrainRegion> showed a detailed pattern of organization replicating the peripheral organization of the vibrissae. In all trigeminal sensory nuclei the horizontal rows are represented in an inverted fashion from dorsal to ventral, i.e., the most dorsal row is represented most ventrally. In addition, the more anterior a vibrissa is located, the deeper is it represented in the <BrainRegion>rostral nonlaminated nuclei</BrainRegion>. The situation is reversed in the <BrainRegion>laminated nucleus caudalis</BrainRegion>. The posterior vertical row is represented most superficially in the <BrainRegion>rostral nonlaminated nuclei</BrainRegion>, but most deeply in the <BrainRegion>laminated nucleus caudalis</BrainRegion>. In <BrainRegion>nucleus caudalis</BrainRegion> there are also rostrocaudal differences in the representation of different vibrissae. Thus, the posterior vibrissae in a horizontal row have their main representations more caudally than the anterior vibrissae. The posterior vertical row has its main representation most caudally, in the C1 segment.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Light and electron microscopic analysis of KChIP and Kv4 localization in rat <BrainRegion>cerebellar</BrainRegion> granule cells.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Potassium channels are key determinants of neuronal excitability. We recently identified KChIPs as a family of calcium binding proteins that coassociate and colocalize with Kv4 family potassium channels in mammalian brain (An et al. [2000] Nature 403:553). Here, we used light microscopic immunohistochemistry and multilabel immunofluorescence labeling, together with transmission electron microscopic immunohistochemistry, to examine the subcellular distribution of KChIPs and Kv4 channels in adult rat <BrainRegion>cerebellum</BrainRegion>. Light microscopic immunohistochemistry was performed on 40-microm free-floating sections using a diaminobenzidine labeling procedure. Multilabel immunofluorescence staining was performed on free-floating sections and on 1-microm ultrathin cryosections. Electron microscopic immunohistochemistry was performed using an immunoperoxidase pre-embedding labeling procedure. By light microscopy, immunoperoxidase labeling showed that Kv4.2, Kv4.3, and KChIPs 1, 3, and 4 (but not KChIP2) were expressed at high levels in <BrainRegion>cerebellar</BrainRegion> granule cells (GCs). Kv4.2 and KChIP1 were highly expressed in granule cells(GCs) in rostral cerebellum, whereas Kv4.3 was more highly expressed in granule cells(GCs) in <BrainRegion>caudal cerebellum</BrainRegion>. Immunofluorescence labeling revealed that KChIP1 and Kv4.2 are concentrated in somata of <BrainRegion>cerebellar</BrainRegion> granule cells and in synaptic glomeruli that surround synaptophysin-positive mossy fiber axon terminals. Electron microscopic analysis revealed that KChIP1 and Kv4.2 immunoreactivity is concentrated along the plasma membrane of cerebellar granule cell somata and dendrites. In synaptic glomeruli, KChIP1 and Kv4.2 immunoreactivity is concentrated along the granule cell dendritic membrane, but is not concentrated at postsynaptic densities. Taken together, these data suggest that A-type potassium channels containing Kv4.2 and KChIP1, and perhaps also KChIP3 and 4, play a critical role in regulating postsynaptic excitability at the cerebellar mossy-fiber/granule cell synapse.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Hippocampal</BrainRegion> tyrosine kinase A receptors are restricted primarily to presynaptic vesicle clusters.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Adult septohippocampal cholinergic neurons are dependent on trophic support for normal functioning and survival; these effects are largely mediated by the tyrosine kinase A receptor (TrkA), which binds its ligand, nerve growth factor (NGF), with high affinity. To determine the subcellular localization of tyrosine kinase A receptor(TrkA) within septohippocampal terminal fields, two rabbit polyclonal antisera to the extracellular domain of tyrosine kinase A receptor(TrkA) were localized immunocytochemically in rat <BrainRegion>dentate gyrus</BrainRegion> by light and electron microscopy. By light microscopy, tyrosine kinase A receptor(TrkA) immunoreactivity was found mostly in fine, varicose fibers primarily in the <BrainRegion>hilus</BrainRegion> and, to a lesser extent, in the granule cell and molecular layers. By electron microscopy, the central and infragranular regions of the <BrainRegion>hilus</BrainRegion> contained the highest densities of tyrosine kinase A receptor(TrkA) -immunoreactive profiles. Most tyrosine kinase A receptor(TrkA) -labeled profiles were axons (31% of 3,473), axon terminals (20%), and glia (38%); fewer were dendrites (6%), dendritic spines (5%), and granule cell and interneuron somata (&amp;lt;1%). tyrosine kinase A receptor(TrkA) immunolabeling in axons and axon terminals was discrete, often concentrated in patches of small synaptic vesicles that were adjacent to somatic and dendritic profiles. tyrosine kinase A receptor(TrkA) -labeled terminals formed both asymmetric and symmetric synapses, primarily with dendritic shafts and spines. tyrosine kinase A receptor(TrkA) -immunoreactive glial profiles frequently apposed terminals contacting dendritic spines. The findings that presynaptic profiles contain tyrosine kinase A receptor(TrkA) immunolabeling in sites of vesicle accumulation suggest that nerve growth factor(NGF) binding to tyrosine kinase A receptor(TrkA) may influence transmitter release. The presence of tyrosine kinase A receptor(TrkA) immunoreactivity in somata, dendrites, and glia further suggests that cells within the <BrainRegion>dentate gyrus</BrainRegion> may take up nerve growth factor(NGF) .</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Pontocerebellar</BrainRegion> projections to the <BrainRegion>pyramis</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>copula pyramidis</BrainRegion> in the rat: evidence for a mediolateral topography.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>In this study, using the horseradish peroxidase (HRP) retrograde tracing technique, the <BrainRegion>pontocerebellar</BrainRegion> projection to the <BrainRegion>pyramis</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>copula pyramidis</BrainRegion> in the rat has been analyzed in a series of experiments which had been performed to study the olivocerebellar projection (Eisenman, &apos;81). Microinjections of horseradish peroxidase(HRP) were made in different mediolateral positions along the width of the <BrainRegion>pyramis</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>copula pyramidis</BrainRegion>. Injections situated within the <BrainRegion>pyramis</BrainRegion> but in different loci resulted in the retrograde labeling of primarily two bilateral (much heavier contralaterally) groups of <BrainRegion>pontine</BrainRegion> cells: a medial and a ventrolateral group, both situated in the <BrainRegion>caudal pontine nuclei</BrainRegion>. With injections in the intermediate region, i.e., the border between the <BrainRegion>pyramis</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>copula pyramidis</BrainRegion>, a different pattern of labeled cells is seen. In these cases the intermediate part of the <BrainRegion>caudal pontine nuclei</BrainRegion> contains labeled cells. Injections placed in the lateral parts of the <BrainRegion>copula pyramidis</BrainRegion> resulted in still another pattern of retrograde labeling. Injections in this region resulted in the presence of labeled cells in four <BrainRegion>pontine areas</BrainRegion>, three caudal groups, and one group in the <BrainRegion>rostral pontine nuclei</BrainRegion>. Two of the caudal groups overlap with, but extend more rostrally than, the regions containing labeled cells after pyramis injections. These data suggest the presence in the <BrainRegion>pyramis</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>copula pyramidis</BrainRegion> of three parasagittal zones of differing widths, each of which receives a mainly differential projection from the <BrainRegion>pontine nuclei</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>The localization of cytochrome oxidase in the <BrainRegion>LGN</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>striate cortex</BrainRegion> of postnatal kittens.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The distribution of cytochrome oxidase (C.O.) was examined in the <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion> of the kitten during the first postnatal month and compared with the adult pattern. During the first week, most of the cytochrome oxidase(C.O.) was localized within the perikarya of <BrainRegion>geniculate</BrainRegion> neurons. <BrainRegion>Perigeniculate</BrainRegion> neurons had darkly reactive dendrites as well as perikaya. A population of relatively large, darkly reactive neurons became distinguishable around the end of the first week, as the level of reactivity diminished to moderate-to-light within most medium and small neurons. On the basis of their relative size and pattern of distribution, most of the darkly reactive neurons are likely to represent ones that will later have class 1 morphology and develop Y receptive field properties. These cells normally undergo rapid growth earlier, and their growth is more adversely affected by early short-term monocular suture than other classes of less reactive geniculate neurons. Thus, in the LGN of developing kitten, cytochrome oxidase(C.O.) histochemistry may be used as a functional marker for future class 1 Y-cells. The reactivity of the neuropil gradually increases as synapses with dendrites mature. At the electronmicroscopic level the increased reactivity of the neuropil is due mainly to an increase in the number of reactive mitochondria localized within the growing dendrites. In the developing <BrainRegion>striate cortex</BrainRegion> of postnatal kittens dark reactivity is localized in the outer part of layer II for the first 2 weeks and then disappears. Dark reactivity gradually increases in layer IV after the third week. The changes in cytochrome oxidase(C.O.) reactivity accompany pathway-specific physiological and anatomical changes that occur during early postnatal development.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>The developmental morphology of Torpedo marmorata: electric organ--electrogenic phase.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The electrogenic developmental phase of the electric organ of Torpedo marmorata begins at 40 mm of embryo length and is characterized by a horizontal flattening of the vertically orientated myotubes. The first sign of this process is a rounding up of the ventral poles of the myotubes and a disassembly of the myofibrils located therein. Occurring concomitantly with this is a migration of the nuclei to the cell center which results in a horizontal plane of nuclei. Filament bundles are then found within the ventral cytoplasm often projecting upwards from the ventral plasma membrane. The filaments of the bundles are dimensionally similar to the myofilaments of muscle and it is suggested that the bundles play a role in cellular transformation. In contrast the dorsal pole of the cell appears to be integrated &quot;passively" with the final cell shape as no morphological correlates of a retraction process have been found. A canalicular system, composed of a complex network of irregular tubules and vacuoles, appears just below the dorsal plasma membrane characterizing this region of the cell. A mononucleated satellite cell population lies in close proximity to the dorsal surface of the differentiating cell and fusion between the two cell types occurs throughout development. Cell shape transformation is complete by 55 mm of embryo length and the intercolumnar nerves begin to invade the interelectrocyte space. The ingrowing neurites preferentially course along the ventral electrocyte surface establishing junctions similar to motor endplates.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Histochemical characterization of a <BrainRegion>neocortical</BrainRegion> projection of the <BrainRegion>nucleus locus coeruleus</BrainRegion> in the squirrel monkey.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Histochemical evidence is presented for a catecholamine-containing projection from the <BrainRegion>nucleus locus coeruleus</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>neocortex</BrainRegion> in the squirrel monkey. The innervation of <BrainRegion>superior temporal gyrus</BrainRegion> has been examined in particular. Glyoxylic acid-induced fluorescence shows an extensive arborization of fine, catecholamine-containing fibers with prominent varicosities in all layers of the <BrainRegion>neocortex</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>nucleus locus coeruleus</BrainRegion> is identified as a source of these fibers by both ortho- and retrograde axonal tracing techniques. After injection of horseradish peroxidase into the <BrainRegion>neocortex</BrainRegion>, labelled cell bodies are localized throughout the major portions of the <BrainRegion>locus coeruleus</BrainRegion>. Conversely, after microinjection into the <BrainRegion>nucleus locus coeruleus</BrainRegion>, tritiated proline is transported into the <BrainRegion>neocortex</BrainRegion> where it appears within fibers similar in distribution to those revealed by fluorescence histochemistry. Both transport techniques indicate that <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> projections of the <BrainRegion>locus coerculeus</BrainRegion> originate from both ipsilateral and contralateral nuclei.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Ventral mesopontine</BrainRegion> projections of the caudomedial shell of the <BrainRegion>nucleus accumbens</BrainRegion> and extended <BrainRegion>amygdala</BrainRegion> in the rat: double dissociation by organization and development.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The shell of the <BrainRegion>nucleus accumbens</BrainRegion> and central division of the extended <BrainRegion>amygdala</BrainRegion> are <BrainRegion>telencephalic</BrainRegion> structures that influence motor activity and lately have been regarded by some as components of a single functional-anatomic continuum. Each has a highly differentiated internal organization and output system and distinct pharmacologic responses however, and it is thus likely that each subserves distinct contributions to behavior. In this investigation, <BrainRegion>nucleus accumbens</BrainRegion> and extended <BrainRegion>amygdala</BrainRegion> outputs were compared by using retrograde tracing in adult and postnatal rats. Fluoro-Gold, when injected into the <BrainRegion>ventral tegmental area</BrainRegion>, produced substantial retrograde labeling in the adult <BrainRegion>nucleus accumbens</BrainRegion> shell, but only trivial amounts in the central division of the <BrainRegion>extended amygdala</BrainRegion>. Injection sites in the <BrainRegion>lateral mesopontine tegmentum</BrainRegion> produced robust labeling in the <BrainRegion>central extended amygdala</BrainRegion> but little in the <BrainRegion>nucleus accumbens</BrainRegion>. The projections of <BrainRegion>extended amygdala</BrainRegion> were substantially developed by postnatal day 1, whereas those of the <BrainRegion>caudomedial shell of the nucleus accumbens</BrainRegion> only reached the <BrainRegion>ventral tegmental area</BrainRegion> by approximately postnatal day 6. Few neurons projecting from the <BrainRegion>caudomedial shell of the accumbens</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>ventral tegmental area</BrainRegion> were observed even at postnatal day 21. In consideration of the reported importance of the <BrainRegion>nucleus accumbens</BrainRegion>, particularly the caudomedial shell, in neural processing related to reward and motivation and the central nervous system response to antipsychotic drugs, it may be important to determine whether processes occurring during the protracted postnatal development of the caudomedial shell are vulnerable to destructive circumstances, such as drug intoxication, maternal separation, or social isolation.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Structure of the vertical and horizontal system neurons of the lobula plate in Drosophila.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The lobula plate in the <BrainRegion>optic lobe</BrainRegion> of the fly brain is a high-order processing center for visual information. Within the lobula plate lie a small number of giant neurons that are responsible for the detection of wide field visual motion. Although the structure and motion sensitivity of these cells have been extensively described in large flies, the system has not been described systematically in Drosophila. Here, we use the mosaic analysis with a repressible cell marker (MARCM) system to analyze a subset of these cells, the horizontal and vertical systems. Our results suggest that the Drosophila horizontal system is similar to those described in larger flies, with three neurons fanning their dendrites over the lobula plate. We found that there are six neurons in the Drosophila vertical system, a figure that compares with 9-11 neurons in large flies. Even so, the Drosophila vertical system closely resembles the systems of larger flies, with each neuron in Drosophila having an approximate counterpart in large flies. This anatomical similarity implies that the inputs to the vertical system are similarly organized in these various fly species, and that it is likely that the Drosophila neurons respond to motions similar to those sensed by their specific structural counterparts in large flies. Additionally, the similar appearance of vertical system cells in multiple cell clones demonstrates that they share a common developmental lineage. Access to these cells in Drosophila should allow for the use of genetic tools in future studies of horizontal and vertical system function.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>beta-Endorphin and gonadotropin-releasing hormone synaptic input to gonadotropin-releasing hormone neurosecretory cells in the male rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Physiological and pharmacological evidence has suggested that both endogenous opiates and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) itself can act centrally to exert a tonic inhibition on gonadotropin secretion via an inhibition of the neurosecretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone(GnRH) . To determine if the effects of these two peptides might be mediated via a direct synaptic input to the gonadotropin-releasing hormone(GnRH) neuron, we undertook a double label ultrastructural study. We were able to localize in the same tissue section beta-endorphin and gonadotropin-releasing hormone(GnRH) . Analysis of serial sections through gonadotropin-releasing hormone(GnRH) perikarya and dendrites in the male rat diagonal band/preoptic area revealed that almost 10% of the synapses impinging on the gonadotropin-releasing hormone(GnRH) neuron contained beta-endorphin; an additional 10% of the terminals contained gonadotropin-releasing hormone(GnRH) . These data provide anatomical evidence in support of both a direct modulation of gonadotropin-releasing hormone(GnRH) release by opiates and of the presence of an ultrashort feedback loop.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Selective retrograde transport of nipecotic acid, a GABA analog, labels a subpopulation of gerbil olivocochlear neurons.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Perfusion of the gerbil <BrainRegion>cochlea</BrainRegion> with micromolar quantities of 3H-gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) results in rapid, selective labeling of 50-60% of the olivocochlear (OC) efferent terminals on afferent dendrites beneath the inner hair cells, and all of the efferent terminals beneath the outer hair cells. In order to identify the neurons from which these 3H-gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) -accumulating terminals originate, the cell bodies were localized by using retrograde transport of 3H-nipecotic acid, a metabolically inert 3H-gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) analog. With survival times of 6-30 hours after <BrainRegion>cochlear</BrainRegion> injection, myelinated olivocochlear(OC) efferent fibers and cell bodies were well labeled, with the greatest number being labeled at 12-18 hours. All of the labeled neurons belonged to the <BrainRegion>medial olivocochlear</BrainRegion>(OC) system, and no <BrainRegion>lateral olivocochlear</BrainRegion>(OC) neurons were labeled. It is concluded that the 3H-gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) -accumulating endings in the gerbil <BrainRegion>cochlea</BrainRegion> arise from <BrainRegion>medial olivocochlear</BrainRegion>(OC) neurons, and therefore that <BrainRegion>medial olivocochlear</BrainRegion>(OC) efferent neurons in this species project to both inner and outer hair cell regions.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Quantitative morphometry of <BrainRegion>hippocampal</BrainRegion> pyramidal cells: differences between anatomical classes and reconstructing laboratories.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The dendritic trees of <BrainRegion>hippocampal</BrainRegion> pyramidal cells play important roles in the establishment and regulation of network connectivity, synaptic plasticity, and firing dynamics. Several laboratories routinely reconstruct <BrainRegion>CA3</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>CA1</BrainRegion> dendrites to correlate their three-dimensional structure with biophysical, electrophysiological, and anatomical observables. To integrate and assess the consistency of the quantitative data available to the scientific community, we exhaustively analyzed 143 completely reconstructed neurons intracellularly filled and digitized in five different laboratories from 10 experimental conditions. Thirty morphometric parameters, including the most common neuroanatomical measurements, were extracted from all neurons. A consistent fraction of parameters (11 of 30) was significantly different between <BrainRegion>CA3</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>CA1</BrainRegion> cells. A considerably large number of parameters was also found that discriminated among neurons within the same morphological class, but reconstructed in different laboratories. These interlaboratory differences (8 of 30 parameters) far outweighed the differences between experimental conditions within a single lab, such as aging or preparation method (at most two significant parameters). The set of morphometrics separating anatomical regions and that separating reconstructing laboratories were almost entirely nonoverlapping. <BrainRegion>CA3</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>CA1</BrainRegion> neurons could be distinguished by global quantities such as branch order and Sholl distance. Differences among laboratories were largely due to local variables such as branch diameter and local bifurcation angles. Only one parameter (a ratio of branch diameters) separated both morphological classes and reconstructing laboratories. Compartmental simulations of electrophysiological activity showed that both differences between anatomical classes and reconstructing laboratories could dramatically affect the firing rate of these neurons under different experimental conditions.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Functional expression of the peptide transporter PEPT2 in the mammalian enteric nervous system.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The peptide transporter PEPT2 mediates transmembrane uptake of small peptides. So far, its expression has not been evidenced in the gastrointestinal tract. We have investigated peptide transport activity in the neuromuscular layers of the gastrointestinal tract by using the fluorescent tracer-dipeptide beta-Ala-Lys-Nepsilon-7-amino-4-methyl-coumarin-3-acetic acid (Ala-Lys-AMCA). Whole-mount preparations from mouse, rat, and guinea pig stomach and small and large intestine were incubated with beta-Ala-Lys-Nepsilon-7-amino-4-methyl-coumarin-3-acetic acid(Ala-Lys-AMCA) in the presence or absence of the uptake-inhibitors L-histidine, D-phenylalanyl-L-alanine (D-Phe-Ala), glycyl-L-sarcosine (Gly-Sar), glycyl-L-glutamine (Gly-Gln), benzylpenicillin, and cefadroxil. Fluorescence microscopy revealed that beta-Ala-Lys-Nepsilon-7-amino-4-methyl-coumarin-3-acetic acid(Ala-Lys-AMCA) specifically accumulated in both ganglionic layers of the enteric nervous system (ENS) in all regions and species studied. This could be inhibited by glycyl-L-sarcosine(Gly-Sar) , D-phenylalanyl-L-alanine(D-Phe-Ala) , glycyl-L-glutamine(Gly-Gln) , and cefadroxil, but not by free histidine and benzylpenicillin, indicating uptake via PEPT2. Accordingly, dipeptide uptake was completely abolished in PEPT2-deficient mice. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis detected a PEPT2-specific transcript in extracts from the ganglionic enteric nervous system(ENS) layers of mouse small and large intestine, further proving that enteric dipeptide transport activity is specifically mediated via PEPT2. The cellular site of dipeptide uptake was immunohistochemically localized to enteric glial cells and tissue-resident macrophages. In addition, dipeptide uptake occurred in a neurochemically defined subset of neurons in the guinea pig enteric nervous system(ENS) . Our results constitute the first functional evidence for dipeptide transport activity in the enteric nervous system(ENS) . PEPT2-mediated dipeptide transport in enteric glia could contribute to the clearance of neuropeptides in the enteric nervous system(ENS) . In addition, the fluorophore-coupled dipeptide uptake via PEPT2 is a novel vital marker for glial cells in the enteric nervous system(ENS) .</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>An extralemniscal component of the mustached bat <BrainRegion>inferior colliculus</BrainRegion> selective for direction and rate of linear frequency modulations.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Frequency modulations (FMs) are prevalent in human speech, and are important acoustic cues for the categorical discrimination of phonetic contrasts. For bats, FM sweeps are also important for communication and are often the only component in echolocation calls. Auditory neurons tuned to the direction and rate of FM might underlie the encoding of rapid frequency transitions. In the mustached bat, we have discovered a population of such FM selective cells in an area interposed between the <BrainRegion>central nucleus of the inferior colliculus</BrainRegion> (ICC) and the <BrainRegion>nuclei of the lateral lemniscus</BrainRegion> (NLL). We believe this area to be the ventral extent of the <BrainRegion>external nucleus of the inferior colliculus</BrainRegion> (ICXv). To describe FM selectivity of neurons in the <BrainRegion>ICXv</BrainRegion> and to compare it to other midbrain <BrainRegion>nuclei</BrainRegion>, up- and down-sweeping linear FM stimuli were presented at different modulation rates. Extracellular recordings were made from 171 single units in the <BrainRegion>inferior colliculus</BrainRegion>(ICC) , <BrainRegion>ICXv</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>nuclei of the lateral lemniscus</BrainRegion>(NLL) of 10 mustached bats. In the <BrainRegion>ICXv</BrainRegion>, there was a much higher degree of FM selectivity than in <BrainRegion>inferior colliculus</BrainRegion>(ICC) or <BrainRegion>nuclei of the lateral lemniscus</BrainRegion>(NLL) and a consistent preference for upward over downward FM sweeps. Anterograde and retrograde transport was examined following focal injections of wheatgerm agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) into <BrainRegion>ICXv</BrainRegion>. The main targets of anterograde transport were the deep layers of the <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>suprageniculate division of the medial geniculate body</BrainRegion>. The primary site of retrograde transport was the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the central acoustic tract in the brainstem</BrainRegion>. Thus, the <BrainRegion>ICXv</BrainRegion> appears to be a part of the central acoustic tract, an extralemniscal pathway linking the <BrainRegion>auditory brainstem</BrainRegion> directly to a <BrainRegion>multimodal nucleus of the thalamus</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Sex differences in the gross size of the rat <BrainRegion>neocortex</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The pervasiveness of sex differences in the size of the rat <BrainRegion>cerebral cortex</BrainRegion> was investigated in ten littermate pairs of socially housed Long-Evans hooded rats at 90 days of age. Overall, the <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion> was longer and wider in male than in female rats. Sex differences were detected in most <BrainRegion>cortical regions</BrainRegion> with this sample size; the exception was the <BrainRegion>temporal cortex</BrainRegion>. While some asymmetries were found, they did not vary with the sex of the animal nor were they consistently in one direction. The contribution of the <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> layers to sex differences in <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> thickness was examined in four locations: the <BrainRegion>primary motor cortex</BrainRegion>, the forelimb area of the <BrainRegion>sensorimotor cortex</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>monocular and the binocular areas of the visual cortex</BrainRegion>. The layers that showed sex differences varied among the areas but were confined to layers II-III, V and VI. Sex differences in <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> size were widespread in the adult rat but showed some regional and laminar specificity.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Topography of projections from the <BrainRegion>auditory cortex</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>inferior colliculus</BrainRegion> in the rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>We examined the organization of descending projections from <BrainRegion>auditory and adjacent cortical areas</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>inferior colliculus</BrainRegion> (IC) in the rat by using the retrograde and anterograde transport of wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase. Small tracer injections were placed into cytologically defined <BrainRegion>subnuclei of the inferior colliculus</BrainRegion>(IC) . On the basis of the resulting pattern of retrogradely labeled neurons in the <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion>, different <BrainRegion>cortical areas</BrainRegion> and fields were defined. Two secondary areas located ventrocaudally (<BrainRegion>Te2</BrainRegion>) and ventrally (<BrainRegion>Te3)</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>primary auditory area</BrainRegion> (Te1) were delineated. The <BrainRegion>primary auditory area</BrainRegion> was subdivided into a <BrainRegion>posterior (Te1.p)</BrainRegion>, a <BrainRegion>medial (Te1.m)</BrainRegion>, and an <BrainRegion>anterior (Te1.a) auditory field</BrainRegion>. In addition, we outlined an area located rostrally to the auditory areas comprising a part of the <BrainRegion>secondary somatosensory cortex</BrainRegion>, as well as a dorsal belt surrounding dorsally the auditory areas. The following basic patterns of corticocollicular projections are revealed: 1) layers 2 and 3 of the <BrainRegion>dorsal cortex of the inferior colliculus</BrainRegion>(IC) (<BrainRegion>DC2</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>DC3</BrainRegion>) are differentially innervated by the <BrainRegion>primary auditory fields</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>Te1.p</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>Te1.a</BrainRegion> project bilaterally to <BrainRegion>DC2</BrainRegion>, while <BrainRegion>Te1.m</BrainRegion> projects bilaterally and in topographical order to <BrainRegion>DC3</BrainRegion>); cells in <BrainRegion>Te1.m</BrainRegion>, arranged in caudal to rostral sequence, project to corresponding loci in <BrainRegion>DC3</BrainRegion> arranged from dorsolateral to ventromedial; 2) the fibrocellular capsule of the <BrainRegion>inferior colliculus</BrainRegion>(IC) , comprising layer 1 of the <BrainRegion>dorsal and external cortex of the inferior colliculus</BrainRegion>(IC) , receives input from the <BrainRegion>secondary auditory area Te2</BrainRegion>; 3) layers 2 and 3 of the <BrainRegion>external cortex of the inferior colliculus</BrainRegion>(IC) are only weakly innervated by the <BrainRegion>primary and secondary auditory cortex</BrainRegion>; 4) the <BrainRegion>intercollicular zone</BrainRegion> receives its major input from the <BrainRegion>secondary auditory area Te3</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>secondary somatosensory cortex</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>dorsal belt</BrainRegion>; and 5) finally, the <BrainRegion>central nucleus of the inferior colliculus</BrainRegion>(IC) receives no input from the <BrainRegion>temporal cortex</BrainRegion> at all. Our results demonstrate that the corticocollicular projections are highly organized. These pathways may modulate auditory processing in different functional circuits of the <BrainRegion>inferior colliculus</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Corticopontine remodelling after <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> and/or <BrainRegion>cerebellar</BrainRegion> lesions in newborn rats.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The distribution of corticopontine projections was studied, primarily with the Fink-Heimer technique, in adult rats which at 2-3 days of age had sustained unilateral <BrainRegion>sensorimotor (SMC) or occipital (OC) cortical</BrainRegion> lesions and in animal that had received neonatal <BrainRegion>hemocerebellar</BrainRegion> (HCb) lesions singly or in combination with the neonatal <BrainRegion>SMC</BrainRegion> or <BrainRegion>occipital</BrainRegion>(OC) lesions. Neonatal <BrainRegion>left SMC</BrainRegion> or <BrainRegion>left hemocerebellar</BrainRegion>(HCb) lesions induced an anomalous increase in crossed sensorimotor corticopontine (SMP) projections originating from the <BrainRegion>right SMC</BrainRegion>. This increase appeared more dense after <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> lesions as compared to <BrainRegion>cerebellar</BrainRegion> lesions and appeared more dense in those animals receiving the combined <BrainRegion>SMC</BrainRegion> plus <BrainRegion>hemocerebellar</BrainRegion>(HCb) lesions. No alterations in the distribution of sensorimotor corticopontine(SMP) fibers were observed after neonatal <BrainRegion>occipital</BrainRegion>(OC) lesions nor were any alterations of occipital corticopontine (OP) fibers observed in any of the neonatal lesion groups. The remodelling of right sensorimotor corticopontine(SMP) projections after neonatal <BrainRegion>left SMC</BrainRegion> lesions demonstrates an interaction between corresponding pathways originating from opposite sides of the brain and which occurs in response to the partial removal of afferents to <BrainRegion>pontine gray</BrainRegion> neurons as a result of the <BrainRegion>SMC</BrainRegion> lesions. In contrast, the absence of sensorimotor corticopontine<BrainRegion>(</BrainRegion>SMP) plasticity after <BrainRegion>occipital</BrainRegion>(OC) lesions, and vice versa, demonstrates the absence of plasticity between pathways which differ anatomically and functionally. The substantial neuronal loss which occurs within the <BrainRegion>right PG</BrainRegion> after neonatal <BrainRegion>left hemocerebellar</BrainRegion>(HCb) lesions is believed to influence the increase in crossed sensorimotor corticopontine(SMP) fibers coursing from the right hemisphere to the larger <BrainRegion>left PG</BrainRegion>. No increase in crossed occipital corticopontine(OP) fibers from the right hemisphere was observed in these animals. The increase in crossed sensorimotor corticopontine(SMP) fibers after neonatal SMC lesions combined with neonatal <BrainRegion>hemocerebellar</BrainRegion>(HCb) lesions is more dense than found in the single lesion groups. These findings suggest that separate mechanisms of plasticity might be operational for each lesion and that these mechanisms may be additive.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Further observations on the <BrainRegion>cerebellar</BrainRegion> projections from the <BrainRegion>pontine nuclei</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis</BrainRegion> in the rhesus monkey.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The projections from the <BrainRegion>pontine nuclei</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>necleus reticularis tegmenti pontis</BrainRegion> (N.r.t.) onto the <BrainRegion>flocculus</BrainRegion>, uvula, and the <BrainRegion>paramedian lobule</BrainRegion> were studied with retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase n the rhesus monkey. The main findings are as follows: There is a conspicuous tendency for labeled cells to occur in numerous discrete clusters in the <BrainRegion>pontine nuclei</BrainRegion> after injections of these parts of the <BrainRegion>cerebellum</BrainRegion>. There appears to be very limited overlap between <BrainRegion>pontine</BrainRegion> cell groups projecting to the <BrainRegion>flocculus</BrainRegion>, the uvula, and the <BrainRegion>paramedian lobule</BrainRegion>, respectively. The <BrainRegion>flocculus</BrainRegion> appears to receive a substantial projection from the <BrainRegion>pontine nuclei</BrainRegion>. The projection is almost totally crossed (3% ipsilateral), and arises mainly laterally in the <BrainRegion>rostral half of the pons</BrainRegion> but in addition from a minor group dorsomedially. The <BrainRegion>flocculus</BrainRegion> receives a bilateral projection (slight contralateral preponderance) from <BrainRegion>medial and dorsomedial parts of the NRT</BrainRegion>. The number of labeled cells in the <BrainRegion>NRT</BrainRegion> was 13% of the number in the <BrainRegion>pontine nuclei</BrainRegion>. the uvula is amply supplied from the <BrainRegion>pontine nuclei</BrainRegion>. The projection takes origin throughout the <BrainRegion>rostrocaudal extent of the pons</BrainRegion>, from one medial and one dorsolateral region. Labeled cells are found in greatest number dorsolaterally in the <BrainRegion>rostral half of the pons</BrainRegion>. In the <BrainRegion>caudal necleus reticularis tegmenti pontis</BrainRegion>(N.r.t.) , one medial and one lateral cell group were labeled after injection of the uvula. The number of labeled cells in the <BrainRegion>necleus reticularis tegmenti pontis</BrainRegion>(N.r.t.) was only 4% of the number in the <BrainRegion>pontine nuclei</BrainRegion>. Findings with regard to the <BrainRegion>paramedian lobule</BrainRegion> confirm and extend earlier observations in the monkey (Brodal, &apos;79, '80). The present results are discussed in relation to HRP studies of the <BrainRegion>pontocerebellar</BrainRegion> projection in lower animals. Several possible species differences are noted--for example, with regard to projections to the <BrainRegion>flocculus</BrainRegion>. There is some evidence that the <BrainRegion>pontocerebellar</BrainRegion> projection is more precisely organized in the monkey than in lower animals.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Localization of the AMPA subunit GluR2 in the outer plexiform layer of goldfish <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>L-glutamate, the photoreceptor neurotransmitter, depolarizes horizontal cells and OFF bipolar cells by ionotropic AMPA-glutamate receptors. The AMPA-receptor subunit (GluR4) is localized to dendrites of OFF bipolar cells in goldfish <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>. Here, we used immunohistochemical techniques to identify AMPA-receptor subunits on horizontal cell dendrites. A monoclonal antibody against rat GluR2, with high sequence homology to the recently cloned goldfish GluR2a receptor, was used for light- and electron-microscopical immunocytochemistry. Light- and dark-adapted <BrainRegion>retinas</BrainRegion> were analyzed, with no major difference in results. GluR2-immunoreactivity (IR) was restricted to a narrow band in the outer plexiform layer, in which it appeared as bright dome-shaped structures amidst numerous puncta. At the ultrastructural level, GluR2- GluR2-immunoreactivity(IR) was found in horizontal cell dendrites that invaginated cones and rods. Dendrites of OFF bipolar cells were not labeled. GluR2- GluR2-immunoreactivity(IR) was present mostly in horizontal cell dendrites that were the lateral elements of the triad, rather than in dendrites that were the central elements. In light-adapted <BrainRegion>retinas</BrainRegion>, GluR2- GluR2-immunoreactivity(IR) was found in many horizontal cell spinules. GluR2- GluR2-immunoreactivity(IR) was observed, on occasion, in a mixed rod/cone (Mb) ON bipolar cell process that innervated rod spherules. Verification of the Mb ON bipolar cell was made by protein kinase C and metabotropic mGluR1alpha immunolabeling. The presence of GluR2- GluR2-immunoreactivity(IR) in lateral elements suggests that lateral horizontal cell dendrites are postsynaptic to cones rather than only sites of feedback inhibition. All horizontal cell types express the GluR2 subunit, uniquely differentiating themselves from OFF bipolar cells that express the GluR4 subunit. This differentiation most likely has a major influence on the glutamate pharmacology and response kinetics of these cell types to glutamate.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Amygdalopetal</BrainRegion> projections in the cat. I. <BrainRegion>Cortical</BrainRegion> afferent connections. A study with retrograde and anterograde tracing techniques.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> afferent connections of the <BrainRegion>amygdaloid complex</BrainRegion> of the cat have been studied by means of retrograde tracing of horseradish peroxidase and the fluorescent substances bisbenzimid and nuclear yellow. Subsequently, anterograde tracing experiments were carried out in order to define more precisely the termination areas of the corticoamygdaloid fibers. The results of the present study indicate that the <BrainRegion>main and accessory olfactory bulbs</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>anterior olfactory nucleus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>prepiriform cortex</BrainRegion> and discrete regions of the <BrainRegion>medial frontal lobe</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>insular and temporal cortices</BrainRegion>, as well as the <BrainRegion>perirhinal and entorhinal cortices</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>ventral subiculum</BrainRegion> project to the <BrainRegion>amygdaloid complex</BrainRegion>. The main termination sites of these projections are the <BrainRegion>central, basolateral, and lateral amygdaloid nuclei</BrainRegion>. <BrainRegion>Neocortical regions</BrainRegion> project to the <BrainRegion>lateral nucleus</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>lateral division of the lateral central nucleus</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>mesocortical regions</BrainRegion> project predominantly to the <BrainRegion>basolateral nucleus</BrainRegion> and a <BrainRegion>medial division of the lateral central nucleus</BrainRegion>. In addition, <BrainRegion>area 35</BrainRegion> distributes fibers to the <BrainRegion>lateral nucleus</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>entorhinal cortex</BrainRegion> projects to the <BrainRegion>cortical nuclei of the amygdaloid complex</BrainRegion>. Fibers from the <BrainRegion>infralimbic area</BrainRegion> only reach the region of the <BrainRegion>medial central nucleus</BrainRegion>. Of the <BrainRegion>allocortical regions</BrainRegion> the <BrainRegion>prepiriform cortex</BrainRegion> distributes its fibers to the <BrainRegion>lateral, basolateral, and cortical nuclei</BrainRegion>, whereas the <BrainRegion>ventral subiculum</BrainRegion> projects to the medial division of the <BrainRegion>lateral central nucleus</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>cortical nuclei</BrainRegion>. In the <BrainRegion>neocortical</BrainRegion> and most of the <BrainRegion>mesocortical regions</BrainRegion> the cells which project to the <BrainRegion>lateral and basolateral amygdaloid nuclei</BrainRegion> lie in layer III, whereas the cells which project to the <BrainRegion>central nucleus</BrainRegion> are located in layer V.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Embryogenesis of the serotonergic system in the earthworm Eisenia fetida (Annelida, Oligochaeta): immunohistochemical and biochemical studies.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Organization of the serotonergic system and changes of the serotonin (5-HT) content were studied during the embryogenesis of the earthworm Eisenia fetida, using immunocytochemistry and HPLC. A gradual emergence of 5-HT immunoreactive (IR) cells and their axon projections in the several ganglia of the central (CNS) and peripheral nervous system are described in the context of a staged time-scale of development. The first 5-HT- immunoreactive(IR) neurons appear in the subesophageal ganglion at an early embryonic stage (E2), followed by neurons in some rostrally located ventral ganglia. In the cerebral ganglion, 5-HT- immunoreactive(IR) cells can be detected only from stage E5. The number of labeled cells in each ganglion of the embryo increases until hatching, when it is still considerably lower than that observed in adults. This shows that the development of the 5-HTergic system is far from complete by the end of embryogenesis. Organization of 5-HT- immunoreactive(IR) innervation of the body wall starts by stages E3 to E4. In the stomatogastric nervous system the first 5-HT- immunoreactive(IR) fibers can be detected by stage E5. By stage E9 5-HT immunopositive neurons can be observed in both the stomatogastric ganglia and the enteric plexus. Both 5-HT levels and the numbers of the labeled cells show a significant increase before hatching, which indicate a functional maturation of the 5-HTergic system. Based on the early appearance of 5-HT, we suppose that it may play a regulatory role in both the gangliogenesis and the maturation of peripheral functions necessary during postembryonic life.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Altered development of <BrainRegion>visual subcortical</BrainRegion> projections following neonatal <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> ablation in the hamster.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Previous research has demonstrated that precise patterns of axonal connectivity often develop during a series of stages characterized by pathfinding, target recognition, and address selection. This last stage involves the focusing of projections to a precisely defined region within the target. Because <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> projections begin to innervate <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion> before the latter stages are reached, these projections may be important in the establishment of adult-like patterns of <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> connectivity. To address this issue, we examined the mature corticopontine and corticospinal projections of <BrainRegion>visual cortex</BrainRegion> deprived of early <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> input by <BrainRegion>visual thalamic</BrainRegion> ablation. Although ablations on the day of birth in hamsters did not disrupt the targeting of appropriate <BrainRegion>subcortical</BrainRegion> structures by <BrainRegion>visual cortical</BrainRegion> axons, they did alter the organization of projections within the <BrainRegion>basilar pons</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>. The density and spread of visual corticopontine connections in lesioned animals was greatly increased relative to unlesioned animals, suggesting that <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> afferents are required during address selection, when the topographic specificity of projections is established. To determine whether early <BrainRegion>visual thalamic</BrainRegion> ablation increases connectivity by stabilizing an exuberant developmental projection, we examined the normal development of visual corticopontine connections in hamsters ages postnatal days 1-17 (P1-P17). From the earliest ages, <BrainRegion>visual cortical</BrainRegion> axons innervate the <BrainRegion>pontine nucleus</BrainRegion> in regions specific to their adult projection zones and show progressive growth within these zones. At no time during development do projections exist that are equivalent to the projections found after <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> ablation, suggesting that removal of <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> input does not simply stabilize a developmental projection.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Sympathetic nerve trajectories to rat <BrainRegion>orbital</BrainRegion> targets: role of connective tissue pathways.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The trajectories of sympathetic nerves projecting to <BrainRegion>orbital</BrainRegion> targets were determined in adult rats with intact innervation and following acute sympathetic denervation, neonatal unilateral superior cervical ganglionectomy, or unilateral ganglionectomy on postnatal day 30. Sympathetic nerves were identified by using immunofluorescence for the noradrenergic transmitter enzyme dopamine beta-hydroxylase and by using catecholamine histofluorescence. In rats with intact innervation, sympathetic fibers travel to the orbit in association with the abducens, trochlear, and Vidian nerves. Within the retroorbital and retroocular connective tissue, the fibers redistribute to become associated with sensory-nerve branches of the <BrainRegion>trigeminal nerve</BrainRegion>, the orbital vasculature, and the <BrainRegion>periorbital</BrainRegion> sheath. Fibers reach their targets by traversing variable amounts of connective tissue of the <BrainRegion>periorbitum</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>orbital septa</BrainRegion>, and the striated muscle epimysia. Following neonatal ganglionectomy, intracranial fibers of contralateral origin enter the <BrainRegion>orbit</BrainRegion> by traveling through connective tissue of the <BrainRegion>optic nerve meninges</BrainRegion> and lining the anterior lacerated <BrainRegion>foramen</BrainRegion>. These fibers travel independent of the <BrainRegion>trochlear, abducens, and Vidian nerves</BrainRegion>, but, otherwise, they use the same <BrainRegion>orbital</BrainRegion> pathways as those employed in the intact animal. In animals ganglionectomized on postnatal day 30, fibers enter the posterior portion of the <BrainRegion>orbit</BrainRegion> primarily via the <BrainRegion>optic foramen</BrainRegion>; they travel only short distances and end blindly in the <BrainRegion>periorbital</BrainRegion> sheath. These findings indicate that fascial structures are a major component of the pathways that guide sympathetic fibers to their appropriate targets both in normal development and during reinnervation following neonatal ganglionectomy. Because <BrainRegion>orbital</BrainRegion> connective tissues are termination sites of abortive fiber sprouting in older rats, developmental changes in the properties of these tissues may contribute to the absence of pathway formation in the mature animal.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Transcription factor GATA-3 alters pathway selection of olivocochlear neurons and affects morphogenesis of the ear.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Patterning the vertebrate ear requires the coordinated expression of genes that are involved in morphogenesis, neurogenesis, and hair cell formation. The zinc finger gene GATA-3 is expressed both in the <BrainRegion>inner ear</BrainRegion> and in afferent and efferent auditory neurons. Specifically, GATA-3 is expressed in a population of neurons in rhombomere 4 that extend their axons across the floor plate of rhombomere 4 (r4) at embryonic day 10 (E10) and reach the sensory epithelia of the ear by E13.5. The distribution of their cell bodies corresponds to that of the cell bodies of the <BrainRegion>cochlear</BrainRegion> and vestibular efferent neurons as revealed by labeling with tracers. Both GATA-3 heterozygous and GATA-3 null mutant mice show unusual axonal projections, such as misrouted crossing fibers and fibers in the facial nerve, that are absent in wild-type littermates. This suggests that GATA-3 is involved in the pathfinding of efferent neuron axons that navigate to the ear. In the ear, GATA-3 is expressed inside the otocyst and the surrounding periotic mesenchyme. The latter expression is in areas of branching of the developing ear leading to the formation of <BrainRegion>semicircular canals</BrainRegion>. Ears of GATA-3 null mutants remain cystic, with a single extension of the endolymphatic duct and no formation of <BrainRegion>semicircular canals</BrainRegion> or <BrainRegion>saccular</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>utricular</BrainRegion> recesses. Thus, both the distribution of GATA-3 and the effects of null mutations on the ear suggest involvement of GATA-3 in morphogenesis of the ear. This study shows for the first time that a zinc finger factor is involved in axonal navigation of the <BrainRegion>inner ear</BrainRegion> efferent neurons and, simultaneously, in the morphogenesis of the <BrainRegion>inner ear</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Anatomical organization of the <BrainRegion>primary visual cortex</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>area 17</BrainRegion>) of the cat. A comparison with <BrainRegion>area 17</BrainRegion> of the macaque monkey.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Golgi and axonal transport techniques have been used to examine the organization of neurons within <BrainRegion>primary visual cortex</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>area 17</BrainRegion>, of the cat. This organization has been compared to that of the primate <BrainRegion>cortical area 17</BrainRegion> as described in previous studies and it is discussed in relationship to the distribution of afferents from the <BrainRegion>dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion> (dLGN). The visual cortex of the cat and monkey show strong similarities in the laminar positions of neurons projecting extrinsically and also in the restriction of spiny stellate neurons to a central lamina (lamina 4) receiving input from the <BrainRegion>dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(dLGN) . However, lamina 4B in the monkey, which contains spiny stellate neurons but does not receive direct input from the <BrainRegion>dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(dLGN) , has no direct counterpart in cat <BrainRegion>area 17</BrainRegion>. Axon projections of spiny stellate neurons in the other divisions of lamina 4 differ in cat and monkey: the small, closely packed neurons in the lowermost division of lamina 4 (4B in the cat, 4Cbeta in the monkey) project chiefly within lamina 4 in the cat whereas in the monkey they have a strong projection to lamina 3. In the cat, spiny stellate neurons of lamina 4A project upon lamina 3 whereas in the monkey those in the apparently equivalent zone, 4Calpha, project upon lamina 4B. Most non-spiny stellate neurons examined have precisely organized interlaminar axonal projections which differ from the axon trajectories of neighboring spiny neurons.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Evidence for centripetally shifting terminals on the <BrainRegion>tectum</BrainRegion> of postmetamorphic Rana pipiens.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>In larval frogs the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>tectum</BrainRegion> grow in topologically dissimilar patterns: new cells are added as peripheral annuli in the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> and as caudal crescents in the <BrainRegion>tectum</BrainRegion>. Retinotopy is maintained by the continual caudalward shifting of the terminals of the <BrainRegion>optic</BrainRegion> axons. After metamorphosis the pattern of growth changes. The <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> continues to add new ganglion cells peripherally, but there is no neurogenesis in the <BrainRegion>tectum</BrainRegion>. To maintain retinotopy in postmetamorphic frogs, the terminals of the <BrainRegion>optic</BrainRegion> axons must continually shift toward the <BrainRegion>central tectum</BrainRegion>. We tested the proposal of centripetally shifting axons by making punctate injections of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) in the <BrainRegion>tectum</BrainRegion> of adult Rana pipiens and observing the patterns of filled cells in the <BrainRegion>contralateral retina</BrainRegion>, as was done in the goldfish (Easter and Stuermer, &apos;84). Punctate applications of horseradish peroxidase(HRP) in the <BrainRegion>tectum</BrainRegion> should be taken up: 1) by fascicles, and label a partial anulus of cells, 2) by terminals, and label a cluster of cells in the corresponding retinotopic site, and 3) by the extrafascicular axonal segments, and label a band of cells connecting the partial annulus to the cluster. If the terminals have shifted centripetally, the band of cells labeled through their extrafascicular segments should have a spoke-like orientation, with the center of the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> as the hub. As the <BrainRegion>tectal</BrainRegion> site moves from rostral to caudal, this band of cells should move, pendulum-like, from temporal to nasal <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>. In general, the patterns of horseradish peroxidase(HRP) -filled <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> cells we observed were consistent with our predictions. In addition, horseradish peroxidase(HRP) taken up by the oldest (rostral) <BrainRegion>tectal</BrainRegion> axons produced more complex patterns of filled cells that indicated that these axons had shifted both caudally before metamorphosis and centripetally after.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Comparison of neural elements in sexually dimorphic segments of the grasshopper, Schistocerca americana.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>A uniquely female behavior in grasshoppers, oviposition, is driven by neural circuitry in the terminal abdominal segments of the female&apos;s central nervous system. Because it is known that the embryonic pattern of neuroblasts is sexually monomorphic in these animals, we were interested to know how the central nervous system of adults is organized to support the obvious behavioral dimorphism. Here, we compare three classes of identifiable adult neurons: ovipositor motor neurons, efferent dorsal unpaired median (DUM) neurons, and dorsal unpaired median(DUM) interneurons in the eighth abdominal neuromere. Cobalt backfills of the eighth tergal nerves revealed identical complements of motor neurons in males and females. Included among these neurons in the male were putative homologues of two sets of ovipositor muscle motor neurons. Whereas these motor neurons supply two ovipositor muscles in the female, they are divided to supply three muscles in males. The eighth abdominal neuromere of both sexes contained seven efferent dorsal unpaired median(DUM) neurons, but peripheral axon projections varied between males and females in accordance with gender-specific targets. In the eighth neuromere of females, some 22 small cell bodies of dorsal unpaired median(DUM) interneurons were stained with Toluidine blue, whereas only three male dorsal unpaired median(DUM) interneurons were found. Male muscle homologues were induced to express a rhythmical motor pattern by experimental methods that activate the oviposition pattern in females. The induced pattern in males is of unknown behavioral significance. Although oviposition normally occurs only after sexual maturity, the motor pattern could be activated at all life stages in females, including embryos, as early as 90% of embryonic development.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Transitory uptake of serotonin in the developing sensory pathways of the common marmoset.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Serotonin (5-HT) affects brain development during sensitive developmental periods. In rodents, transient sites of high affinity capture of 5-HT were demonstrated in the primary sensory neurons and in the sensory thalamocortical afferents. This uptake is required to adjust 5-HT receptor stimulation during the formation of sensory maps. To determine whether similar mechanisms exist in primates, we analyzed staged embryos and postnatal pups in the common marmoset (total gestation time, 142 days). Immunocytochemical analyses were performed using antisera to 5-HT, to the serotonin transporter (SERT), and to the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT2). 5-HT, serotonin transporter(SERT) , and VMAT2 labeled the <BrainRegion>raphe</BrainRegion> neurons and their terminal network from embryonic day (E)70 to adulthood. In addition, from E70-130 VMAT2 and serotonin transporter(SERT) were observed in all the sensory <BrainRegion>cranial nerves</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>olfactory nerve</BrainRegion>, the gustatory, the trigeminal, the auditory fibers, in the <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> ganglion cells, and the optic tract up to the <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion>. All the spinal sensory ganglia and their peripheral sensory branches were labeled. Accumulation of 5-HT was observed in all the sensory neurons expressing serotonin transporter(SERT) and the corresponding axon tracts. Since these neurons were missing tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH), the synthesizing enzyme for 5-HT, they most likely accumulated 5-HT through the action of the amine transporters, as has been shown in rodents. No transient expression of 5-HT markers was detectable in the sensory thalamocortical axons at any of the ages examined. Thus, the existence of 5-HT uptake in nonserotoninergic neurons appears to be a conserved feature in primates, although the topographic extent of this transient expression is more restricted than that previously demonstrated in rodents.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Morphological analysis of external urethral and external anal sphincter motoneurones of cat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>A previous electrophysiological study suggested that there is a common correlation among axonal conduction velocity, input resistance, and size of motoneurones regardless of the muscle type innervated by a motoneurone and that the dendritic arborization is less developed in sphincter than in hindlimb motoneurones. To verify the previous suggestions, cell bodies, axons, and dendrites of external urethral sphincter (EUS) and external anal sphincter (EAS) motoneurones were studied after intracellular labelling with horseradish peroxidase in cats anaesthetised with pentobarbitone. All the cell bodies were located in <BrainRegion>Onuf&apos;s nucleus</BrainRegion>. The soma diameter (19.7-50.0 microns) was positively correlated with the axonal conduction velocity, and the plots of these two variables were extrapolations from similar plots obtained for hindlimb alpha-motoneurones, supporting the suggestion of the preceding report. Half of motoneurones had recurrent axon collaterals, which terminated within <BrainRegion>Onuf&apos;s nucleus</BrainRegion> and the ventral border of lamina VIII. The diameter of the cell body with collaterals was significantly larger than that without collaterals. Dendrites extended in five directions: dorsal, medial, lateral, rostral, and caudal. Dorsally directed dendrites of both external urethral sphincter(EUS) and external anal sphincter(EAS) motoneurones coursed in lamina VII toward the <BrainRegion>intermediolateral nucleus</BrainRegion>, and dendrites of external anal sphincter(EAS) motoneurones further extended toward the <BrainRegion>intermediomedial nucleus</BrainRegion>. Long dendrites directed rostrally or caudally within <BrainRegion>Onuf&apos;s nucleus</BrainRegion>, more prominently in external urethral sphincter(EUS) motoneurones. external anal sphincter(EAS) motoneurones had longer end branches and relatively larger number of end branches and summed length and surface area of a dendrite compared with external urethral sphincter(EUS) . Among relations, the dendritic surface area and the dendritic volume were tightly correlated with the diameter of the first-order dendrite. The latter relation was almost identical between external urethral sphincter(EUS) , external anal sphincter(EAS) , and hindlimb alpha- and gamma-motoneurones. The large values for the dendritic-to-soma surface area ratio (31 in external urethral sphincter(EUS) , 50 in external anal sphincter(EAS) ) indicated the well-developed dendritic arborization comparable to hindlimb motoneurones. The ratio of sum sigma (daughter diameter)3/2 to the 3/2 power of the parent diameter was 0.99 in external urethral sphincter(EUS) and 1.08 in external anal sphincter(EAS) motoneurones, indicating that the 3/2 power constraint at branching points is well satisfied, and Rall&apos;s equivalent-cylinder model is applicable to sphincter motoneurones.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Lateral geniculate</BrainRegion> projections to the superficial layers of <BrainRegion>visual cortex</BrainRegion> in the tree shrew.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Our recent studies of tree shrew <BrainRegion>striate cortex</BrainRegion> have focused on the organization of <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate</BrainRegion> projections to layer IV and the projections from IV to layer III. Although these pathways play an important role in determining the response properties of layer III neurons, there are additional pathways from the <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion> (LGN) that terminate directly in layer III. Previous studies provided evidence that these projections originate from layers 6 and 3 of the <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(LGN) and terminate in different subdivisions of layer III. In this study we used injections of biocytin to examine the projections of layers 6 and 3 to the <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion> in more detail. Consistent with earlier work, we found that <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(LGN) layer 6 projects heavily to lower IIIc, while <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(LGN) layer 3 terminates densely in layer IIIb and sparsely throughout layers IIIa-I. In addition, we found that neurons in layers 6 and 3 have collateral projections: neurons in <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(LGN) layer 6 project to the bottom of layer IVb and sparsely to I-IIIb; neurons in <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(LGN) layer 3 project sparsely to layers V and VI and to the middle of IV. These patterns of projections are significant in the light of our studies of the connections from <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> layer IV to layer III. <BrainRegion>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion>(LGN) projections to the superficial layers are organized into parallel pathways that exert selective influence over different populations of neurons in layers I-III and on the layer IV neurons that supply them.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Trauma-induced Golgi-like staining of neurons: a new approach to neuronal organization and response to injury.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>A new esterification-silver approach to the directed staining of the dendritic trees of traumatized neurons is described. Stained neurons compare favorably to those labeled with silver chromate Golgi impregnations in the visualization of dendritic arbors. Cells in all parts of the brain, including the <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>cerebral cortex</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>cerebellum</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>striatum</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>, can be detected after focal trauma to that region. Selection of neurons to be stained is made by increasing their affinity for silver with many different types of directed neuronal trauma, including micropipette wounds, pressure, surgical incision, chemical cytotoxicity, and impact trauma. Trauma to one area of the brain results in dendritic arbors staining only in the injured area; other areas of the brain are free of dendritic staining. Injury can be produced either in vivo or in vitro. In vitro injury to neurons allows a high degree of localization and facilitates the analysis of neuronal response to trauma in the absence of complicating factors such as blood flow and secondary injury. The selective affinity for silver staining in this approach is increased very rapidly, allowing detection of traumatized cells fixed minutes after injury. Brains of all mammals used appear to stain similarly, including the rat, mouse, pig, and human. Axons, although labeled less frequently than dendritic arbors, are induced to stain just as rapidly as dendrites. The ability to visualize a large part of the dendritic tree after trauma allows the segregation of neuronal subtypes on the basis of their differential response to injury. Subpopulations of cells in the same area of the brain appear to respond differently to trauma. Differential response of neurons to trauma can easily be detected. For instance, slight variations in trauma can be used to label selectively the major subpopulations of neurons in the <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion>, including pyramidal cells, interneurons near the pyramidal cell layer, or granule cells. Similarly, neurons of the <BrainRegion>hypothalamic paraventricular</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>arcuate nuclei</BrainRegion> respond to compression trauma much more dramatically than other cell types in the same region of the <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion>. <BrainRegion>Hypothalamic</BrainRegion> neurons were studied extensively, particularly in regions that are difficult to routinely stain with Golgi impregnations, including the <BrainRegion>arcuate, paraventricular, supraoptic, and suprachiasmatic nuclei</BrainRegion>. Trauma to these areas was made in vitro after removal of the brain from the skull, allowing easy access to the ventral surface of the brain.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Expression pattern of integrin beta 1 subunit in Purkinje cells of rat and <BrainRegion>cerebellar</BrainRegion> mutant mice.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>We found that integrin beta 1 subunit (INT beta 1)-immunoreactive Purkinje cells first appeared caudally at postnatal day (PD) 6 of rat and most Purkinje cells gradually became positive by postnatal day(PD) 12. The expression of INT beta 1 was then suppressed in some of these cells, so that the positive Purkinje cells in the adult were organized into parasagittal bands interposed by negative cells throughout the vermis and hemispheres. When Purkinje cells were deprived of their climbing fiber innervation by <BrainRegion>inferior cerebellar</BrainRegion> pedunculotomy or by transplantation of <BrainRegion>cerebellar</BrainRegion> anlagen into the anterior eye chamber, the subsequent patterning of INT beta 1-positive Purkinje cells was not changed. In both reeler and weaver mice, the INT beta 1-positive parasagittal bands were observed, however, the Purkinje cells in the staggerer mice did not express INT beta 1 at any stage. These data suggest that the expression of INT beta 1 in Purkinje cells is genetically programmed in the developing <BrainRegion>cerebellum</BrainRegion>, and that the afferent synaptic inputs by climbing and parallel fibers are not prerequisites for INT beta 1 expression in Purkinje cells. Therefore, the unique distribution patterns of INT beta 1-positive Purkinje cells provides a new marker for postnatal development of rodent <BrainRegion>cerebella</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Distinct neurochemical populations in the rat <BrainRegion>central nucleus of the amygdala</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>bed nucleus of the stria terminalis</BrainRegion>: evidence for their selective activation by interleukin-1beta.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The <BrainRegion>lateral division of the central nucleus of the amygdala</BrainRegion> (CEAl) and the <BrainRegion>oval nucleus of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis</BrainRegion> (BSTov) have been linked closely anatomically and functionally. To determine whether these regions may be subdivided further on a neurochemical basis, dual in situ hybridization was used to determine the colocalization of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), enkephalin (ENK), or neurotensin (NT) with glutamic acid decarboxylase isoforms 65 and 67 [used concurrently as a marker for gamma-aminobutyric acid GABA] in these nuclei. It was found that, for both regions, each peptide invariably was localized in a GABAergic cell. Although there was a similar overlap in the distribution of neurotensin(NT) with enkephalin(ENK) in the <BrainRegion>BSTov</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>central nucleus of the amygdala</BrainRegion>(CEAl) , it was observed that corticotropin-releasing hormone(CRH) and enkephalin(ENK) rarely were colocalized in either nucleus. To determine whether these distinct neuronal populations could be activated differentially, male rats were given a systemic injection of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta; 5 microg/kg, i.p.), a stimulus that results in a robust increase in c-fos mRNA expression in the <BrainRegion>BSTov</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>central nucleus of the amygdala</BrainRegion>(CEAl) . The neurochemical identity of these activated neurons showed striking similarities between the <BrainRegion>BSTov</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>central nucleus of the amygdala</BrainRegion>(CEAl) ; All interleukin-1beta(IL-1beta) -responsive cells were GABAergic, the majority of c-fos- positive cells expressed enkephalin(ENK) mRNA (<BrainRegion>BSTov</BrainRegion>, 81%; <BrainRegion>central nucleus of the amygdala</BrainRegion>(CEAl) , 94%), and some expressed neurotensin(NT) mRNA (<BrainRegion>BSTov</BrainRegion>, 23%; <BrainRegion>central nucleus of the amygdala</BrainRegion>(CEAl) , 22%), whereas very few expressed corticotropin-releasing hormone(CRH) mRNA (<BrainRegion>BSTov</BrainRegion>, 4%; <BrainRegion>central nucleus of the amygdala</BrainRegion>(CEAl) , 1%). These data provide evidence for the existence of discrete neural circuits within the <BrainRegion>BSTov</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>central nucleus of the amygdala</BrainRegion>(CEAl) , and the similarities in the patterns of neurochemical colocalization in these nuclei are consistent with the concept of an extended <BrainRegion>amygdala</BrainRegion>. Furthermore, these data indicate that intraperitoneal interleukin-1beta(IL-1beta) recruits neurochemically distinct pathways within the <BrainRegion>BSTov</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>central nucleus of the amygdala</BrainRegion>(CEAl) , and it is suggested that this differential activation may mediate specific aspects of immune, limbic, and/or autonomic processes.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Fiber connections of the <BrainRegion>corpus glomerulosum</BrainRegion> in a teleost, Navodon modestus.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Fiber connections of the <BrainRegion>corpus glomerulosum</BrainRegion> (CG) in a teleost, Navodon modestus, were studied by means of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and the Fink-Heimer methods. The <BrainRegion>corpus glomerulosum</BrainRegion>(CG) is divided into a <BrainRegion>pars anterior</BrainRegion> (GA) and a <BrainRegion>pars rotunda</BrainRegion> (GR). Both the <BrainRegion>GR</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>GA</BrainRegion> have the same cell components and glomeruli. The <BrainRegion>GR</BrainRegion> is composed of four layers arranged concentrically around a central fiber net in the following order (Ito and Kishida, &apos;75): a glomerular layer, a fibrous layer, a small-cell layer, and a peripheral fibrous capsule including large cells. The <BrainRegion>GA</BrainRegion> consists of a central glomerular layer and a peripheral small-cell layer which contains some large cells. Following horseradish peroxidase(HRP) injections into the <BrainRegion>GR</BrainRegion>, horseradish peroxidase(HRP) -positive cells were found bilaterally in the <BrainRegion>nucleus corticalis</BrainRegion> and ipsilaterally in the <BrainRegion>nucleus intermedius of Bricker</BrainRegion> (&apos;29). Lesions of the <BrainRegion>nucleus corticalis</BrainRegion> produced degenerating terminals bilaterally in glomeruli in the <BrainRegion>corpus glomerulosum</BrainRegion>(CG) . The course of the fiber connections was coincident with that of the commissura horizontalis. Lesions of the <BrainRegion>nucleus intermedius</BrainRegion> resulted in degenerating terminals in the fibrous layer of the <BrainRegion>GR</BrainRegion> and the small-cell layer of the <BrainRegion>GA</BrainRegion>. Following the destruction of the <BrainRegion>GR</BrainRegion>, degenerating terminals occurred in the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral lobus inferior</BrainRegion>. Both small and large cells in the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral corpus glomerulosum</BrainRegion>(CG) were labeled after horseradish peroxidase(HRP) injections into the <BrainRegion>lobus inferior</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Low density of membrane particles in auditory hair cells of lizards and birds suggests an absence of somatic motility.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Hair cells are the mechanoreceptive cells of the vertebrate lateral line and inner ear. In addition to their sensory function, hair cells display motility and thus themselves generate mechanical energy, which is thought to enhance sensitivity. Two principal cellular mechanism are known that can mediate hair-cell motility in vitro. One of these is based on voltage-dependent changes of an intramembrane protein and has so far been demonstrated only in outer hair cells of the mammalian <BrainRegion>cochlea</BrainRegion>. Correlated with this, the cell membranes of outer hair cells carry an extreme density of embedded particles, as revealed by freeze fracturing. The present study explored the possibility of membrane-based motility in hair cells of nonmammals, by determining their density of intramembrane particles. Replicas of freeze-fractured membrane were prepared from auditory hair cells of a lizard, the Tokay gecko, and a bird, the barn owl. These species were chosen because of independent evidence for active <BrainRegion>cochlear</BrainRegion> mechanics, in the form of spontaneous otoacoustic emissions. For quantitative comparison, mammalian inner and outer hair cells, as well as vestibular hair, cells were reevaluated. Lizard and bird hair cells displayed median densities of 2,360 and 1,880 intramembrane particles/microm2, respectively. This was not significantly different from the densities in vestibular and mammalian inner hair cells; however, it was about half the density in of mammalian outer hair cells. This suggests that nonmammalian hair cells do not possess high densities of motor protein in their membranes and are thus unlikely to be capable of somatic motility.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Alpha- and gamma-motoneurons in the adult human <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>somatic cranial nerve nuclei</BrainRegion>: the significance of dendroachitectonics studied by the Golgi method.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>A modified Golgi method (Vaisamruat and Hess, &apos;53) was found to give satisfactory impregnation of cell bodies and dendrites, but not of dendritic spines and axons, in adult human material fixed by immersion in formalin. Examination of the motor columns in the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> intumescences and of the third and twelfth <BrainRegion>cranial nerve nuclei</BrainRegion> revealed four neuron types, based on dendritic field size and dendritic branching pattern. Two of these were recognized as alpha-motoneurons; one of them was seen only in the <BrainRegion>medial motor column</BrainRegion> of the <BrainRegion>spinal ventral horn</BrainRegion>, while the other was observed in the <BrainRegion>cranial motor nuclei</BrainRegion> as well as the <BrainRegion>spinal lateral motor column</BrainRegion>. Differences in somadendritic dimensions in this neuron type were thought to reflect motor unit size, and thus terminal axon field dimensions. Of the two types of gamma-motoneurons recognized in the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>oculomotor nucleus</BrainRegion>, one was a miniature version of the commoner type of alpha-motoneuron. On this basis, it is proposed that it may give rise to fusimotor axons with plate endings. The second type of gamma-motoneuron does not resemble any of the other motoneuron types, and its axons may therefore be thought to terminate in trail endings.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Species differences in <BrainRegion>hippocampal commissural</BrainRegion> connections: studies in rat, guinea pig, rabbit, and cat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The tritiated amino acid autoradiographic method was employed to characterize the patterns of commissural projections originating in the <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion> of the rat, guinea pig, rabbit, and cat. The results demonstrate that significant differences between species are present despite the overall similarity of the projections. In the rat and cat the commissural connections are widely distributed along the septotemporal axis of the <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion>, but in the guinea pig and rabbit they are less widely distributed along this axis. Second, within the <BrainRegion>hippocampus proper</BrainRegion> the radial distribution of the commissural projection is species specific. In the rat, <BrainRegion>CA3 commissural</BrainRegion> projections are present in both the <BrainRegion>strata oriens</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>radiatum</BrainRegion>, but the densest projection is to the <BrainRegion>stratum oriens</BrainRegion>. In the guinea pig the radial distribution of this projection is similar to that observed in the rat, but in the rabbit the projection is almost entirely confined to the <BrainRegion>stratum oriens</BrainRegion>. In contrast, in the cat the <BrainRegion>CA3 commissural</BrainRegion> projection is very dense to the <BrainRegion>stratum radiatum</BrainRegion> and sparse to <BrainRegion>stratum oriens</BrainRegion>. An analysis of the relative density of label in the molecular layer of the <BrainRegion>fascia dentata</BrainRegion> suggests that the density of the commissural projection from <BrainRegion>CA4</BrainRegion> is much greater in the rat and cat than in the guinea pig or rabbit. These results indicate that care must be exercised in the generalization of connectional data between species. The results also suggest a possible explanation for differences observed in the electrophysiology of these connections between species.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Cortical</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>subcortical</BrainRegion> projections of the <BrainRegion>middle temporal area</BrainRegion> (MT) and adjacent <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion> in galagos.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Projections of the <BrainRegion>middle temporal visual area</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>MT</BrainRegion>, and of <BrainRegion>visual cortex</BrainRegion> adjoining MT were investigated with autoradiographic methods in the prosimian primate, Galago senegalensis. <BrainRegion>Ipsilateral cortical</BrainRegion> targets of <BrainRegion>MT</BrainRegion> included <BrainRegion>area 17</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>area 18</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>cortex caudal to MT</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>cortex ventral to MT</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>parietal-occipital cortex dorsal to MT</BrainRegion>. This pattern of projections suggests that <BrainRegion>extrastriate cortex</BrainRegion> contains a number of visual subdivisions in addition to <BrainRegion>MT</BrainRegion>. Contralateral projections were to <BrainRegion>MT</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>parietal-occipital cortex</BrainRegion>. Projections from <BrainRegion>MT</BrainRegion> to <BrainRegion>areas 17</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>18</BrainRegion> connected regions representing similar parts of the visual hemifield while the location of <BrainRegion>callosal</BrainRegion> projections in <BrainRegion>MT</BrainRegion> matched the location of the injection site in the other hemisphere. Label in <BrainRegion>area 17</BrainRegion> was concentrated in layers I, III, and VI whereas other <BrainRegion>cortical areas</BrainRegion> were most densely labeled in the granular and supragranular layers. <BrainRegion>Subcortical</BrainRegion> projections of <BrainRegion>MT</BrainRegion> included the <BrainRegion>reticular nucleus of the thalamus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>lateral posterior nucleus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>superior pulvinar</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>inferior pulvinar</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>pontine nuclei</BrainRegion>. The projection pattern to the <BrainRegion>superior and inferior pulvinar nuclei</BrainRegion> suggests that <BrainRegion>MT</BrainRegion> projects in a topographic manner to two subdivisions within each of these structures. Injections in <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion> just outside of <BrainRegion>MT</BrainRegion> labeled <BrainRegion>area 18</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>inferotemporal cortex</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>parietal-occipital cortex</BrainRegion>, and, to a lesser extent, <BrainRegion>MT</BrainRegion>. The projections to <BrainRegion>inferotemporal cortex</BrainRegion> clearly distinguish the bordering cortex from <BrainRegion>MT</BrainRegion>. <BrainRegion>Contralateral cortical</BrainRegion> terminations were in locations corresponding to the injection site. <BrainRegion>Subcortical</BrainRegion> targets were generally similar to those seen after <BrainRegion>MT</BrainRegion> injections, although additional projections were observed depending on the location of the injection. Comparison of these results from the prosimian galago with studies in New and Old World monkeys indicates there are substantial similarities in projections. Thus, some of the <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> subdivisions described for monkeys appear to exist in prosimians.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Interhemispheric neocortical</BrainRegion> connections of the <BrainRegion>corpus callosum</BrainRegion> in the normal mouse: a study based on anterograde and retrograde methods.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText><BrainRegion>Interhemispheric neocortical</BrainRegion> connections are widely distributed through the <BrainRegion>corpus callosum</BrainRegion> in the mouse. <BrainRegion>Callosal</BrainRegion> connections are present in all cytoarchitectonic fields except field 25. The distal extemity representations of SmI, and MsI the representation of the mystacial vibrissae in SmI, and the more peripheral field representation of <BrainRegion>VI</BrainRegion> are relatively acallosal. Dense projections lie in the midline or truncal representations of SmI, MsI, SmII, at the vertical meridian representations bordering field 17, and medial to the <BrainRegion>AI</BrainRegion> representation. The radial distribution of terminals is bimodal in most cytoarchitectonic fields. It is unimodal in the supracallosal segment of field 29b and fields 49 and 27, trimodal in fields 13 and 35. The cells of origin of <BrainRegion>callosal</BrainRegion> fibers appear to have the same topographic pattern of distribution as the <BrainRegion>callosal</BrainRegion> terminals, observing the same steep and gradual density gradients. No cells giving rise to callosal axons are identified in the acallosal regions of fields 2 and 17. Further, superficial focal lesions in <BrainRegion>cortical areas</BrainRegion> which receive <BrainRegion>callosal</BrainRegion> connections give rise only to homotopic contralateral degeneration. <BrainRegion>Acallosal areas of 17 and 2</BrainRegion> give rise to no <BrainRegion>callosal</BrainRegion> connections. The cells of origin of <BrainRegion>callosal</BrainRegion> connections are located at all laminar levels of the <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion> and include pyramidal and polymorphic cells but not the granule cells of layer IV.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Light and electron microscopic immunocytochemical localization of AMPA-selective glutamate receptors in the rat <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>alpha-Amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA)-type glutamate receptors are probably the most widespread excitatory neurotransmitter receptors of the central nervous system, and they play a role in most normal and pathological neural activities. However, previous detailed studies of AMPA subunit distribution have been limited mainly to the brain. Thus, a comprehensive study of AMPA receptor subunit distribution was carried out on sections of rat <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> and dorsal root ganglia, which were immunolabeled with antibodies made against peptides corresponding to C-terminal portions of the AMPA receptor subunits: GluR1, GluR2/3, and GluR4. In the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>, labeling was most prominent in the <BrainRegion>superficial dorsal horn</BrainRegion>, motoneurons, and nuclei containing preganglionic autonomic neurons. Immunostaining also was observed in neurons in other regions including those known to contain Renshaw cells and Ia inhibitory cells. Although overall immunostaining was lighter with antibody to GluR1 than with GluR2/3 and 4, there were neurons that preferentially stained with antibody to GluR1. These &quot;GluR1 intense" neurons were usually fusiform and most concentrated in lamina X. In dorsal root ganglia, immunostaining of ganglion cell bodies was moderate to dense with antibody to GluR2/3 and light to moderate with antibody to GluR4. Possible neuroglia in the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> (mainly GluR2/3 and 4) and satellite cells in dorsal root ganglia (GluR4) were immunostained. Electron microscopic studies of the <BrainRegion>superficial dorsal horn</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>lateral motor column</BrainRegion> showed staining that was restricted mainly to postsynaptic densities and associated dendritic and cell body cytoplasm. In <BrainRegion>dorsal horn</BrainRegion>, colocalization of dense-cored vesicles with clear, round synaptic vesicles was observed in unstained presynaptic terminals apposed to stained postsynaptic densities. Subsynaptic dense bodies (Taxi-bodies) were associated with some stained postsynaptic densities in both the <BrainRegion>superficial dorsal horn</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>lateral motor column</BrainRegion>. Based on several morphological features including vesicle structure and presence of Taxi-bodies, it is likely that at least some of the postsynaptic staining seen in this study is apposed to glutamatergic input from primary sensory afferent terminals.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>CART peptide-immunoreactive neurones in the <BrainRegion>nucleus accumbens</BrainRegion> in monkeys: ultrastructural analysis, colocalization studies, and synaptic interactions with dopaminergic afferents.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) is a novel mRNA whose level of expression was found to be increased in the <BrainRegion>striatum</BrainRegion> after acute administration of psychomotor stimulants in rats. To define better the potential role of Cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript(CART) peptides in behavioural and physiologic changes induced by psychomotor stimulants, we analyzed the distribution, ultrastructural features, synaptic connectivity, and transmitter content of Cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript(CART) peptide-immunoreactive neurones in the <BrainRegion>nucleus accumbens</BrainRegion> in monkeys. Medium-sized Cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript(CART) peptide-immunoreactive neurones within a rich plexus of labelled varicosities were found mostly in the medial division of the shell of the <BrainRegion>nucleus accumbens</BrainRegion> in monkeys. At the electron microscope level, Cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript(CART) peptide immunoreactivity was exclusively associated with neuronal structures that included perikarya, dendrites, spines as well as nerve terminals packed with electron-lucent and dense-core vesicles. Most Cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript(CART) peptide-containing somata displayed the ultrastructural features of <BrainRegion>striatal</BrainRegion> output neurones. The majority of labelled terminals formed symmetric axodendritic synapses and displayed gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) immunoreactivity. Cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript(CART) peptide-immunoreactive somata were not immunoreactive for parvalbumin and somatostatin, two markers of <BrainRegion>striatal</BrainRegion> interneurones, nor for calbindin D-28k, a marker of a subpopulation of projection neurones. In double-immunostained sections, Cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript(CART) peptide-immunoreactive dendrites were found to be contacted by tyrosine hydroxylase-positive terminals which displayed the ultrastructural features of dopamine-containing boutons. These findings strongly suggest that Cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript(CART) peptides may be a cotransmitter with gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) in a subpopulation of projection neurones in the monkey <BrainRegion>accumbens</BrainRegion>. Furthermore, the fact that Cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript(CART) peptide-immunoreactive neurones receive direct synaptic inputs from dopaminergic afferents and are particularly abundant in the caudomedial division of the shell of the <BrainRegion>nucleus accumbens</BrainRegion> suggest that Cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript(CART) peptides might be involved in neuronal and behavioural changes that underlie addiction to psychomotor stimulants and feeding in primates.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Ontogenesis of neurons producing luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) in the <BrainRegion>nervus terminalis</BrainRegion> of the rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Immunoreactive luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) was first detected at 15 days of gestation in ganglion cells associated with the peripheral, intracranial, and central parts of the <BrainRegion>nervus terminalis</BrainRegion> of the rat. luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone(LHRH) was not detected in any other structure of the central nervous system at this age. In the 17-day-old fetal rat, 62% of the total luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone(LHRH) -reactive neuronal population was found in ganglion cells of the <BrainRegion>nervus terminalis</BrainRegion>. At this same age, immunoreactive beta-luteinizing hormone (beta-LH) was first seen in gonadotropes of the <BrainRegion>anterior pituitary</BrainRegion> gland. At 19 days of gestation, 31% of the total number of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone(LHRH) -reactive neurons observed in the rat brain was found in the <BrainRegion>nervus terminalis</BrainRegion>, and immunoreactive processes were first seen in the <BrainRegion>organum vasculosum</BrainRegion> of the <BrainRegion>lamina terminalis</BrainRegion> and in the <BrainRegion>median eminence</BrainRegion>. Our data indicate that from 15 to 19 days of gestation the <BrainRegion>nervus terminalis</BrainRegion> is a principal source of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone(LHRH) in the fetal rat. Presence of the decapeptide in the <BrainRegion>nervus terminalis</BrainRegion> prior to appearance of beta-luteinizing hormone(beta-LH) in the <BrainRegion>anterior pituitary</BrainRegion> suggests a possible role for luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone(LHRH) in this system on maturation of the gonadotropes and differentiation of the brain-pituitary-gonadal axis.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Efferent connections from the <BrainRegion>lateral hypothalamic region</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>lateral preoptic area</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus</BrainRegion> of the rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The <BrainRegion>lateral preoptic and lateral hypothalamic regions</BrainRegion> contain the majority of the cell groups embedded in the fibre trajectories of the <BrainRegion>medial forebrain</BrainRegion> bundle on its course through the <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion>. Recent studies have extended considerably the parcellation of the <BrainRegion>lateral hypothalamic region</BrainRegion>, and therefore, the need to emphasize new insights into the anatomical organisation of projections from the neurons of the <BrainRegion>lateral hypothalamic region</BrainRegion>. In the present study we describe the anatomical organisation of efferent projections from the <BrainRegion>lateral preoptic</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>lateral hypothalamic regions</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus</BrainRegion> (PVN) on the basis of retrograde- and anterograde-tracing techniques. Iontophoretic injections of the retrograde tracer, cholera toxin subunit B, into the <BrainRegion>paraventricular nucleus</BrainRegion>(PVN) revealed that most <BrainRegion>hypothalamic nuclei</BrainRegion> project to the <BrainRegion>paraventricular nucleus</BrainRegion>(PVN) . Within the <BrainRegion>lateral hypothalamic region</BrainRegion>, retrogradely labelled cells were concentrated in the <BrainRegion>intermediate hypothalamic area</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>lateral hypothalamic area</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>perifornical nucleus</BrainRegion>, whereas fewer retrogradely labelled cells were found in the <BrainRegion>lateral preoptic area</BrainRegion>. To determine the distribution of terminating fibres in <BrainRegion>subnuclei of the heterogeneous paraventricular nucleus</BrainRegion>(PVN) , iontophoretic injections of the anterograde tracer Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin were delivered into distinct areas of the <BrainRegion>lateral hypothalamic region</BrainRegion>. Neurons of the <BrainRegion>intermediate hypothalamic area</BrainRegion> projected mainly to the <BrainRegion>paraventricular nucleus(PVN) subnuclei</BrainRegion>, which contained parvicellular neuroendocrine cells. In contrast, neurons of the rostral and tuberal parts of the <BrainRegion>lateral hypothalamic area</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>perifornical nucleus</BrainRegion> projected to the <BrainRegion>paraventricular nucleus(PVN) subnuclei</BrainRegion>, which contained parvicellular neurons that send descending projections to preganglionic cell groups in the <BrainRegion>medulla</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>perifornical nucleus</BrainRegion> was the only area within the <BrainRegion>lateral hypothalamic region</BrainRegion> that consistently innervated magnocellular perikarya of the <BrainRegion>paraventricular nucleus</BrainRegion>(PVN) . Finally, all areas of the <BrainRegion>lateral hypothalamic region</BrainRegion> contributed substantially to fibres terminating in the perinuclear shell of the <BrainRegion>paraventricular nucleus</BrainRegion>(PVN) . These results demonstrate that anatomically distinct areas of the <BrainRegion>lateral hypothalamic region</BrainRegion> have distinct projections to <BrainRegion>subnuclei of the paraventricular nucleus</BrainRegion>(PVN) and further substantiate the view that the <BrainRegion>lateral hypothalamic region</BrainRegion> as well as the <BrainRegion>paraventricular nucleus</BrainRegion>(PVN) constitute anatomically and functionally heterogeneous structures.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Efferent projections of the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion> to <BrainRegion>peri-locus coeruleus</BrainRegion> dendrites in rat brain: evidence for a monosynaptic pathway.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText><BrainRegion>Locus coeruleus</BrainRegion> (LC) neurons respond to autonomic influences, are activated by physiological stressors, and discharge in parallel with peripheral sympathetic nerves. The circuitry underlying modulation of <BrainRegion>Locus coeruleus</BrainRegion>(LC) activity by physiological manipulations (i.e., hemodynamic stress, hypovolumia) remains unclear. Specifically, monosynaptic projections from primary baroreceptor centers to the <BrainRegion>Locus coeruleus</BrainRegion>(LC) have been suggested by electrophysiological studies but have not been unequivocally established. Light microscopic anterograde tract-tracing studies have previously shown that neurons originating in the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion> (NTS) project to a region of the <BrainRegion>rostrodorsal pontine tegmentum</BrainRegion>, which contains noradrenergic dendrites of the <BrainRegion>Locus coeruleus</BrainRegion>(LC) ; however, it is not known whether these <BrainRegion>nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion>(NTS) efferents specifically target <BrainRegion>Locus coeruleus</BrainRegion>(LC) dendrites. Therefore, we combined peroxidase labeling of biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) or Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) from the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion>(NTS) with gold-silver labeling for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in the <BrainRegion>rostrolateral peri- Locus coeruleus(LC) region</BrainRegion>. Injections placed into neighboring nuclei (<BrainRegion>nucleus gracilis</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>hypoglossal nucleus</BrainRegion>) served as controls. Only injections centered in the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion>(NTS) produced anterograde labeling in <BrainRegion>peri- Locus coeruleus(LC) regions</BrainRegion> containing tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) processes. By electron microscopy, biotinylated dextran amine(BDA) - or Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin(PHA-L) -labeled axon terminals originating from the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion>(NTS) contained small, clear, and some large dense-core vesicles and formed heterogeneous synaptic contacts characteristic of both excitatory- and inhibitory-type transmitters. Approximately 19% of the biotinylated dextran amine(BDA) and Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin(PHA-L) axon terminals examined originating from the commissural portion of the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion>(NTS) formed synaptic specializations with dendrites exhibiting tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) immunoreactivity in the <BrainRegion>peri- Locus coeruleus</BrainRegion>(LC) . These results demonstrate that neurons projecting from the cardiovascular-related portion of the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion>(NTS) target noradrenergic dendrites, indicating that barosensitive <BrainRegion>nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion>(NTS) neurons may directly modulate the activity of <BrainRegion>Locus coeruleus</BrainRegion>(LC) neurons and may serve to integrate autonomic responses in brain by influencing the widespread noradrenergic projections of the <BrainRegion>Locus coeruleus</BrainRegion>(LC) . In addition, these findings demonstrate that extranuclear dendrites are an important termination site for afferents to the <BrainRegion>Locus coeruleus</BrainRegion>(LC) .</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Alterations in calretinin immunostaining in the ferret <BrainRegion>superior olivary complex</BrainRegion> after <BrainRegion>cochlear</BrainRegion> ablation.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>In this study, we used image analysis to assess changes in calretinin immunoreactivity in the <BrainRegion>lateral (LSO) and medial (MSO) superior olivary nuclei</BrainRegion> in ferrets 2 months after unilateral <BrainRegion>cochlear</BrainRegion> ablations at 30-40 days of age, soon after hearing onset. These two nuclei are the first significant sites of binaural convergence in the ascending auditory system, and both receive direct projections from the <BrainRegion>deafferented cochlear nucleus</BrainRegion>. <BrainRegion>Cochlear</BrainRegion> ablation results in a decrease in the overall level of calretinin immunostaining within the <BrainRegion>LSO</BrainRegion> ipsilaterally compared with the contralateral side and with control animals and within the <BrainRegion>MSO</BrainRegion> bilaterally compared with control ferrets. In addition, the level of calretinin immunostaining ipsilaterally within neurons in the <BrainRegion>LSO</BrainRegion> was significantly less in <BrainRegion>cochlear</BrainRegion> ablated than control animals. In contrast, there was no effect of <BrainRegion>cochlear</BrainRegion> ablation on the level of calretinin immunostaining within neurons either in the <BrainRegion>contralateral LSO</BrainRegion> or in the <BrainRegion>MSO</BrainRegion>. These results are consistent with a downregulation in calretinin within the neuropil of <BrainRegion>MSO</BrainRegion> bilaterally and <BrainRegion>LSO</BrainRegion> ipsilaterally, as well as a downregulation in calretinin within somata in the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral LSO</BrainRegion> as a result of <BrainRegion>unilateral cochlear</BrainRegion> ablation soon after hearing onset. Thus, <BrainRegion>cochlear</BrainRegion>-driven activity appears to affect calcium binding protein levels in both neuropil and neurons within the <BrainRegion>superior olivary complex</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Synaptogenesis in the <BrainRegion>ventromedial hypothalamus</BrainRegion> of the prenatal mouse.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Mouse embryos from day 13 to day 19 of gestation (E13 through E19) were removed by Caesarean section and their brains were prepared for electron microscopy. Coronal sections were examined in three planes through the <BrainRegion>ventromedial hypothalamus</BrainRegion>: anterior, the level at which the optic tracts pass posterolaterally to become partially enclosed in the major brain mass; middle, the level at which the floor of the <BrainRegion>third ventricle</BrainRegion> begins to widen and flatten; posterior, the level at which the most <BrainRegion>anterior infundibulum</BrainRegion> appears. Three types of junctional complexes were examined. Close junctions are identified as straight, parallel areas of two apposed membranes which appear more electron-dense than immediately adjacent regions. The membranes are separated by a clearly visible cleft. Unlike synapses, no clear synaptic vesicles are found in either of the adjacent profiles unless randomly distributed and accompanied by ribosomes or glycogen. Close junctions are seen most frequently on day E15, then decrease in number through E19. Their participation in synaptogenesis is discussed from temporal, morphological, distributional and quantitative perspectives and is provisionally rejected. Immature synapses show only the minimal membrane specialization found in close junctions, but vesicles are present, ribosomes absent in at least one of the adjacent cytoplasms. Their appearance peaks on E17-E18, paralleling and slightly preceding that of the mature synapses. Their evolution from close junctions has only weak temporal support. Mature synapses display the cytoplasmic densities which immature synapses lack. They attain their greatest prenatal numbers on E18, then decrease in number on E19. The conclusion is advanced that synaptogenesis does--or at least can--occur without the prior appearance of avesicular regions of increased membrane density.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Organization of the <BrainRegion>efferent vestibular nuclei</BrainRegion> and nerves of the toadfish, Opsanus tau.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The <BrainRegion>efferent vestibular nuclei</BrainRegion> and nerves were studied in the toadfish, Opsanus tau, with morphological and electrophysiological techniques. The origin and course of the efferent vestibular nerves was extensively documented. One major morphological observation was that the efferent nerves comprise a peripheral network that is anatomically distinct, and separable by dissection from the primary afferents innervated by each end organ. These anatomically distinct nerves are likely to be a major asset in physiological studies of efferent vestibular function. The retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) from each of the nerves innervating the <BrainRegion>vestibular and lateral line organs</BrainRegion> was used to delineate the subgroups of efferent neurons projecting to these end organs. The <BrainRegion>efferent vestibular nuclei</BrainRegion> are located in the <BrainRegion>posterior medulla</BrainRegion> in and around the median longitudinal fasciculi (MLF). We divided the nuclei cytoarchitecturally into lateral, medial, and dorsal subdivisions. The lateral cells had bilateral dendritic trees while the dorsal cells had ipsilateral, unilateral dendritic trees. There was a higher proportion of lateral cells that innervated the <BrainRegion>canal organs</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>utricle</BrainRegion> while the dorsal cells tended to innervate the other organs. The total number of cells obtained by summing those from separate nerve label was twice the total cell count present in the nuclei. Indirectly, this indicates that some cells project to more than one end organ. Efferent neurons were penetrated with glass microelectrodes, and their end organs and patterns of connectivity with other end organs were investigated by stimulating various vestibular nerves. <BrainRegion>Posterior semicircular canal</BrainRegion> efferent cells are electrically coupled to each other and could be activated electrically or chemically by stimulating other ipsilateral or contralateral vestibular nerves. It is suggested that electrical coupling might be responsible for the uniform behavior of these cells under certain conditions. Morphological and physiological experiments suggested that the <BrainRegion>semicircular canals</BrainRegion> are innervated by their own, exclusive populations of efferent neurons while other end organs may share efferent innervation. Single cells were injected intracellularly with horseradish peroxidase(HRP) and their morphology was studied and characterized by light microscopy. Intracellular label confirmed the morphological features demonstrated by retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase(HRP) and also revealed that some cells had central axon collaterals that terminated within the median longitudinal fasciculi(MLF) . These morphological and physiological results provide a basis for understanding the behavior of efferent vestibular neurons in the alert animal.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Primary afferent projections to the <BrainRegion>central octavus nuclei</BrainRegion> in the elasmobranch, Rhinobatos sp., as demonstrated by nerve degeneration.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Nerve degeneration studies were performed to determine the central projections of the octavus nerve in the guitarfish. Rhinobatos sp. Most first-order <BrainRegion>octavus nerve</BrainRegion> afferents are confined to the <BrainRegion>ventral longitudinal column of the medulla</BrainRegion>, which consists of four <BrainRegion>octavus nuclei</BrainRegion>: the <BrainRegion>nucleus octavus anterior</BrainRegion> (NOA), <BrainRegion>nucleus octavus magnocellularis</BrainRegion> (NOM), <BrainRegion>nucleus octavus descendens</BrainRegion> (NOD); and <BrainRegion>nucleus octavus posterior</BrainRegion> (NOP). Central projections of the <BrainRegion>octavus nerve</BrainRegion> outside of the <BrainRegion>ventral octavus nuclear column</BrainRegion> are to the <BrainRegion>vestibulolateral lobe of the cerebellum</BrainRegion>, the large multipolar cells that lie deep to the <BrainRegion>cerebellar crest of nucleus intermedius</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>reticular formation</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>nucleus octavolateralis efferens</BrainRegion>. In addition, the cytoarchitectural features of the four <BrainRegion>octavus nuclei</BrainRegion> have been analyzed: the <BrainRegion>nucleus octavus anterior</BrainRegion>(NOA) consists of large spindle-shaped neurons and medium-sized multipolar neurons; the <BrainRegion>nucleus octavus magnocellularis</BrainRegion>(NOM) is a small nucleus consisting of very large multipolar neurons; the <BrainRegion>nucleus octavus descendens</BrainRegion>(NOD) contains several types of neurons including large spindle-shaped neurons, large multipolar neurons, and polymorphic small and medium-sized neurons; and the <BrainRegion>nucleus octavus posterior</BrainRegion>(NOP) contains small spherical and small multipolar neurons evenly distributed throughout the nucleus. On the basis of the morphology of the neurons, the <BrainRegion>nucleus octavus anterior</BrainRegion>(NOA) and <BrainRegion>nucleus octavus descendens</BrainRegion>(NOD) appear to have subdivisions suggesting a more complex organization of the <BrainRegion>octavus nuclear column</BrainRegion> than previously recognized.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Innervation and structure of extraocular muscles in the monkey in comparison to those of the cat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Motoneurones that innervate the medial rectus, lateral rectus, and accessory lateral rectus muscles in the monkey have been identified and localized by retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase. Medial rectus motoneurones were located within both dorsal and ventral regions of the <BrainRegion>oculomotor nucleus</BrainRegion>, with a differential distribution along the rostral-caudal axis of the nucleus. Lateral rectus motoneurones were located predominantly within the <BrainRegion>abducens nucleus</BrainRegion>, and were distributed throughout the rostral-caudal extent of the nucleus. Motoneurons that innervate the accessory lateral rectus muscle comprised a group of large cells located approximately 0.5 mm ventral to the rostral portion of the <BrainRegion>abducens nucleus</BrainRegion>, corresponding to the <BrainRegion>ventral abducens nucleus of Tsuchida</BrainRegion> (&apos;06). The ventral subgroup of abducens motoneurones, which innervate both the lateral rectus and accessory lateral rectus muscles, thus do not occupy a motoneurones innervate the retractor bulbi muscle, to which the accessory lateral rectus muscle presumably is homologous. A few accessory lateral rectus motoneurones also were located within the <BrainRegion>abducens nucleus</BrainRegion>, overlapping the distribution of lateral rectus motoneurones. Electron microscope examination of the lateral rectus muscle revealed the presence of three morphological types of singly innervated muscle fibers and two morphological types of multiply innervated muscle fibers that exhibited a differential distribution within the orbital, intermediate, and global regions of the muscle. The accessory lateral rectus muscle resembled the global portion of the lateral rectus muscle in containing two morphological types of singly innervated fibers and one type of multiply innervated fiber. These findings indicate that the central differences in the <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion> locations of motoneurones that innervate the cat retractor bulbi and monkey accessory lateral rectus muscles are correlated with peripheral differences not only in the morphology, but also possibly in the mechanical roles, of the muscles they innervate. The accessory lateral rectus muscle thus appears to have evolved both structurally and functionally toward more of a role in patterned eye movement. Furthermore, with the phylogenetic regression of the retractor bulbi muscle, the various types of eye movement with which this muscle is associated in lower vertebrates may be assumed by the other extraocular muscles in higher mammals, including humans.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Regeneration of axons from the adult rat <BrainRegion>optic nerve</BrainRegion>: influence of fetal brain grafts, laminin, and artificial basement membrane.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>After transection of the <BrainRegion>optic nerve</BrainRegion> of adult rats, most of the axons in the proximal stump die and the surviving ones are unable to regenerate into the <BrainRegion>distal optic nerve</BrainRegion>. Since the fetal brain has an inherent capacity to regenerate axons, we investigated whether fetal (E16) target regions of optic axons (<BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>tectum</BrainRegion>) transplanted to the completely transected <BrainRegion>optic nerve</BrainRegion> of adult rats would promote axon regeneration. In control operated rats, axon growth beyond the site of transection was restricted to a few fibers that grew irregularly within the connective tissue scar. By contrast, in grafted animals directed outgrowth of <BrainRegion>optic</BrainRegion> axons toward the transplant started at 6 days postoperation (p.o.) and reached its maximum 15 days postoperation(p.o.) and later, when numerous single <BrainRegion>optic</BrainRegion> fibers and small axon fascicles had grown toward and into the graft, where they formed arborizations and terminal varicosities. Regenerating <BrainRegion>optic</BrainRegion> axons were further advanced than GFAP-positive strands of astroglia that emanated from the postoperation(p.o.) imal <BrainRegion>optic nerve</BrainRegion> stump. Laminin immunoreactivity appeared at 6 days postoperation(p.o.) in the zone of reactive astroglia in the terminal part of the <BrainRegion>optic nerve</BrainRegion> stump. Later it showed a distribution complementary to the pattern of GFAP immunoreactivity, which it seemd to circumscribe. There was no unequivocal codistribution of laminin immunoreactivity with regenerating axons. In further experiments, target regions from different ontogenetic stages (E14 to neonate and adult) and nontarget regions (E16, <BrainRegion>cerebral cortex</BrainRegion> or <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>) were grafted to the <BrainRegion>optic nerve</BrainRegion> stump. With the exception of the adult grafts, all transplants had effects on axon regeneration comparable to those of E16 target regions. In order to test the effects of extracellular matrix molecules on axon regeneration, a basement membrane gel reconstituted from individual components of the Engelbreth-Holm-Sarcoma (EHS) sarcoma was implanted between postoperation(p.o.) imal and distal <BrainRegion>optic nerve</BrainRegion> stumps. No axons were induced to regenerate by this matrix. Likewise, laminin adsorbed to nitrocellulose paper and implanted at the lesion site did not stimulate axon growth from the postoperation(p.o.) imal <BrainRegion>optic nerve</BrainRegion> stump. These results indicate that fetal brain is able to induce and direct regrowth of axons from the <BrainRegion>optic nerve</BrainRegion> toward the graft across a substrate that is not composed of astroglia or basement membrane components like laminin. The directed growth of axons in the absence of a preformed substrate implies a chemotactic growth response along a concentration gradient mediated by neurotropic molecules released from the graft.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Localization of glycine receptor alpha subunits on bipolar and amacrine cells in primate <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The major inhibitory neurotransmitter glycine is used by about half of the amacrine cells in the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>. Amacrine cells provide synaptic output to bipolar, ganglion, and other amacrine cells. The present study investigated whether different bipolar and amacrine cell types in the primate <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> differ with respect to the expression of glycine receptor (GlyR) subtypes. Antibodies specific for the alpha1, alpha2, and alpha3 subunits of the glycine receptor(GlyR) were combined with immunohistochemical markers for bipolar and amacrine cells and applied to vertical sections of macaque (Macaca fascicularis) and marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) <BrainRegion>retinae</BrainRegion>. For all subunits, punctate immunoreactivity was expressed in the inner plexiform layer. The glycine receptor(GlyR) alpha2 immunoreactive (IR) puncta occur at the highest density, followed by glycine receptor(GlyR) (alpha)3 and glycine receptor(GlyR) (alpha)1 immunoreactive(IR) puncta. Postembedding electron microscopy showed the postsynaptic location of all subunits. Double immunofluorescence demonstrated that the three alpha subunits are clustered at different postsynaptic sites. Two OFF cone bipolar cell types (flat midget and diffuse bipolar DB3), are predominantly associated with the alpha1 subunit. Two ON bipolar cell types, the DB6 and the rod bipolar cell, are predominantly associated with the alpha2 subunit. The glycinergic AII amacrine cell is presynaptic to the alpha1 subunit in the OFF-sublamina, and postsynaptic to the alpha2 subunit in the ON-sublamina. Another putative glycinergic cell, the vesicular glutamate transporter 3 cell, is predominantly presynaptic to the alpha2 subunit. The dopaminergic amacrine cell expresses the alpha3 subunit at a low density.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Mechanically evoked reflex electrogenic chloride secretion in rat distal colon is triggered by endogenous nucleotides acting at P2Y1, P2Y2, and P2Y4 receptors.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Mechanical activation of the mucosal lining of the colon by brush stroking elicits an intestinal neural reflex and an increase in short circuit current (Isc) indicative of electrogenic chloride ion transport. We tested whether endogenous nucleotides are physiologic regulators of mucosal reflexes that control ion transport. The brush stroking-evoked in short circuit current(Isc) response in mucosa and submucosa preparations (M-SMP) of rat colon was reduced by the P2Y1 receptor (R) antagonist 2&apos;deoxy-N6-methyl adenosine 3',5'-diphosphate diammonium salt (MRS 2179) and further blocked by tetrodotoxin (TTX). mucosa and submucosa preparations(M-SMP) in short circuit current(Isc) responses to serosal application of the P2Y1 R agonist 2-methylthioadenosine-diphosphate (2MeSADP) or the P2Y2/P2Y4 R agonist 5'uridine-triphosphate (UTP) were reduced but not abolished by tetrodotoxin(TTX) . The potency profile of nucleotides for increasing in short circuit current(Isc) was 5'adenosine-triphosphate (ATP; effective concentration at half maximal response [EC50] 0.65 x 10(4) M) congruent with 5'uridine-triphosphate(UTP) (EC50 1.0 x 10(-4) M) congruent with 2MeSADP (EC50 = 1.60 x 10(-4) M). Mucosal touch and distention-induced Ca2+ transients in submucous neurons were reduced by apyrase and prevented by blocking the P2Y1 R with MRS 2179 and tetrodotoxin(TTX) ; denervation of the mucosa. It did not occur by touching a ganglion d immunoreactivity(ir) ectly. 2MeSADP Ca2+ responses occurred in subsets of neurons with or without substance P (SP) responses. The potency profile of nucleotides on the neural Ca2+ response was 2MeSADP (5 x 10(-7) M) &gt; 5'uridine-triphosphate(UTP) (6 x 10(-6) M) &gt; 5'adenosine-triphosphate(ATP) (9 x 10(-5) M). The expression of P2Y R immunoreactivity ( immunoreactivity(ir) ) in nerve cell bodies was in the order of P2Y1 R &gt; P2Y4 R &gt;&gt; P2Y2 R. P2Y1R immunoreactivity(ir) occurred in the cell somas of more than 90% of neuronal nitric oxide synthase, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), calretinin, or neuropeptide Y (NPY)- immunoreactivity(ir) neurons, 78% of somatostatin neurons, but not in calbindin or substance P(SP) neurons. P2Y2 R immunoreactivity(ir) was expressed in a minority of substance P(SP) , vasoactive intestinal peptide(VIP) , neuropeptide Y(NPY) , vesicular acetylcholine transporter, and calcitonin gene-related peptide- immunoreactivity(ir) varicose fibers (5-20%) and those surrounding calbindin (5-20%) neurons. P2Y4 immunoreactivity(ir) occurred mainly in the cell somas of 93% of neuropeptide Y(NPY) neurons. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction of the submucosa demonstrated mRNA for P2Y1R, P2Y2, P2Y4, P2Y6, and P2Y12 Rs. Expression of P2Y1, P2Y2, and P2Y4 protein was conf immunoreactivity(ir) med by western blots. In conclusion, endogenous nucleotides acting at P2YRs transduce mechanically evoked reflex chloride ion transport in rat distal colon. Nucleotides evoke reflexes by acting primarily at postsynaptic P2Y1 Rs and P2Y4 R on vasoactive intestinal peptide(VIP) +/ neuropeptide Y(NPY) + secretomotor neurons, at P2Y2 Rs on no more than 2% of vasoactive intestinal peptide(VIP) + secretomotor neurons, and 2Y2 Rs mainly of extrinsic varicose fibers surrounding putative intrinsic primary afferent and secretomotor neurons. During mucosal mechanical reflexes, it is postulated that P2Y1 R, P2Y2 R, and P2Y4 R are activated by endogenous 5'adenosine-triphosphate(ATP) , 5'uridine-triphosphate(UTP) , and 5'uridine-diphosphate.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Desert toads discriminate salt taste with chemosensory function of the ventral skin.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Toads obtain water by absorption across their skin. When dehydrated, desert toads exhibit stereotyped hydration behavior in which they press their ventral skin onto a moist surface. However, dehydrated toads avoid surfaces moistened with hyperosmotic NaCl and KCl solutions (Hoff KvS, Hillyard SD. 1993. J. Exp. Biol. 183:347-351). We have studied neural mechanisms for this avoidance with physiologic, behavioral, and morphologic approaches. Spinal nerves innervating the ventral skin could be stimulated by exposure to a hyperosmotic NaCl solution applied to the outer surface of the skin. This neural response occurred with much longer latency than to mechanical stimulation and could be reduced by amiloride, a blocker for Na+ channels known to be responsible for epithelial ion transport and salt taste transduction. In behavioral experiments, avoidance of a NaCl solution was also reduced by adding amiloride to the solution, suggesting involvement of amiloride-sensitive Na+ channels for detecting the hyperosmotic salt solution. Neural tracing with fluorescent dye revealed spinal nerve endings and connections to putative receptor cells, both located in the deeper layer of the epidermis. Either of these or both may be associated with the transduction of Na+ flowing into the skin. The ability of toads to detect hyperosmotic salt solutions in their environment reveals a previously unknown chemosensory function for spinal nerves in anuran amphibians.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Patterns of cell death in mouse <BrainRegion>anteroventral cochlear nucleus</BrainRegion> neurons after unilateral <BrainRegion>cochlea</BrainRegion> removal.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Developmental changes that influence the results of removal of afferent input on the survival of neurons of the <BrainRegion>anteroventral cochlear nucleus</BrainRegion> (AVCN) of mice were examined with the hope of providing a suitable model for understanding the cellular and molecular basis for these developmental changes in susceptibility. We performed unilateral cochlear ablation on wild-type mice at a variety of ages around the time of hearing onset to determine developmental changes in the sensitivity of <BrainRegion>anteroventral cochlear nucleus</BrainRegion>(AVCN) neurons to afferent deprivation. In postnatal day 5 (P5) mice, cochlea removal resulted in 61% neuronal loss in the <BrainRegion>anteroventral cochlear nucleus</BrainRegion>(AVCN) . By age P14, fewer than 1% of <BrainRegion>anteroventral cochlear nucleus</BrainRegion>(AVCN) neurons were lost after this manipulation. This reveals a rather abrupt change in the sensitivity to disruption of afferent input, a critical period. We next investigated the temporal events associated with neuron loss after <BrainRegion>cochlea</BrainRegion> removal in susceptible animals. We demonstrate that significant cell loss occurs within 48 hours of <BrainRegion>cochlea</BrainRegion> removal in P7 animals. Furthermore, evidence of apoptosis was observed within 12 hours of <BrainRegion>cochlea</BrainRegion> removal, suggesting that the molecular events leading to cell loss after afferent deprivation begin to occur within hours of <BrainRegion>cochlea</BrainRegion> removal. Finally, we began to examine the role of the bcl-2 gene family in regulating afferent deprivation-induced cell death in the mouse <BrainRegion>anteroventral cochlear nucleus</BrainRegion>(AVCN) . <BrainRegion>anteroventral cochlear nucleus</BrainRegion>(AVCN) neurons in mature bcl-2 knockout mice demonstrate susceptibility to removal of afferent input comparable to neonatal sensitivity of wild-type controls. These data suggest that bcl-2 is one effector of cell survival as these cells switch from afferent-dependent to -independent survival mechanisms.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Distribution of omega-Conotoxin GVIA binding sites in teleost <BrainRegion>cerebellar</BrainRegion> and electrosensory neurons.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The distribution of omega-Conotoxin GVIA (CgTx) binding sites was used to localize putative N-type Ca2+ channels in an electrosensory <BrainRegion>cerebellar lobule</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>eminentia granularis pars posterior</BrainRegion>, and in the <BrainRegion>electrosensory lateral line lobe</BrainRegion> of a gymnotiform teleost (Apteronotus leptorhynchus). The binding sites for CgTx revealed by an anti-CgTx antibody had a consistent distribution on somatic and dendritic membranes of specific cell types in both structures. The distribution of CgTx binding was unaffected by co-incubation with nifedipine or AgaToxin IVA, blocking agents for L- and P-type Ca2+ channels, respectively. Incubation with CgTx in the presence of varying levels of extracellular Ca2+ altered the number but not the cell types exhibiting immunolabel. A punctate immunolabel was detected on somatic membranes of granule and stellate cell interneurons in both the <BrainRegion>eminentia granularis pars posterior</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>electrosensory lateral line lobe</BrainRegion>. Punctate CgTx binding sites were also present on spherical cell somata and on the large presynaptic terminals of primary afferents that terminate on spherical cells in the <BrainRegion>electrosensory lateral line lobe</BrainRegion>. No label was detected in association with distal dendritic membranes of any cell class, or with parallel fibers in the respective molecular layers. Binding sites for CgTx in the eminentia granularis are consistent with the established role for N-type Ca2+ channels in cell migrations, an activity which is known to persist in this layer in adult Apteronotus. The distribution of labeled stellate cells with respect to topographic maps in the electrosensory lateral line lobe further suggest that N-type Ca2+ channels are expressed in relation to functional activity across these sensory maps.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Dual mode of corticothalamic synaptic termination in the <BrainRegion>mediodorsal nucleus</BrainRegion> of the rhesus monkey.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Electron microscopic autoradiography (EM-ARG) was used to assess the synaptic organization of corticothalamic terminals in the <BrainRegion>parvicellular division of the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>. Examination of the synaptic organization in unreacted tissue revealed several distinct synaptic types distributed among glomerular and nonglomerular regions of the neuropil. Within glomeruli, three presynaptic terminal classes were found. The majority of profiles (as many as eight to ten per glomerulus) were presynaptic dendrites (PSDs) forming symmetric synaptic contacts with a central dendrite, and occasionally with other presynaptic dendrites(PSDs) . One or two large terminals densely packed with round vesicles (LR terminals) were also present in each glomerulus. This terminal class made multiple asymmetric contacts with the central dendrite, as well as with many presynaptic dendrites(PSDs) within the glomerulus. Finally, small terminals with round vesicles (SR terminals) formed asymmetric synaptic junctions with presynaptic dendrites(PSDs) in some glomeruli. presynaptic dendrites(PSDs) and SR terminals were also found in the extraglomerular neuropil, although in different proportions than in the glomeruli. In the extraglomerular neuropil SR terminals were the most abundant terminal class and these terminals made synaptic contacts with dendrites of all sizes. presynaptic dendrites(PSDs) were seen in considerably smaller numbers than in the glomeruli. Finally, the extraglomerular neuropil contained a moderate number of small to medium terminals that formed symmetric synaptic junctions (SF terminals) with cell bodies and dendrites of all sizes. Synaptic profiles related to corticothalamic inputs were identified by injecting the <BrainRegion>prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion> of two rhesus monkeys with 3H-leucine and -proline and analyzing the distribution and morphology of radiolabeled terminals. Quantitative analysis of the density of silver grains over different tissue compartments revealed a positive labeling index for two terminal classes: SR and LR terminals. Labeled SR terminals were concentrated in the extraglomerular neuropil and labeled LR terminals were found within glomeruli where they formed synaptic contact with the central dendrite, as well as with presynaptic dendrites of the glomerulus. In contrast to many other <BrainRegion>thalamic nuclei</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> input to the <BrainRegion>mediodorsal nucleus</BrainRegion> arrives via two distinctive synaptic pathways, one terminating extraglomerularly and the other terminating within the synaptic glomeruli. The dual mode of corticothalamic terminations in the <BrainRegion>mediodorsal nucleus</BrainRegion> suggests a more potent and possibly different role for <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> input in the regulation of neuronal activity in this association nucleus than in <BrainRegion>sensory nuclei of the thalamus</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Immunohistochemical localization of a membrane-associated, 4.1-like protein in the rat <BrainRegion>visual cortex</BrainRegion> during postnatal development.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Expression and localization of a membrane-associated protein, an analog of erythrocyte protein 4.1, in the <BrainRegion>visual cortex</BrainRegion> were immunohistochemically studied in the rat, ranging in age from newborn to adult. In the adult, dendrites and somas of layer V pyramidal cells were stained by the antiprotein 4.1 antibody. In most of these immunoreactive neurons, the plasma membrane seemed to be preferentially stained. Neurons located in layers II and III of the <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion> were only faintly stained, and those in layers IV and VI were not stained. At birth, the immunoreactivity was already present in pyramidal cells located in the upper part of the <BrainRegion>cortical subplate</BrainRegion>. Immature neurons located in the <BrainRegion>cortical plate</BrainRegion> were not stained by the antibody, suggesting that the 4.1-like protein is expressed only in the neurons that have differentiated or are differentiating. At postnatal days 2-8, immunoreactive neurons were dramatically increased in layers V and VI and intense labeling was seen at the apical dendrites of layer V pyramidal cells. Most of the stained processes of these and other neurons showed a sign of rapid dendritic growth, i.e., growth cones and filopidia. At days 10-17, the basal dendrites of pyramidal cells in layers II and III became detectable, although still slender. At days 20-37, these dendrites in layers II, III, and V became intensely immunoreactive, and dendritic spines were visualized by the antibody. Throughout all the ages, axons of neurons and neuroglia were not stained by the antibody. Also, most of the neurons in layer IV of the <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion> were not immunoreactive. These results suggest that the 4.1-like protein is abundantly expressed in growing parts of the dendrites and spines. A hypothesis that this protein may play a role in synaptic plasticity in the developing <BrainRegion>visual cortex</BrainRegion> is discussed.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Vesicular glutamate transporter 3 expression identifies glutamatergic amacrine cells in the rodent <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Synaptic transmission from glutamatergic neurons requires vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUTs) to concentrate cytosolic glutamate in synaptic vesicles. In <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>, glutamatergic photoreceptors and bipolar cells exclusively express the VGLUT1 isoform, whereas ganglion cells express VGLUT2. Surprisingly, the recently identified VGLUT3 isoform was found in presumed amacrine cells, generally considered to be inhibitory interneurons. To investigate the synaptic machinery and conceivable secondary neurotransmitter composition of VGLUT3 cells, and to determine a potential functional role, we further investigated these putative glutamatergic amacrine cells in adult and developing rodent <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>. Reverse transcriptase-PCR substantiated VGLUT3 expression in mouse <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>. VGLUT3 cells did not immunostain for ganglion or bipolar cell markers, providing evidence that they are amacrine cells. VGLUT3 colocalized with synaptic vesicle markers, and electron microscopy showed that VGLUT3 immunostained synaptic vesicles. VGLUT3 cells were not immunoreactive for amacrine cell markers gamma-aminobutyric acid, choline acetyltransferase, calretinin, or tyrosine hydroxylase, although they immunostain for glycine. VGLUT3 processes made synaptic contact with ganglion cell dendrites, suggesting input onto these cells. VGLUT3 immunostaining was closely associated with the metabotropic glutamate receptor 4, which is consistent with glutamatergic synaptic exocytosis by these cells. In the maturing mouse <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>, Western blots showed VGLUT3 expression at postnatal day 7/8 (P7/8). VGLUT3 immunostaining in <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> sections was first observed at P8, achieving an adult pattern at P12. Thus, VGLUT3 function commences around the same time as VGLUT1-mediated glutamatergic transmission from bipolar cells. Furthermore, a subset of VGLUT3 cells expressed the circadian clock gene period 1, implicating VGLUT3 cells as part of the light-entrainable <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>-based circadian system.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Differential subcellular localization of cholesterol, gangliosides, and glycosaminoglycans in murine models of mucopolysaccharide storage disorders.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The mucopolysaccharidoses (MPSs) are a complex family of lysosomal storage disorders characterized by failure to degrade heparan sulfate (HS) and/or other types of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) secondary to the absence of specific lysosomal enzymes. An accompanying storage of glycosphingolipids (GSLs), most notably GM2 and GM3 gangliosides, has also been documented to occur in many types of MPS disease and is believed to be caused by secondary inhibition of GSL-degradative enzymes by intracellular GAG accumulation. We have documented the presence of secondary ganglioside accumulation in mouse models of several MPS disorders (types I, IIIA, IIIB, and VII) and report that this storage is accompanied by sequestration of free cholesterol in a manner similar to that observed in primary gangliosidoses. Using confocal microscopy, we evaluated the cellular distribution of cholesterol, GM2 and GM3 gangliosides, and heparan sulfate(HS) in brains of mice with MPS IIIA disease. Unexpectedly, we found that although both gangliosides often accumulated in the same neurons, they were consistently located in separate populations of cytoplasmic vesicles. Additionally, GM3 ganglioside only partially co-localized with the primary storage material ( heparan sulfate(HS) ), and cholesterol likewise only partially co-localized with the GM2 and GM3 gangliosides. These findings raise significant questions about the mechanism(s) responsible for secondary accumulation of storage materials in MPS disease. Furthermore, given that glycosphingolipids(GSLs) and cholesterol are constituents of membrane rafts believed critical in signal transduction events in neurons, their co-sequestration in individual neurons suggests the presence of defects in the composition, trafficking, and/or recycling of raft components and thus possible new mechanisms to explain neuronal dysfunction in MPS disorders.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Sex differences in dendritic morphology of a <BrainRegion>song control nucleus</BrainRegion> in the canary: a quantitative Golgi study.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Singing in the canary is a learned male behavior controlled predominantly by <BrainRegion>nuclei in the left hemisphere</BrainRegion> (Nottebohm and Nottebohm, &apos;76; Nottebohm et al., '76; Nottebohm, '77). These nuclei are several times larger in males than in females (Nottebohm and Arnold, '76). One of the <BrainRegion>telencephalic song control nuclei</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>robustus archistriatalis</BrainRegion> (RA), was examined in Golgi-stained tissue sections from the left and right hemispheres of male and female canaries. At least four cell classes were present in each sex. One of these cell classes was further studied with a variety of quantitative techniques. No hemispheric differences were seen in either sex. However, dendrites from male cells tend to branch and end further from the cell body than do dendrites from female cells. This difference is seen most clearly when serial sections are used to reconstruct the entire dendritic tree.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Distribution and morphology of <BrainRegion>callosal</BrainRegion> commissural neurons within the <BrainRegion>motor cortex</BrainRegion> of normal and reeler mice.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase was used to examine the cells of origin of the <BrainRegion>callosal</BrainRegion> commissural fibers (CC neurons) in the <BrainRegion>primary motor cortex</BrainRegion> of normal and reeler mice. Quantitative analysis of the intracortical, laminar distribution, and dendritic orientation of CC neurons was performed in conjunction with qualitative observation of their morphology. For comparison, similar quantitative data were obtained for the cells of origin of the corticospinal tract (CST) of normal and reeler mice from materials described previously by Terashima et al. (&apos;83). In the normal mouse, CC neurons are distributed in a bilaminar pattern such that the largest number of cells are located in supragranular layers II and III and in infragranular layer V. The majority of CC neurons are normal (upright) pyramids, although a few in the upper zone of layer VI are inverted pyramidal cells. In the reeler mutant, CC neurons are found in all <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> layers, but two-thirds are situated in the lower half of the <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion>. On the basis of the celL shape and orientation of the apical dendrite, CC neurons of the reeler were classified into six morphological types: (1) typical pyramidal, (2) inverted pyramidal, (3) tumbled, (4) hook-shaped, (5) polymorphic, and (6) simple. The apical dendrites of the CC neurons in all layers of the <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion> of the reeler mouse are randomly oriented; no direct relationship between the intracortical position of the soma and orientation of the apical dendrite was found. In contrast, corticospinal tract(CST) neurons in the reeler mutant are concentrated in the outer third of the <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion>, and there is a relationship between the laminar distribution of these cells and the alignment of their dendrites with respect to the pial surface: the apical dendrites of corticospinal tract(CST) neurons lie in superficial layers tend to be oriented obliquely, whereas those of corticospinal tract(CST) neurons in the deeper of <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion> most often are oriented vertically, i.e, toward the pial surface. Quantitative analysis revealed that the relative intracortical positions of CC and corticospinal tract(CST) neurons are reversed in the reeler mutant although both populations exhibited greater laminar disposition, and as a consequence, there is more intermingling of the two cell groups in the reeler than in the normal mouse. Thus, the present study suggests that the normal cytoarchitectonics of the <BrainRegion>primary motor cortex</BrainRegion> are inverted in the reeler mutant mouse.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>A comparison of synapses onto the somata of intrinsically bursting and regular spiking neurons in layer V of rat SmI <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Regular spiking (RS) and intrinsically bursting (IB) neurons show distinct differences in their inhibitory responses. Under various conditions, the synaptic responses of Regular spiking(RS) cells display marked inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs), whereas the responses of most intrinsically bursting(IB) cells do not (Silva et al: Soc Neurosci Abstr 14:883, 1988; Chagnac-Amitai and Connors: J Neurophysiol 61:747, 62:1149, 1989; Connors and Gutnick: TINS 13:99, 1990). This investigation is designed to determine if differences in the inhibitory responses of Regular spiking(RS) versus intrinsically bursting(IB) cells are reflected in differences in the concentration of inhibitory synapses onto their somata. Regular spiking(RS) and intrinsically bursting(IB) neurons in rat <BrainRegion>somatosensory cortex</BrainRegion> were identified by using intracellular recording and labeling, examined with the light microscope, and then serial thin-sectioned prior to examination with the electron microscope. Axonal terminals presynaptic to their somata and proximal dendrites were identified and classified according to criteria described by Peters and coworkers (Peters et al: J Neurocytol 19:584, 1990; Peters and Harriman: J Neurocytol 19:154, 1990; 21:679, 1992). The locations of these boutons were displayed on the surfaces of 3-D reconstructions of the somata and proximal dendrites. The reconstructions were produced directly from the serial thin sections by using a novel, electron microscopic, image-processing computer resource. Our analysis showed no significant difference in the types and concentration of boutons presynaptic to the cell bodies and proximal dendrites of intrinsically bursting versus regular spiking neurons. We conclude that the differences observed in the inhibitory responses of intrinsically bursting versus regular spiking neurons cannot be explained by differences in the concentrations of synapses onto their somata.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Developmental and other factors affecting regeneration of crayfish CNS axons.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>According to histological and ultrastructural criteria, nongiant CNS axons in newly hatched crayfish regenerate more rapidly and with greater frequency than do similar axons in adult crayfish. Regenerative ability is greater in one species (Procambarus clarkii) than in another species (Procambarus simulans), is greater at 20-25 degrees C than at 15-16 degrees C, and is greater in nongiant axons than in giant axons. In contrast to axonal regeneration, nerve cell bodies do not regenerate in newly hatched or adult crayfish of either species. While the ability to regenerate CNS axons differs between newly hatched and adult crayfish, the ultrastructural appearance of the CNS is very similar at any age it is examined.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Ultrastructural localization of gustducin immunoreactivity in microvilli of type II taste cells in the rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Gustducin is a transducin-like G protein (guanine nucleotide-binding protein) that is expressed in taste bud cells. Gustducin is believed to be involved in bitter and possibly sweet taste transduction. In the present study, we demonstrate that a subset of type II cells displays immunoreactivity to antisera directed against gustducin in taste buds of rat circumvallate papilla. Immunogold particles are present both in the microvilli and cytoplasm of the immunoreactive cells. Quantitative analysis of the data suggests that the number of colloidal gold particles (P&amp;lt;0.001) and nanogold particles (P&lt;0.01) in the immunoreactive type II cells are much greater than in type I cells. There are also approximately 2.5 times (P&lt;0.05) as many colloidal gold particles associated with the microvilli versus the cytoplasm in the immunoreactive type II cells. The ultrastructural distribution of gustducin immunoreactivity is consistent with its proposed role in the initial events of sensory transduction by gustatory receptor cells.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Free will versus survival: brain systems that underlie intrinsic constraints on behavior.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>This article discusses the neuroanatomical systems involved in the related functions of fear and discernment of the consequences of one&apos;s actions, two internal constraints on free will and action. Both mechanisms are related to a system for control and modulation of visceral function stretching from the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>ventromedial prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion>, including the <BrainRegion>ventral striatum</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>ventral pallidum</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>mediodorsal thalamus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>amygdala</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion> (PAG), and the <BrainRegion>brainstem reticular formation</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>autonomic nuclei</BrainRegion>. Reflexes at the lower levels provide rapid visceral and somatic reactions to threatening stimuli, while the <BrainRegion>periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion>(PAG) and <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion> coordinate these to produce more concerted responses. The <BrainRegion>amygdala</BrainRegion> interacts with the <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> sensory systems in the assessment of fear-related stimuli and modulates the reflex responses through projections to the <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>ventromedial prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion>, especially the &quot;medial prefrontal network," is connected to the <BrainRegion>amygdala</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion>(PAG) , and allows <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> control over the system in relation to a wider set of emotions. This cortical region is involved both in the assessment of reward and in mood disorders and it plays a central role in the ability to discern the consequences of one&apos;s actions and make appropriate behavioral choices. It also forms an interconnected circuit with specific <BrainRegion>cortical areas</BrainRegion> in the <BrainRegion>rostral superior temporal cortex</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>posterior parahippocampal cortex</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>retrosplenial/posterior cingulate cortex</BrainRegion>. The overall function of this circuit is unclear, but may be involved in introspective monitoring of the individual.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Axonal domains within shared touch domes in the rat: a comparison of their fate during conditions favoring collateral sprouting and following axonal regeneration.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Low-threshold mechanosensory nerves in the adult rat differ both from their counterparts in lower vertebrates and from high-threshold nociceptive nerves in mammals in that they appear not to undergo collateral sprouting into adjacent denervated skin, although they will clearly regenerate into it after they are damaged. We have now studied the growth capabilities of the low-threshold nerves supplying touch domes, the visible mechanosensory structures scattered throughout the hairy skin. Touch domes in the rat are often multiply innervated. A serendipitous observation on such domes allowed us to investigate the possibility that a functional collateral sprouting of their nerves can indeed occur, but only to a spatially very restricted extent, e.g., within the confines of a partially denervated dome. We used a &quot;prodder" with a tip diameter of 16 micron to examine the mechanosensory profile across single domes that were preselected as being supplied by only two axons, one running in each of two adjacent dorsal cutaneous nerves (DCNs). Simultaneous recordings were made of the afferent discharges evoked in these nerves when the prodder was applied at about 17 or more locations on a selected dome; the spatial resolution was better than 55 micron. We found that within such a shared dome, one axon can supply a discrete territory (its "domain"), which may or may not overlap with the corresponding domain of the other axon. In a preliminary electron microscopic study, we found no evidence for a sharing of single Merkel cells, which are the specialized sensory cells in touch domes, even in the regions of a shared dome where two domains overlapped; each innervated Merkel cell appeared to be contacted by a single nerve ending, implying that in a shared dome each axon probably supplies an exclusive subpopulation of the Merkel cells. We tested for functional collateral sprouting by eliminating one nerve to a shared dome, and at a selected time thereafter mapping the domain of the remaining axon to see whether it had enlarged. The result was the same whether the two domains initially had a region of overlap or not; no expansion of the surviving domain occurred over postoperative periods up to 4 months (an expansion of the domain by 55 micron would have been detected). Thus functional collateral sprouting had failed to occur.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Hair cell regeneration after streptomycin toxicity in the avian vestibular epithelium.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Recent reports documented the ability of the posthatch avian vestibular epithelia to produce hair cells continually at a low rate. This project was designed to investigate whether, in addition, the chicken vestibular system is capable of regenerating its sensory epithelium in response to a lesion. Aminoglycoside injections were given to young birds in order to damage the vestibular epithelium. Tritiated thymidine injections were used to label cells produced in response to the lesion. Treatment and age-matched control animals were killed at 1 day, 20 days, or 60 days after aminoglycoside injections, and vestibular organs were processed for autoradiography. Our results show that the chicken vestibular sensory epithelium is capable of regenerating hair cells after severe damage. Moreover, the epithelium is capable of complete anatomical recovery. Finally, drug damage increases the pace at which hair cells are replaced, compared to the rate of hair cell turnover in untreated tissue.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Auditory pathways of <BrainRegion>caudal telencephalon</BrainRegion> and their relation to the song system of adult male zebra finches.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Auditory information is critical for vocal imitation and other elements of social life in song birds. In zebra finches, neural centers that are necessary for the acquisition and production of learned vocalizations are known, and they all respond to acoustic stimulation. However, the circuits by which conspecific auditory signals are perceived, processed, and stored in long-term memory have not been well documented. In particular, no evidence exists of direct connections between auditory and vocal motor pathways, and two newly identified centers for auditory processing, <BrainRegion>caudomedial neostriatum</BrainRegion> (Ncm) and <BrainRegion>caudomedial hyperstriatum ventrale</BrainRegion> (cmHV), have no documented place among known auditory circuits. Our goal was to describe anatomically the auditory pathways in adult zebra finch males and, specifically, to show the projections by which <BrainRegion>Ncm</BrainRegion> and vocal motor centers may receive auditory input. By using injections of different kinds of neuroanatomical tracers (biotinylated dextran amines, rhodamine-linked dextran amines, biocytin, fluorogold, and rhodamine-linked latex beads), we have shown that, as in other avian groups, the <BrainRegion>neostriatal field L complex in caudal telencephalon</BrainRegion> is the <BrainRegion>primary forebrain</BrainRegion> relay for pathways originating in the <BrainRegion>auditory thalamus</BrainRegion>, i.e., the <BrainRegion>nucleus ovoidalis complex</BrainRegion> (Ov). In addition, <BrainRegion>Ncm</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>caudomedial hyperstriatum ventrale</BrainRegion>(cmHV) also receive input from the <BrainRegion>ovoidalis complex(Ov) complex</BrainRegion>. <BrainRegion>ovoidalis complex</BrainRegion>(Ov) has been broken down into two parts, the <BrainRegion>ovoidalis complex</BrainRegion>(Ov) &quot;core" and "shell," which project in parallel to different targets in the <BrainRegion>caudal telencephalon</BrainRegion>. Parts of the <BrainRegion>field L complex</BrainRegion> are connected among themselves and to <BrainRegion>Ncm</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>caudomedial hyperstriatum ventrale</BrainRegion>(cmHV) , and <BrainRegion>caudolateral Hv</BrainRegion> (clHV) through a complex web of largely reciprocal pathways. In addition, <BrainRegion>caudolateral Hv</BrainRegion>(clHV) and parts of the <BrainRegion>field L complex</BrainRegion> project strongly to the &quot;shelf" of <BrainRegion>neostriatum</BrainRegion> underneath the <BrainRegion>song control nucleus high vocal center</BrainRegion> (HVC) and to the &quot;cup" of <BrainRegion>archistriatum rostrodorsal</BrainRegion> to another <BrainRegion>song-control nucleus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>robust nucleus of the archistriatum</BrainRegion> (RA). We have documented two points at which the vocal motor pathway may pick up auditory signals: the <BrainRegion>high vocal center</BrainRegion>(HVC) -shelf interface and a projection from <BrainRegion>caudolateral Hv</BrainRegion>(clHV) to the <BrainRegion>nucleus interfacialis</BrainRegion> (NIf), which projects to <BrainRegion>high vocal center</BrainRegion>(HVC) . These data represent the most complete survey to date of auditory pathways in the adult male zebra finch brain, and of their projections to motor stations of the song system.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Rod bipolar array in the cat <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>: pattern of input from rods and GABA-accumulating amacrine cells.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The potential and actual connections between rod and rod bipolar arrays in the <BrainRegion>area centralis of the cat retina</BrainRegion> were studied by electron microscopy of serial ultrathin sections. In the region studied there were about 378,000 rods/mm2 and 36,000-47,000 rod bipolars/mm2. The tangential spread of rod bipolar dendrites was 11.2 microns in diameter, and the &quot;coverage factor" for the rod bipolar cell was 3.5-4.6. We estimate that about 37 rods potentially converge on a rod bipolar cell and that one rod potentially diverges to about four rod bipolar cells. The actual connections, however, are less than this by about half: 16-20 rods actually converge on a bipolar cell and one rod actually diverges to slightly less than two rod bipolar cells. The degree of convergence appears to reflect a compromise between the need to signal graded stimulus intensities (requiring wide convergence) and the need to maintain a good signal/noise ratio (requiring narrow convergence). Amacrine varicosities that provide reciprocal contact at the rod bipolar dyad were studied in serial electron microscopic autoradiograms following intraocular administration of 3H-GABA or 3H-glycine. More that 90% of the reciprocal amacrine processes accumulated GABA in a specific fashion. This information, in conjunction with Nelson's recordings from the rod bipolar and amacrine cells postsynaptic at the dyad (Nelson et al: Invest. Ophthalmol. 15:946-953, '76; Kolb and Nelson: Vision Res. 23:301-312, '83), suggests that feedback at the rod bipolar output might be positive.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Distribution and development of short-wavelength cones differ between Macaca monkey and human <BrainRegion>fovea</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Macaca monkey and humans have three cone types containing either long-wavelength (L), medium-wavelength (M), or short-wavelength (S)-specific opsin. The highest cone density is found in the <BrainRegion>fovea</BrainRegion>, which mediates high visual acuity. Most studies agree that the adult human <BrainRegion>fovea</BrainRegion> has a small S cone-free area, but data are conflicting concerning S-cone numbers in the adult Macaca monkey <BrainRegion>fovea</BrainRegion>, and little evidence exists for how either primate fovea develops its characteristic cone pattern. Single- and double-label in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry have been used to determine the pattern of <BrainRegion>foveal</BrainRegion> S cones in both the fetal and adult Macaca and human. Both labels find a clear difference at all ages between monkey and human. Adult humans have a distinct but variable central zone about 100 microm wide that lacks S cones and is surrounded by a ring in which the S-cone density is 8%. This S cone-free zone is detectable at fetal week 15.5 (Fwk15.5), shortly after S opsin is expressed, and is similar to the adult by Fwk20.5. Adult monkey <BrainRegion>foveas</BrainRegion> have an overall S-cone foveal density of 10%, with several areas lacking a few S cones that are not coincident with the area of highest cone density. A surrounding zone at 200-microm eccentricity has an S-cone density averaging 25%, but, by 800 microm, this has decreased to 11%. Fetal day 77-135 monkeys all have a distribution and density of <BrainRegion>foveal</BrainRegion> S cones similar to adults, although the high-density ring is not obvious in fetal <BrainRegion>retinas</BrainRegion>. Estimates of the numbers of S cones missing in the fetal human <BrainRegion>fovea</BrainRegion> range from 234 to 328, whereas no more than 40 are missing in the fetal monkey. These results show that, in these two trichromatic primates, S-cone distribution and the developmental mechanisms determining S-cone topography are markedly different from the time that S cones are first detected.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Distinct cell groups in the <BrainRegion>lumbosacral cord</BrainRegion> of the cat project to different areas in the <BrainRegion>periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The <BrainRegion>periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion> (PAG) is involved in aggressive and defensive behavior, micturition, and lordosis. Especially for the latter two functions, <BrainRegion>periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion>(PAG) afferents from the <BrainRegion>lumbosacral cord</BrainRegion> are of vital importance because, in addition to information regarding homeostasis and thermoregulation, they convey information from the pelvic viscera and sex organs. In the present retro- and antero-grade tracing study, the projection patterns of different <BrainRegion>lumbosacral</BrainRegion> cell groups in the <BrainRegion>periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion>(PAG) were determined. In the retrograde study, wheatgerm agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) injections were made in the <BrainRegion>periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion>(PAG) and/or adjacent <BrainRegion>tegmentum</BrainRegion>, and in the anterograde study, wheatgerm agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase(WGA-HRP) was injected in different <BrainRegion>lumbosacral segments</BrainRegion>. The results revealed that <BrainRegion>lumbosacral- periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion>(PAG) neurons could be divided into three groups. The first and largest group was present in <BrainRegion>lumbar 7</BrainRegion>-<BrainRegion>sacral 3 segments</BrainRegion> (L7-S3) and consisted of small, oval, and fusiform neurons. It extended from the dorsolateral part of lamina I in <BrainRegion>L7</BrainRegion>, along the lateral part of the <BrainRegion>dorsal horn in S1</BrainRegion>, and into lamina V of <BrainRegion>S2</BrainRegion>. In the <BrainRegion>lateral part of S2</BrainRegion>, some of its neurons formed clusters with intervals of +/- 230 microns. The location of the first group overlapped extensively with the termination area of pelvic and pudendal afferents. The main <BrainRegion>midbrain</BrainRegion> target of the first group was the <BrainRegion>medial part of the lateral periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion>(PAG) . The second group consisted of small to large multipolar neurons in laminae VIII and medial VII of caudal L6, L7, and rostral <BrainRegion>S1</BrainRegion>. This group projected strongly to a distinct region in the <BrainRegion>lateral part of the lateral periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion>(PAG) and the laterally adjacent <BrainRegion>tegmentum</BrainRegion>. About 10% of the labeled neurons did not fit in the two groups. They were evenly distributed throughout lumbar 4-coccygeal 3 segments (L4-Co3) and consisted of large multipolar lamina V neurons and small lamina I neurons that projected diffusely to the <BrainRegion>lateral and dorsal periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion>(PAG) . The large lamina V neurons also targeted the laterally adjacent <BrainRegion>tegmentum</BrainRegion>.

<ArticleTitle>Oscillatory calcium responses mediated by P2Y2 purinergic receptors in terminal Schwann cells of longitudinal lanceolate endings isolated from rat vibrissae.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The longitudinal lanceolate endings are mechanoreceptors that detect hair movement. We have previously shown that terminal Schwann cells, glial elements of the sensory devices, respond to an application of the sensory modulator adenosine 5&apos;-triphosphate (ATP) by an elevation in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), suggesting a regulatory role for these cells in the cutaneous sensation. To define the spatiotemporal dynamics of the cell signaling and the pharmacological properties of the receptors responsible, arrays of the lanceolates were enzymatically isolated from the rat vibrissal follicle and subjected to [Ca2+]i image recording by time-lapse confocal microscopy during bath application of 5'-triphosphate(ATP) analogues. The terminal Schwann cells formed extensive networks, connecting with one another by their lamellar processes associated with lanceolate axon endings. Stimulation of the cells with 100 microM 5'-triphosphate(ATP) evoked [Ca2+]i waves propagating along the cell processes. In each Schwann lamella, the initial wave evoked by a given trial of the stimulant arose from a specific locus within the cell process, whereas subsequent waves were sometimes observed to travel from its proximal portion. This implies a subcellular compartmentalization that may enable each Schwann lamella to modulate the activity of its accompanying lanceolate terminal through its own Ca2+ signal as well as to regulate neighboring lanceolates through interlamellar signal propagation. Pharmacological experiments have shown that the Schwann cell responses are mediated by the P2Y2 receptor, which has recently been reported to couple to multiple effector molecules in addition to stimulating the phosphoinositide signaling pathway involved in various glia-neuron interactions.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Phenotypic conversion of distinct muscle fiber populations to electrocytes in a weakly electric fish.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>In most groups of electric fish, the electric organ (EO) derives from striated muscle cells that suppress many muscle phenotypic properties. This phenotypic conversion is recapitulated during regeneration of the tail in the weakly electric fish Sternopygus macrurus. Mature electrocytes, the cells of the electric organ, are considerably larger than the muscle fibers from which they derive, and it is not known whether this is a result of muscle fiber hypertrophy and/or fiber fusion. In this study, electron micrographs revealed fusion of differentiated muscle fibers during the formation of electrocytes. There was no evidence of hypertrophy of muscle fibers during their phenotypic conversion. Furthermore, although fish possess distinct muscle phenotypes, the extent to which each fiber population contributes to the formation of the electric organ(EO) has not been determined. By using myosin ATPase histochemistry and anti-myosin heavy chain (MHC) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), different fiber types were identified in fascicles of muscle in the adult tail. Mature electrocytes were not stained by the ATPase reaction, nor were they labeled by any of the anti- anti-myosin heavy chain(MHC) monoclonal antibodies(mAbs) . In contrast, mature muscle fibers exhibited four staining patterns. The four fiber types were spatially arranged in distinct compartments with little intermixing; peripherally were two populations of type I fibers with small cross-sectional areas, whereas more centrally were two populations of type II fibers with larger cross-sectional areas. In 2- and 3-week regenerating blastema, three fiber types were clearly discerned. Most (&amp;gt; 95%) early-forming electrocytes had an anti-myosin heavy chain(MHC) phenotype similar to that of type II fibers. In contrast, fusion among type I fibers was rare. Together, ultrastructural and immunohistochemical analyses revealed that the fusion of muscle fibers gives rise to electrocytes and that this fusion occurs primarily among the population of type II fibers in regenerating blastema.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Denervation study of synapses of <BrainRegion>organ of Corti</BrainRegion> of old world monkeys.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Fine structural characteristics of synapses in the <BrainRegion>spiral organ of Corti</BrainRegion> were examined, with reference to differences between inner and outer hair-cell systems, and to location of neurons of origin of efferent axons. Surgical interruption of crossed <BrainRegion>olivocochlear bundle</BrainRegion>, of <BrainRegion>vestibular nerve</BrainRegion>, of <BrainRegion>facial nerve</BrainRegion>, and excision of <BrainRegion>superior cervical ganglia</BrainRegion> were used to determine the pathways of different axons. Interruption of the <BrainRegion>vestibular nerve</BrainRegion> near the <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion> results in degeneration of all efferent terminals on outer hair cells. Mid-line lesions at, and caudal to, the <BrainRegion>facial colliculus</BrainRegion> result in degeneration of about half of these efferent terminals. Efferent synaptic bulbs to the inner hair-cell system are small, of the order of one micron, and form type 2 junctions with afferent dendrites. They tend to have more large dense-core vesicles (about 80 nm) than the large efferent terminals of the outer hair-cell system, and appear to be the terminals of axons in the <BrainRegion>habenula perforata</BrainRegion>, which exhibit varicosities laden with large dense core vesicles. The varicosities are unaffected by excision of the <BrainRegion>superior cervical ganglia</BrainRegion>. So far as our material can reveal, it appears that the varicosities in the <BrainRegion>habenula perforata</BrainRegion> do not survive vestibular root interruption, nor do the efferent processes in the internal spiral bundle or at the base of inner hair cells. Most interestingly, the afferent processes of the inner hair-cell system, as identified for example by their relation to pre-synaptic bodies in the inner hair cells, are subject to a trans-synaptic reaction after severance of the vestibular root. They undergo a dramatic cytological transformation, characterized by increase of volume, engorgement with microtubules, microfilaments, microvesicles of various sizes, and clusters of lysosomes. Thus, both the efferent and afferent terminals of the inner hair-cell system show marked cytological differences from the corresponding terminals of the outer hair cell system.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Down-regulation of trkA mRNA within <BrainRegion>nucleus basalis</BrainRegion> neurons in individuals with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer&apos;s disease.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Recent studies indicate that trkA expression is reduced in end-stage Alzheimer&apos;s disease (AD). However, understanding the neuropathologic correlates of early cognitive decline, as well as the changes that underlie the transition from nondemented mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's disease(AD) , are more critical neurobiological challenges. In these regards, the present study examined the expression of trkA mRNA in individuals diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment(MCI) and Alzheimer's disease(AD) from a cohort of people enrolled in a Religious Orders Study. Individuals with mild cognitive impairment(MCI) and Alzheimer's disease(AD) displayed significant reductions in trkA mRNA relative to aged-matched controls, indicating that alterations in trkA gene expression occur early in the disease process. The magnitude of change was similar in mild cognitive impairment(MCI) and Alzheimer's disease(AD) cases, suggesting that further loss of trkA mRNA is not necessarily associated with the transition of individuals from nondemented mild cognitive impairment(MCI) to Alzheimer's disease(AD) . The loss of trkA mRNA was not associated with education, apolipoprotein E allele status, gender, Braak score, global cognitive score or Mini-Mental Status Examination. In contrast, the loss of trkA mRNA in mild cognitive impairment(MCI) and Alzheimer's disease(AD) was significantly correlated with function on a variety of episodic memory tests.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>GABA-like immunoreactivity in a population of locust intersegmental interneurones and their inputs.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Intracellular labelling of locust intersegmental interneurones with lucifer yellow or horseradish peroxidase was carried out in combination with light and electron microscope immunocytochemistry by using an antibody raised against gamma amino butyric acid (GABA). Fifteen percent (four out of 27) of intracellularly stained interneurones showed gamma amino butyric acid(GABA) -like immunoreactivity. This is in agreement with previous physiological observations that 20% of the interneurones in this population make inhibitory output connections in the metathoracic ganglion. gamma amino butyric acid(GABA) -like immunoreactivity was also found in processes presynaptic to the interneurones in the mesothoracic ganglion. The presence of such immunoreactive inputs onto the intersegmental interneurones correlates well with physiological evidence that their receptive fields are in part shaped by direct input from gamma amino butyric acid(GABA) -ergic spiking local interneurones.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>The ultrastructure and synaptic connections of the spinal terminations from single, physiologically characterized axons descending in the <BrainRegion>dorsolateral funiculus</BrainRegion> from the midline, <BrainRegion>pontomedullary region</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Single axons descending in the <BrainRegion>spinal, dorsolateral funiculus</BrainRegion> which were directly activated by stimulating in or near <BrainRegion>nucleus raphe magnus</BrainRegion> (nRM) in the <BrainRegion>rostral medulla</BrainRegion> were iontophoretically injected with horseradish peroxidase (HRP). Labeled axons and terminal arborizations in the spinal cord were demonstrated by diaminobenzidine histochemistry following fixation. Sections were processed for electron microscopy and embedded between coverslips. Following examination with the light microscope, selected boutons were sectioned in ultrathin series and examined with the electron microscope. Two arborization patterns were observed with the light microscope. One terminated dorsally in laminae I, II, V, and X, while the other terminated ventrally in laminae V, VII, and X. At the ultrastructural level, boutons predominantly contacted dendrites and occasionally contacted cell somas. Ventrally projecting axons had boutons characterizable as Gray&apos;s type I. Some dorsally projecting axons also had Gray's type I boutons, while other axons had Gray's type II boutons. Thus, these descending axons may be heterogeneous in function. No differences in physiological characteristics were found between axons with Gray's type I boutons versus axons with Gray's type II boutons.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>A quantitative analysis of changes in the olfactory epithelium following bulbectomy in hamster.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Continuous replacement of sensory neurons is a normal process in the olfactory system of adult vertebrates. The capacity for replacement following experimentally induced degeneration of sensory neurons makes this system ideal for the study of the dynamics of neural populations. A quantitative analysis was made to determine the time course and degree of cell replacement in the olfactory epithelium following unilateral bulbectomy in adult hamsters. Histological measurements of number of cells and epithelial thickness were made for up to 194 days postoperatively. Results for each experimental animal were expressed as a percentage of the contralateral control side. There was an immediate degeneration of cells, the number decreasing to 39% by day 4. During days 4--15 new growth resulted in an increase in cell number, which was maintained at a level of 60--70% through day 194. Epithelial thickness decreased to 60--70% during the degeneration period, but there was no recovery during subsequent days 4--194. Analysis of epithelial cells by cell type (supporting, receptor, and basal cells) showed that changes in cell numbers were limited to the neural cell populations (receptor and basal). This study confirms that olfactory sensory neurons are capable of replacement following degeneration in spite of the absence of normal target tissue. However, the observed recovery does not reach control levels and the functional capacity of replacement neurons requires further study.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<AbstractText>The total number of neurons within six subdivisions of the rat <BrainRegion>basal ganglia</BrainRegion> was estimated using unbiased stereological counting methods and systematic random sampling techniques. Six young adult rats were perfuse-fixed, their <BrainRegion>right cerebral hemispheres</BrainRegion> were embedded in glycolmethacrylate, and a complete set of serial 40-mu m sections was cut through each hemisphere. After a random start, a systematic subset (e.g., every tenth) of these sections was used to estimate the total volume of each subdivision using Cavalieri&apos;s method. The same set of sampled sections was used to estimate the number of neurons in a known subvolume (i.e., the Nv) by the optical d in a known subvolume(i.e.) tor method. The product of the total volume and the Nv by these methods yields an unbiased estimate of the total number of neurons. It was found that the <BrainRegion>right basal ganglia</BrainRegion> consisted, on average, of 2.79 million <BrainRegion>neostriatal</BrainRegion> or <BrainRegion>caudate-putamen</BrainRegion> neurons (with a coefficient of variation of 0.07), 46,000 <BrainRegion>external globus pallidus</BrainRegion> neurons (0.11), 3,200 <BrainRegion>entopeduncular/internal globus pallidus</BrainRegion> neurons (0.10), 13,600 <BrainRegion>subthalamic</BrainRegion> neurons (0.10), 7,200 <BrainRegion>substantial nigra pars compacta</BrainRegion> neurons (0.15), and 26,300 <BrainRegion>substantia nigra pars reticulata</BrainRegion> neurons (0.07).</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR5 subcellular distribution and developmental expression in <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR5 is a G-protein coupled receptor that plays a key role in release of Ca2+ from internal stores via inositol triphosphate mobilization. Western and Northern blot analyses revealed a greatly enhanced expression of mGluR5 in rats during early stages of <BrainRegion>hypothalamic</BrainRegion> development compared with the adult. This enhanced developmental expression provides an explanation for the dramatic physiological response of developing neurons to metabotropic glutamate receptor activation and supports the argument that metabotropic glutamate receptors may play an important role in <BrainRegion>hypothalamic</BrainRegion> development. During development, expression of the mGluR5 gene was reduced, not only in the <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion> but also in other regions of the brain. A differential decrease in mGluR5 protein was found in different brain regions with Western blot analysis. The <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion> showed a sixfold decrease in mGluR5 with development, whereas the <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion> showed only a threefold decrease. Immunocytochemistry with an affinity-purified antibody against a peptide deduced from the cloned mGluR5 gene revealed selective expression in some regions in the adult <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion>. In the adult and developing (postnatal day 10) brain, immunoreactive neurons were found in the <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>preoptic area</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>lateral hypothalamus</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>mammillary region</BrainRegion>, areas where the related metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR1 is also found. In contrast, the <BrainRegion>ventromedial nucleus</BrainRegion>, an area critically involved in the regulation of food intake and metabolic balances, showed strong mGluR5 immunoreactivity but no mGluR1 immunoreactivity. Little or no mGluR5 staining was found in the neurosecretory neurons of the <BrainRegion>paraventricular</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>supraoptic</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>arcuate nuclei</BrainRegion>. Ultrastructurally, mGluR5 was associated with the cytoplasmic face of the plasmalemma on <BrainRegion>hypothalamic</BrainRegion> dendrites, dendritic spines, and neuronal perikarya in the adult. The strongest immunoreactivity was found in patches on the membrane, sometimes associated with the postsynaptic side of synapses and sometimes associated with nonsynaptic dendritic or perikaryal membrane. Intense immunostaining was found on some astrocyte processes surrounding synaptic complexes containing asymmetrical synapses. These astrocytes would be in an ideal position to receive excitatory signals from glutamatergic axons. Unlike the punctate appearance of immunolabeling on neuronal membranes, astrocytes showed continuous staining along the plasma membrane.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Immunohistochemical localization of GAD67-expressing neurons and processes in the rat <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion>: subregional distribution in the <BrainRegion>nucleus tractus solitarius</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The role of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in homeostatic control in the <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion>, in particular, in the <BrainRegion>nucleus tractus solitarius</BrainRegion> (NTS), is well established. However, to date, there is no detailed description of the distribution of gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) ergic neurons within the <BrainRegion>nucleus tractus solitarius</BrainRegion>(NTS) . The goal of the current study was to reexamine the efficacy of immunohistochemical localization of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) protein, specifically the 67-kDa isoform ( glutamic acid decarboxylase(GAD) 67), as a marker for gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) ergic neurons in the <BrainRegion>medulla</BrainRegion> and to provide a detailed map of glutamic acid decarboxylase(GAD) 67-immunoreactive (-ir) cells within rat <BrainRegion>nucleus tractus solitarius</BrainRegion>(NTS) by using a recently developed mouse monoclonal antibody. We describe a distribution of glutamic acid decarboxylase(GAD) 67-ir cells in the <BrainRegion>medulla</BrainRegion> similar to that reported previously from in situ hybridization study. glutamic acid decarboxylase(GAD) 67-ir cells were localized in regions known to contain high gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) content, including the <BrainRegion>ventrolateral medulla</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>raphe nuclei</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>area postrema</BrainRegion>, but were absent from all motor nuclei, although dense terminal labeling was discerned in these regions. In the <BrainRegion>nucleus tractus solitarius</BrainRegion>(NTS) , glutamic acid decarboxylase(GAD) 67-ir was localized in all subregions. Semiquantitative analysis of the glutamic acid decarboxylase(GAD) 67-ir distribution in the <BrainRegion>nucleus tractus solitarius</BrainRegion>(NTS) revealed greater numbers of glutamic acid decarboxylase(GAD) 67-ir cells medial to the solitary tract. Finally, dense glutamic acid decarboxylase(GAD) 67 terminal labeling was found in the <BrainRegion>medial, central, intermediate, commissural, and subpostremal subregions</BrainRegion>, whereas sparse labeling was observed in the ventral subregion. Our findings support the use of immunohistochemistry for glutamic acid decarboxylase(GAD) 67 as a marker for the localization of gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) ergic cells and terminal processes in the rat <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion>. Furthermore, the reported heterogeneous distribution of glutamic acid decarboxylase(GAD) 67-ir in the <BrainRegion>nucleus tractus solitarius</BrainRegion>(NTS) suggests differential inhibitory modulation of sensory processing.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Cerebellar Purkinje cells from the lurcher mutant and wild-type mouse grown in vitro: a light and electron microscope study.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Lurcher is an autosomal semidominant murine mutation. Lurcher heterozygotes (+/Lc) lose all their <BrainRegion>cerebellar</BrainRegion> Purkinje cells by adulthood. Explants from 2 days postnatal (P2) wild-type (+/+) and +/Lc <BrainRegion>cerebellar cortex</BrainRegion> were grown in vitro to investigate the role of local neuronal environment and afferent input on the degenerating +/Lc Purkinje cell. In Lurcher explants, Purkinje cells were maintained for up to 25 days in vitro. No significant difference was observed between +/+ and +/Lc Purkinje cell numbers from 10 to 20 days in vitro, as revealed by calbindin-D immunoreactivity. Growing +/Lc explants in association with +/+ explants resulted in no significant difference in Purkinje cell survival (10-20 days in vitro). Image analysis of the gross morphology of calbindin-D-immunostained Purkinje cells from +/+ and +/Lc explants grown in vitro revealed a significant decrease in the total area and dendritic lengths of +/Lc Purkinje cells (15 and 20 days in vitro). The fine structure of +/Lc and +/+ Purkinje cells was examined under the electron microscope (10-25 days in vitro). No difference in ultrastructure was observed between +/Lc and +/+ Purkinje cells grown in vitro, and many features similar to normal Purkinje cell development in vivo were present. These included monosynaptic parallel fibre synapses with Purkinje cell dendritic spines, other interneuron synapses with Purkinje cell dendrites and soma, astroglial investment, and minimal extracellular space in the neuropil. Unusual features observed included a persistence of the perisomatic spines in some Purkinje cells, an absence of Nissl bodies in the Purkinje cell perikaryon, naked Purkinje cell dendritic spines, and occasional heterologous synapses. The results are discussed in the light of previous chimeric analysis of the Lurcher mutation, and a hypothesis is put forward to explain the survival of +/Lc Purkinje cells in vitro.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>The single neurofilament subunit of lamprey may need another element for filament assembly.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Regenerating axon tips in transected lamprey <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> contain dense accumulations of neurofilaments (NFs), suggesting that neurofilaments(NFs) may play a role in the mechanism of axonal regeneration. Compared with heteropolymeric assemblies of NF triplet proteins in mammals, NF in lampreys has been thought to contain only a single subunit (NF180). This would imply that NF180 self-assembles, which would be important for manipulating its expression in studies of axonal regeneration. In order to study the possible role of NF in process outgrowth and to determine whether NF180 can self-assemble, its gene was transfected into mammalian and fish cell lines that either contain or lack vimentin. In transfected NIH3T3 cells, NF180 was poorly phosphorylated and its expression did not alter the length or number of cell processes. Nor did it appear to form typical intermediate filaments, suggesting that it may not self-assemble. NF180 also did not form typical filaments in SW13cl cells that either possessed or lacked vimentin, nor in transfected fish cells that were cultured at 18 degrees C. In vitro, NF180 could not self-assemble but interacted with NF-L to interrupt its self-assembly. When cotransfected with rat NF-L into SW13c1.2vim(-) cells, NF180 did form thick, rod-like filamentous structures on immunofluorescence. More typical neurofilaments(NFs) were observed when NF180 was cotransfected with both NF-L and NF-M. Thus, NF180 cannot self-assemble but appears to require one or more additional elements for incorporation into neurofilaments(NFs) .</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Peripheral and central predictors of whisker afferent morphology in the rat <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Prior studies suggest that whisker afferents have but one central projection pattern, despite their association with differing peripheral receptors that predict central morphology in other systems. Target factors in barrelettes are thought to dictate afferent projection patterns; yet, barrelettes differ in their size, shape and development. We tested the hypothesis that whisker afferents have differing morphologies that are predicted by peripheral and central factors. Branching patterns and collaterals of 78 Neurobiotin-stained afferents were compared in rats. Fibers from one whisker had precisely somatotopic projections but highly varied morphologies. For the entire sample, analysis of variance revealed significant intrafiber variance in collateral number and arbor shape that was attributed to the target subnucleus. Significant interfiber variance did not reflect response adaptation rate, direction sensitivity, whisker row origin or parent fiber bifurcation in the trigeminal root. Instead, we found the following. 1) Mandibular fibers had more elongated arbors than maxillary axons. In subnuclei interpolaris and principalis, mandibular fibers had larger arbors with more boutons/collateral than maxillary axons; in oralis and interpolaris, mandibular fibers had fewer collaterals than those of the maxillary division. 2) Upper lip whisker axons had more boutons than those from the B-D row in all subnuclei. 3) Rostral whisker are afferents had larger arbors and more boutons than those from middle or caudal arcs due to significant arc effects in interpolaris and oralis. Thus, whisker afferents are not structurally uniform, and some morphological features are predictable. Intrafiber variance is attributed to the central target; interfiber variance reflects maxillary versus mandibular origin, upper lip origin and whisker rostrocaudal arc.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>From embryo to adult: anatomy and development of a leg sensory organ in Phormia regina Meigen (Insecta: Diptera). I. Anatomy and physiology of a larval &quot;leg" sensory organ.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Neurons within the precursor of the adult leg, the imaginal disc, innervate a larval sense organ, Keilin&apos;s organ. Electron microscopical investigations of first instar larvae show that five dendrites end at the organ: three insert at the bases of the three hairs of the organ and two end against the cuticle, without any apparent cuticular specialization. In third instar larvae, the imaginal leg discs invaginate into the body cavity, and only four of the dendrites (the outer segments of which become greatly elongated) remain in contact with Keilin's organ. The axons of the neurons that supply Keilin's organ project into a ventral neuropile region of the central nervous system, with a pattern that resembles the projections of other larval sensilla. Electrical activity can be recorded from neurons of the imaginal disc in response to mechanical stimulation.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Oculomotor control in calliphorid flies: head movements during activation and inhibition of neck motor neurons corroborate neuroanatomical predictions.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>In tethered flying flies, moving contrast gratings or small spots elicit head movements which are suited to track <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> images moving at velocities up to 3,000 degrees/sec (about 50 Hz contrast frequency for gratings of spatial wavelength 15 degrees). To investigate the neural basis of these movements we have combined videomicroscopy with electrophysiological stimulation and recording to demonstrate that excitation of prothoracic motor neurons projecting in the anterodorsal (ADN) and frontal nerves (FN), respectively, generates the yaw and roll head movements measured behaviorally. Electrical stimulation of the ADN produces head yaw. The visual stimuli which excite the two ADN motor neurons (ADN MNs) are horizontal motion of gratings or spots moving clockwise around the yaw axis in the case of the right ADN (counterclockwise for left ADN). Activity is inhibited by motion in the opposite direction. Spatial sensitivity varies in the yaw plane with a maximum between 0 degree and 40 degrees ipsilaterally, but both excitation and inhibition are elicited out to 80 degrees in the ipsilateral and contralateral fields. ADN motor neurons(ADN MNs) respond to contrast frequencies up to 15-20 Hz, with a peak around 2-4 Hz for grating motion in the excitatory or inhibitory directions. Electrical stimulation of the frontal nerves(FN) primarily elicits roll down to the ipsilateral side. The one frontal nerves(FN) MN consistently driven by visual stimulation is excited by downward motion and inhibited by upward motion at 80 degrees azimuth in the ipsilateral visual field. At -80 degrees contralateral, visual motion has the opposite effect: Upward is excitatory and downward is inhibitory. The frontal nerves(FN) MN is tuned to contrast frequencies in the same range as the ADN motor neurons(ADN MNs) , with peak sensitivity around 4 Hz. The functional organization of inputs to the ADN and frontal nerves(FN) is discussed with respect to identified visual interneurons and parallel pathways controlling motor output.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Geometry of rubrospinal, rubroolivary, and local circuit neurons in the macaque <BrainRegion>red nucleus</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The primate <BrainRegion>red nucleus</BrainRegion> consists of three main neuron subpopulations, namely, rubrospinal neurons in the <BrainRegion>magnocellular nucleus</BrainRegion>, rubroolivary cells in the <BrainRegion>parvocellular nucleus</BrainRegion>, and local circuit neurons in both subnuclei: Each subpopulation has unique <BrainRegion>cerebellar</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>neocortical</BrainRegion> inputs. The structural framework for the interactions of these rubral subpopulations remains poorly defined and was the focus of this study in six macaques. Somata of rubrospinal neurons, dorsolateral-spinal (DL-spinal) neurons, as defined in the accompanying paper (Burman et al. [2000] J. Comp. Neurol., this issue), and rubroolivary neurons were labeled retrogradely first with Fast Blue injected either into the <BrainRegion>cervical spinal cord</BrainRegion> or the <BrainRegion>inferior olive</BrainRegion>. The soma/dendrite profiles of selected cells (53 rubrospinal, 19 dorsolateral-spinal(DL-spinal) , and 17 rubroolivary cells) were visualized by the intracellular injection of Lucifer Yellow/biocytin in fixed slices (400 microm thick) of <BrainRegion>midbrain</BrainRegion>. The descriptive statistics of the somata and the dendritic arborization of each rubral neuron type were established. Projection neuron subpopulations had similar but differentiable soma/dendrite profiles, with four to six slender, spine-bearing dendritic trees radiating out approximately 400 microm from the soma. Twelve presumed interneurons, all in the <BrainRegion>parvocellular nucleus</BrainRegion>, differed from projection neurons in that they had smaller somata and many slender, spine-bearing segments that constituted the multibranching dendrite profile that radiated out approximately 250 microm from the soma. A tentative model of the macaque rubral microcircuitry was developed, and its functional implications were explored. It incorporated 1) the known topography of the nucleus and its connections, 2) our data specifying the soma/dendrite morphology of the three main rubral neuron types, and 3) the ultrastructure reported by other laboratories of intrarubral synaptic connections.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Compartmental and topographical distributions of axons in nerves to the amphibian (Bufo marinus) glutaeus muscle.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The present work seeks to determine if axons to an amphibian muscle are segregated in nerve trunks between the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> and muscle according to their primary nerve destination or their topographical projection in the muscle. The distribution of axons to different compartments and subcompartments of the amphibian (Bufo marinus) glutaeus muscle has been determined in transverse sections of <BrainRegion>spinal</BrainRegion> and limb nerves after retrogradely labelling the axons with horseradish peroxidase. Glutaeus axons were dispersed widely through <BrainRegion>spinal nerves 8 and 9</BrainRegion> but loosely gathered together in one quadrant of the sciatic nerve after passing through the <BrainRegion>lumbar plexus</BrainRegion>. Glutaeus axons became tightly clustered to the exclusion of other axons along the length of the triceps femoris nerve after it divides from the sciatic nerve. Furthermore, axons destined for one of the two glutaeus primary nerve branches segregate from those of the other branch at the level of the triceps femoris nerve before the glutaeus nerve forms. On the other hand, motoneurones that subserve a primary branch are not segregated, but are found throughout the rostrocaudal extent of the glutaeus motoneurone pool. Injection of horseradish peroxidase under the epimysium of either the ventral or the dorsal surfaces of the glutaeus muscle labelled motoneurones preferentially in either the rostral or caudal part of the motoneurone pool, respectively. This confirms studies that have shown a topographical projection from the spinal motoneurone pool onto the glutaeus muscle. However, there was no segregation of dorsally projecting axons in the glutaeus and primary nerve branches. Thus, glutaeus axons segregate according to their muscle compartmental projections well before entering the muscle, but they show no organization in nerves with respect to their topographical projections within a compartment.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

Correlative distribution of catecholamine varicosities and magnocellular neurosecretory neurons in the rat <BrainRegion>supraoptic</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>paraventricular nuclei</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The comparative morphology of catecholamine (CA) varicosities and neurophysin (NP)-containing perikarya of the <BrainRegion>supraoptic</BrainRegion> (SON) and <BrainRegion>paraventricular nuclei</BrainRegion> (PVN) was examined. The major catecholamine(CA) innervation to the <BrainRegion>SON</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>paraventricular nuclei</BrainRegion>(PVN) did not coexist with the major distribution of magnocellular perikarya, but was located peripheral to the nuclei. A dense distribution of catecholamine(CA) varicosities was found ventral to the neurosecretory perikarya of the <BrainRegion>SON</BrainRegion> and overlapped numerous immunoreactive oxytocin- and vasopressin-containing neuritic profiles. Examination of Golgi-stained sections revealed that dendrites from <BrainRegion>SON</BrainRegion> perikarya projected to the catecholamine(CA) zone and were likely candidates for the processes identified immunocytochemically. In addition, a heterogenous distribution of axosomatic contacts was found within the <BrainRegion>SON</BrainRegion> which suggested a preferential innervation of VP-containing neurons. The densest concentration of catecholamine(CA) varicosities in the <BrainRegion>paraventricular nuclei</BrainRegion>(PVN) occurred in the <BrainRegion>periventricular region</BrainRegion> adjacent to the <BrainRegion>third ventricle</BrainRegion> and in the contiguous parvocellular portion of the <BrainRegion>paraventricular nuclei</BrainRegion>(PVN) . These catecholamine(CA) varicosities overlapped scattered oxytocinerigic perikarya in both areas. In addition the <BrainRegion>ventromedial as well as the dorsolateral subnuclei of the paraventricular nuclei</BrainRegion>(PVN) were contacted by catecholamine(CA) varicosities; this heterogeneous distribution suggests that the each <BrainRegion>subnucleus of the paraventricular nuclei</BrainRegion>(PVN) with its individual <BrainRegion>hypothalamic</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>neurohypophyseal</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion>, or <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> projections may possibly receive a catecholaminergic innervation by a select group of catecholamine(CA) cells or nuclear groups from the <BrainRegion>brain stem</BrainRegion>.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Functional mapping of the rat <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> using diverse odorants reveals modular responses to functional groups and hydrocarbon structural features.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>In an effort to understand the olfactory code of rats, we collected more than 1,500,000 measurements of glomerular activity in response to 54 odorants selected to provide differences in functional groups and hydrocarbon structure. Each odorant evoked a unique response pattern by differentially stimulating clusters of glomeruli, called modules. Odorants sharing specific aspects of their structure activated the same modules, allowing us to relate responses to structure across approximately 80% of the glomerular layer. The most obvious relationship was between the presence of particular oxygen-containing functional groups and the activity of glomeruli within dorsal modules. Functional group-specific responses were observed for odorants possessing a wide range of hydrocarbon structure, including aliphatic, cyclic, and aromatic features. Even formic acid and acetone, the simplest odorants possessing acid or ketone functional groups, respectively, stimulated modules specific for these functional groups. At the same time, quantitative analysis of pattern similarities revealed relationships in activation patterns between odorants of similar hydrocarbon structure. The odorant responses were reliable enough to allow us to predict accurately specific aspects of odorant molecular structure from the evoked glomerular activity pattern, as well as predicting the location of glomerular activity evoked by novel odorants.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>The thalamo-cortical projection of the <BrainRegion>nucleus submedius</BrainRegion> in the cat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> projection of the <BrainRegion>nucleus submedius</BrainRegion> (Sm) was studied in the cat with the autoradiographic and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) methods. The results indicate that <BrainRegion>Smv</BrainRegion>(Sm) projects topographically on to layer 3 of a distinct agranular <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> field that occupies the <BrainRegion>posterolateral gyrus proreus</BrainRegion>, the adjacent <BrainRegion>fundus of the rhinal sulcus</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>postero-ventral portion of the medial wall of the presylvian sulcus</BrainRegion>. This <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> field is denoted the <BrainRegion>ventrolateral orbital cortex</BrainRegion> (VLO), consonant with previous nomenclature in the rat (Krettek and Price, &apos;77a). The more ventral part ( <BrainRegion>ventrolateral orbital cortex</BrainRegion>(VLO) beta) is cytoarchitectonically distinct from the dorsal part ( <BrainRegion>ventrolateral orbital cortex</BrainRegion>(VLO) alpha); the former receives input from the <BrainRegion>anterior part of Smv</BrainRegion>(Sm) ( Smv(Sm) a), while the latter receives input from the <BrainRegion>dorsal and ventral parts of Smv</BrainRegion>(Sm) ( Smv(Sm) d and Smv(Sm) v). A light input to superficial layer 1 of <BrainRegion>ventrolateral orbital cortex</BrainRegion>(VLO) probably also arises from <BrainRegion>Smv</BrainRegion>(Sm) , and there may be an input to layers 5 and 6. The corticothalamic projection from <BrainRegion>ventrolateral orbital cortex</BrainRegion>(VLO) to <BrainRegion>Smv</BrainRegion>(Sm) reciprocates the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral thalamocortical</BrainRegion> projection and also has a moderate contralateral component. A dense, subpial layer 1 input to <BrainRegion>ventrolateral orbital cortex</BrainRegion>(VLO) arises from cells of the <BrainRegion>ventromedial nucleus</BrainRegion> (VM) subjacent to <BrainRegion>Smv</BrainRegion>(Sm) . The present experiments also indicate that clusters of cells in <BrainRegion>ventromedial nucleus</BrainRegion>(VM) probably provide input to layer 3 of the <BrainRegion>cortex in the fundus of the presylvian sulcus</BrainRegion>, as well as area 6a beta in the <BrainRegion>lateral wall of the presylvian sulcus</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>ventral bank of the cruciate sulcus</BrainRegion>. Results from the horseradish peroxidase(HRP) experiments additionally indicate that <BrainRegion>ventrolateral orbital cortex</BrainRegion>(VLO) beta and the <BrainRegion>anteroventral ( Smv(Sm) v) portion of ventrolateral orbital cortex</BrainRegion>(VLO) alpha are reciprocally connected with the <BrainRegion>ventral agranular insular cortex</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>cingulate cortex</BrainRegion>, ipsilaterally, while the <BrainRegion>posterodorsal ( Smv(Sm) d) portion of ventrolateral orbital cortex</BrainRegion>(VLO) alpha is instead connected wih specific <BrainRegion>portions of the somatosensory cortical areas</BrainRegion> bilaterally. All portions of <BrainRegion>ventrolateral orbital cortex</BrainRegion>(VLO) alpha appear to project to the <BrainRegion>ventrolateral periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion>. In light of the recent suggestion that <BrainRegion>Smv</BrainRegion>(Sm) d is involved with nociception (Craig and Burton, &apos;81), the present results suggest that the related portion of <BrainRegion>ventrolateral orbital cortex</BrainRegion>(VLO) alpha may serve as a <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> representation for noxious stimuli.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>The organization of the efferent projections from the <BrainRegion>pontine parabrachial area</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>amygdaloid complex</BrainRegion>: a Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) study in the rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The organization of the efferent projections from the <BrainRegion>pontine parabrachial</BrainRegion> (pPB) area to the <BrainRegion>amygdala</BrainRegion> has been studied in the rat by using microinjections of Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PHA-L), a sensitive and selective anterograde axonal marker, into restricted subregions of the <BrainRegion>pontine parabrachial</BrainRegion>(pPB) area. The results confirmed that the <BrainRegion>pontine parabrachial</BrainRegion>(pPB) area primarily projected onto the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral nucleus centralis of the amygdala</BrainRegion> (Ce), and to a lesser extent onto the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral posterior basolateral (BLP), anterior basomedial (BMA), and amygdaloid cortical (ACo) nuclei of the amygdala</BrainRegion>. Substantial projections were also found in the <BrainRegion>substantia innominata dorsal/ventral portion of the globus pallidus</BrainRegion> (SId/GPv), <BrainRegion>substriatal</BrainRegion> (SStr), and <BrainRegion>fondus striata</BrainRegion>l (FStr) regions which continue the <BrainRegion>amygdala</BrainRegion> rostrally. The results demonstrated that the projections of the <BrainRegion>pontine parabrachial</BrainRegion>(pPB) area onto the <BrainRegion>centralis of the amygdala</BrainRegion>(Ce) were topically organized: 1) The region of the <BrainRegion>pontine parabrachial</BrainRegion>(pPB) area mainly including the <BrainRegion>medial subnucleus</BrainRegion> ( pontine parabrachial(pPB) m), the waist area ( <BrainRegion>pontine parabrachial(pPB) wa</BrainRegion>), and a thin rostral lamina of the <BrainRegion>ventral lateral subnucleus</BrainRegion> ( pontine parabrachial(pPB) vl) projects primarily to the <BrainRegion>medial portion of the centralis of the amygdala</BrainRegion>(Ce) ( centralis of the amygdala(Ce) M). Dense projections were also found in the <BrainRegion>BLP</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>basomedial(BMA) , and amygdaloid cortical(ACo) nuclei of the amygdala</BrainRegion>, and in the <BrainRegion>SId/GPv</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>substriatal</BrainRegion>(SStr) , and <BrainRegion>fondus striatal(FStr) rostral areas</BrainRegion>. 2) The region of the <BrainRegion>pontine parabrachial</BrainRegion>(pPB) mainly including the rostral portion of the <BrainRegion>central lateral subnucleus</BrainRegion> ( pontine parabrachial(pPB) cl) and the <BrainRegion>outer-rostral portion of the external lateral subnucleus</BrainRegion> ( pontine parabrachial(pPB) el) projects primarily to the <BrainRegion>lateral portion of the centralis of the amygdala</BrainRegion>(Ce) ( centralis of the amygdala(Ce) L). 3) The region of the <BrainRegion>pontine parabrachial</BrainRegion>(pPB) mainly including the <BrainRegion>dorsolateral subnucleus</BrainRegion> ( pontine parabrachial(pPB) dl), the remaining <BrainRegion>pontine parabrachial</BrainRegion>(pPB) el, and the <BrainRegion>external medial</BrainRegion> ( pontine parabrachial(pPB) em) subnuclei projects primarily to the <BrainRegion>lateral capsular portion of the centralis of the amygdala</BrainRegion>(Ce) ( centralis of the amygdala(Ce) LC) and bilaterally to its rostral portion. Dense projections were also found in the regions which extend the <BrainRegion>centralis of the amygdala</BrainRegion>(Ce) LC rostrally and in the <BrainRegion>SId/GPv</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>substriatal</BrainRegion>(SStr) , and <BrainRegion>fondus striatal(FStr) rostral areas</BrainRegion>. The possible role of each of the three parabrachio-amygdaloid pathways described is discussed. It was suggested that the <BrainRegion>pontine parabrachial(pPB) - centralis</BrainRegion> of the <BrainRegion>amygdala(Ce) M</BrainRegion> pathway is mainly implicated in gustatory processes; the <BrainRegion>pontine parabrachial(pPB) - centralis</BrainRegion> of the <BrainRegion>amygdala(Ce) L</BrainRegion> pathway is mainly implicated in visceral and chemosensitive processes; and the <BrainRegion>pontine parabrachial(pPB) - centralis</BrainRegion> of the <BrainRegion>amygdala(Ce) LC</BrainRegion> pathway is mainly implicated in respiratory, cardiovascular, and nociceptive processes.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Laminar patterns of expression of GABA-A receptor subunit mRNAs in monkey <BrainRegion>sensory motor cortex</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Radioactive complementary RNA probes, made from monkey-specific cDNAs specific for the alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 4, alpha 5, beta 1, beta 2, and gamma 2 subunits of the gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABAA) receptor were used for in situ hybridization histochemistry of the primary motor, somatosensory, and anterior <BrainRegion>parietal areas of the cerebral cortex</BrainRegion> in macaque monkeys. mRNAs for the alpha 1, beta 2, and gamma 2 subunit polypeptides, which form receptors with the full range of classical properties, are expressed at much higher levels in all areas and show laminar- and sublaminar-specific concentrations. alpha 2, alpha 4, alpha 5, and beta 1 subunit transcripts are expressed at much lower levels but also display individual, laminar-specific concentrations; alpha 5 expression, in particular, is highly expressed in layer IV in the <BrainRegion>somatosensory</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>parietal areas</BrainRegion> and in a layer IV-like band in the <BrainRegion>motor cortex</BrainRegion>. In layers in which expression of a particular transcript is high, all neurons may express the gene, but in layers in which expression is moderate, it is possible to detect differences in the degree of labeling of individual neurons for a particular mRNA, and some neurons may not express certain subunit transcripts in detectable amounts. These findings indicate the variability in expression of different gamma-aminobutyric acid A(GABAA) receptor subunits in the <BrainRegion>cerebral cortex</BrainRegion>. Laminar differences may indicate the assembly of functional receptors from different arrangements of available subunits in different classes of cells.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle><BrainRegion>Spinal cord</BrainRegion> afferent systems containing the nerve terminal protein NT75.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>In the adult <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>, immunocytochemical staining for NT75 is concentrated in nerve terminals in the superficial laminae of the dorsal horn. Deeper laminae of the <BrainRegion>dorsal horn</BrainRegion> contain moderate immunocytochemical labeling, but the <BrainRegion>ventral horn</BrainRegion> is only sparsely stained. The origin of spinal nerve terminals containing NT75 was investigated with lesion techniques, colchicine treatment, and retrograde tracing in combination with immunocytochemical staining. Primary afferent neurons express NT75 immunoreactivity and account for most of the dense staining in the superficial <BrainRegion>dorsal horn</BrainRegion> and part of the labeling in the deeper laminae. It was found that corticospinal and virtually all <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion> neurons with descending projections to the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> also express NT75 immunoreactivity, including those terminating in the <BrainRegion>ventral horn</BrainRegion>. Colchicine treatment of the spinal cord also resulted in NT75 staining in most, if not all, spinal neurons. It appears that neurons in all three major sources of <BrainRegion>spinal</BrainRegion> afferents (primary sensory, descending, and intrinsic systems) can express NT75 immunoreactivity, but that some neurons normally contain higher levels of the protein in their nerve terminals. Previous analysis of developing <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> has shown widespread, dense NT75 labeling throughout the <BrainRegion>spinal gray</BrainRegion> in the early postnatal period, which later becomes restricted to the adult pattern. These studies support the hypothesis that many spinal pathways express high levels of NT75 immunoreactivity during development, but that only certain pathways maintain high levels in the adult.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Light microscopic observations of the contacts made between two spindle afferent types and alpha-motoneurons in the cat <BrainRegion>trigeminal motor nucleus</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Previous studies indicate that cat jaw-muscle spindle afferents can be divided into two types (type I and II) on the basis of their axonal trajectories. The present study examined the relationship between spindle afferent fibers and their target masseter alpha-motoneurons in the cat by using the intracellular horseradish peroxidase (HRP) injection technique, and provided several new findings on the synaptic organization generated between the two. Five type I afferent fiber-motoneuron pairs and nine type II afferent-motoneuron pairs were well stained with horseradish peroxidase(HRP) . The following conclusions were drawn: 1) A motoneuron received contacts from only one collateral of any given spindle afferent. 2) The number of contacts made between an afferent and a motoneuron ranged from one to three. 3) The contacts made by a spindle afferent were on the same dendrite or dendrites branching from the same primary dendrite. 4) The vast majority of the contacts made by an afferent on a motoneuron were distributed in the dendritic tree within 600 microns from the soma, i.e., in the proximal three fourths of the dendritic tree. The differences observed between the two afferent types were as follows. First, type II afferent terminals made contacts on more distal dendrites of the motoneurons than did type I afferent terminals. Second, the contacts made between a type I afferent and a motoneuron were clustered together, but those made between a type II afferent and a motoneuron were widely dispersed. The present results provided the general rules of synaptic contacts between the spindle afferents and masseter alpha-motoneurons, and demonstrated that the spatial distribution of synaptic contacts on the dendritic tree was different between type I and type II afferents.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Inhibitory axoaxonal and neuromuscular synapses in the crayfish opener muscle: membrane definition and ultrastructure.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The specific inhibitory motoneuron to the crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) opener muscle provides neuromuscular synapses to the muscle fibers and axoaxonal synapses to the excitatory motor nerve terminals. Freeze fracture of the membrane in both types of synapses show that the presynaptic active zone consists of clusters of large particles (putative calcium channels), which are often encircled by large depressions representing fused synaptic vesicles on the internal leaflet or P face of the presynaptic membrane. Corresponding pits and protrusions mark the external leaflet or E face of the presynaptic membrane. The postsynaptic receptor-bearing surface, characterized for neuromuscular synapses only, consists of rows of particles on both leaflets of the muscle membrane. The organization differs from that seen at excitatory synapses where particles occur only on the E-face leaflet. Serial thin sections of nerve terminals reveal that neuromuscular synapses are significantly larger in proximal fibers than in their central counterparts and support a greater number of presynaptic dense bars (active zones). Axoaxonal synapses also show regional differences; almost three times as many occur in the proximal region compared with the central region. Most synapses possess a single dense bar. The majority of synapses formed by the inhibitory axon are neuromuscular; a minority are axoaxonal. The latter occur in various locations along the excitatory nerve terminals as well as on branches of the axon itself. This preterminal or &quot;off-shore" location could act to cut off entire populations of excitatory synapses or reduce the amplitude of the preterminal action potential.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>The toppler mouse: a novel mutant exhibiting loss of Purkinje cells.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>We describe the genetic and neurological features of toppler, a spontaneous autosomal mutation that appeared in a colony of FVB/N mice and that manifests as severe ataxia appearing at around 12 days of age, worsening with age. The lifespan of affected mice is 8-12 months, with occasional mice living longer. Both homozygous males and females are fertile, and females are able to nurture litters. Histological examination of <BrainRegion>brain</BrainRegion> revealed no striking abnormalities other than the loss of <BrainRegion>cerebellar</BrainRegion> Purkinje cells. The toppler mutation was mapped to mouse chromosome 8, and to assess whether it was novel or a recurrence of a previously described chromosome 8 mouse mutant, toppler mice were crossed with the nervous and tottering mouse mutants. These studies demonstrate that toppler is a unique mouse mutation. Purkinje cell abnormalities in toppler mice were obvious around postnatal day (P) 14, i.e., toppler Purkinje cells already exhibited abnormal morphology. Staining for calbindin, a calcium binding protein enriched in Purkinje cells, showed altered dendritic morphology. Between P14 and P30, dramatic Purkinje cell loss occurred, although there were differences in the degree of Purkinje cell loss in each lobule. At P30, the surviving Purkinje cells expressed zebrin II. From P30 through 6 months, many of the remaining Purkinje cells gradually degenerated. Purkinje cell loss was analyzed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated biotinylated UTP nick end labeling (TUNEL), and Purkinje cells were transferase-mediated biotinylated UTP nick end labeling(TUNEL) -positive most abundantly at P21. In addition, Bergmann glia were transferase-mediated biotinylated UTP nick end labeling(TUNEL) positive at P21, and they expressed activated caspase-3 at earlier time points. Interestingly, despite the apparent death of some Bergmann glia, there was up-regulation of glial fibrillary acidic protein, expressed in astrocytes as well as Bergmann glia. Given the changes in both Purkinje cells and glia in toppler <BrainRegion>cerebellum</BrainRegion>, this may be a very useful model in which to investigate the developmental interaction of Purkinje cells and Bergmann glia.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Projections from the <BrainRegion>lateral nucleus</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>basal nucleus of the amygdala</BrainRegion>: a light and electron microscopic PHA-L study in the rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>A recent study, carried out in the monkey <BrainRegion>brain</BrainRegion> demonstrated a hitherto undescribed projection from the lateral to the <BrainRegion>basal nucleus of the amygdaloid complex</BrainRegion>. In the present study, we used light and electron microscopic techniques to determine whether a similar connection exists in the rat <BrainRegion>brain</BrainRegion> and to define what type(s) of synaptic contacts are produced by fibers of this projection. Injections of the lectin tracer Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) were placed into several levels of the <BrainRegion>lateral nucleus</BrainRegion> and the distribution of fibers in the <BrainRegion>basal (basolateral) nucleus</BrainRegion> was evaluated. All <BrainRegion>lateral nucleus</BrainRegion> injections resulted in labeled fibers in the <BrainRegion>basal nucleus</BrainRegion>, though the density and distribution of labeled fibers depended on the position of the injection site within the <BrainRegion>lateral nucleus</BrainRegion>. In general, the heaviest labeling of the <BrainRegion>basal nucleus</BrainRegion> was observed after injections at <BrainRegion>midrostrocaudal levels of the lateral nucleus</BrainRegion>, especially when the injection was located ventrally. Fibers originating from cells labeled by these injections were observed throughout much of the rostrocaudal extent of the <BrainRegion>basal nucleus</BrainRegion>. Rostrally situated injections resulted in substantially lower levels of labeled fibers in the <BrainRegion>basal nucleus</BrainRegion>. Injections placed caudally in the <BrainRegion>lateral nucleus</BrainRegion> resulted in light to medium levels of labeled fibers in the <BrainRegion>basal nucleus</BrainRegion>; the terminal field in these cases did not extend as far rostrally as after the rostral and midlevel injections. Electron microscopic analysis of Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin(PHA-L) labeled fibers revealed that they contributed synapses to the <BrainRegion>basal nucleus</BrainRegion>. The majority of Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin(PHA-L) labeled terminals formed asymmetric contacts on dendritic spines or shafts; a smaller number of Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin(PHA-L) labeled terminals formed symmetrical synapses.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Reflex connections of the facial and vagal gustatory systems in the <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion> of the bullhead catfish, Ictalurus nebulosus.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The <BrainRegion>primary gustatory sensory nuclei</BrainRegion> in catfish are grossly divisible into a <BrainRegion>vagal lobe</BrainRegion> and a <BrainRegion>facial lobe</BrainRegion>. In this study, the reflex connections of each <BrainRegion>gustatory lobe</BrainRegion> were determined with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) tracing methods. In addition, in order to determine the loci and morphology of the other <BrainRegion>brainstem cranial nerve nuclei</BrainRegion>, horseradish peroxidase(HRP) was applied to the trigeminal, facial, glossopharyngeal, or vagus nerve. The <BrainRegion>sensory fibers of the facial nerve</BrainRegion> terminate in the <BrainRegion>facial lobe</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>facial lobe</BrainRegion> projects bilaterally to the <BrainRegion>posterior thalamic nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>superior secondary gustatory nucleus</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>medial reticular formation of the rostral medulla</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>facial lobe</BrainRegion> has reciprocal connections with the <BrainRegion>n. lobobulbaris</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>medial reticular formation of the rostral medulla</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>descending trigeminal nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>medial and lateral funicular nuclei</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>vagal lobe</BrainRegion>, ipsilaterally; and with the <BrainRegion>facial lobe contralaterally</BrainRegion>. In addition, the <BrainRegion>facial lobe</BrainRegion> receives inputs from the <BrainRegion>raphe nuclei</BrainRegion>, from a <BrainRegion>pretectal nucleus</BrainRegion>, and from perilemniscal neurons located immediately adjacent to the ascending gustatory lemniscal tract at the level of the <BrainRegion>trigeminal motor nucleus</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>gustatory fibers of the vagus nerve</BrainRegion> terminate in the <BrainRegion>vagal lobe</BrainRegion>, while the general visceral sensory fibers terminate in a distinct <BrainRegion>general visceral nucleus</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>vagal lobe</BrainRegion> projects ipsilaterally to the <BrainRegion>superior secondary gustatory nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>lateral reticular formation</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>n. ambiguus</BrainRegion>; and bilaterally to the <BrainRegion>commissural nucleus of Cajal</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>vagal lobe</BrainRegion> has reciprocal connections with the <BrainRegion>ipsilateral lobobulbar nucleus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>facial lobe</BrainRegion>. In addition, the <BrainRegion>vagal lobe</BrainRegion> receives input from neurons of the <BrainRegion>medullary reticular formation</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>perilemniscal neurons of the pontine tegmentum</BrainRegion>. In summary, the <BrainRegion>facial gustatory system</BrainRegion> has connections consonant with its role as an exteroceptive system which works in correlation with trigeminal and spinal afferent systems. In contrast, the vagal gustatory system has connections (e.g., with the <BrainRegion>n. ambiguus</BrainRegion>) more appropriate to a system involved in control of swallowing. These differences in central connectivity mirror the reports on behavioral dissociation of the facial and vagal gustatory systems.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Some features of the spatial organization of the <BrainRegion>central nucleus of the inferior colliculus</BrainRegion> of the cat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>A series of neuroanatomical and neurophysiological experiments have been conducted within the <BrainRegion>central nucleus of the inferior colliculus</BrainRegion> (ICC) of the cat in order to determine some features of the spatial organization of the nucleus. Results from these experiments have demonstrated: (1) the origins of the <BrainRegion>auditory brain stem</BrainRegion> afferents to <BrainRegion>inferior colliculus</BrainRegion>(ICC) and the topography of those projections in relation to the cochleotopic organization of <BrainRegion>inferior colliculus</BrainRegion>(ICC) ; (2) the segregation of at least some of those <BrainRegion>brain stem</BrainRegion> projections within <BrainRegion>inferior colliculus</BrainRegion>(ICC) ; and (3) <BrainRegion>inferior colliculus</BrainRegion>(ICC) neurons with similar response properties (response properties which are often similar or identical to those of neurons in <BrainRegion>brain stem auditory nuclei</BrainRegion>) are often clustered within the nucleus. These results provide evidence that the laminated division of the <BrainRegion>inferior colliculus</BrainRegion>(ICC) probably consists of anatomically, physiologically, and functionally distinct subdivisions and that some aspects of auditory sensation may be encoded or represented separately (i.e., in spatially distinct &quot;regions") within the nucleus.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Cellular localization of Pan-trk immunoreactivity and trkC mRNA in the enteric nervous system.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The members of the trk family of tyrosine receptor kinases, trkA, trkB, and trkC, are the functional receptors for neurotrophins, a family of related neurotrophic factors. In this study, we investigated 1) the distribution of neurotrophin receptors in the developing and adult rat digestive tract with a pan-trk antibody that recognizes all known trks and 2) the cellular localization of trk-encoding mRNAs in the adult gut with single-stranded RNA probes specific for trkA, trkB, and trkC. In the developing myenteric plexus, trk immunoreactivity was present at embryonic day (ED) 14. Cells and fibers immunoreactive for trk could be visualized in the myenteric plexus at embryonic day(ED) 16. At this age, dense staining was found in thick bundles of fibers in proximity to the myenteric plexus in the longitudinal muscle and in association with blood vessels in the mesentery. At embryonic day(ED) 18, trk immunoreactivity was also seen in thin processes running from the myenteric plexus into the circular muscle, and in fibers and cells in intrapancreatic ganglia. By embryonic day(ED) 20, immunoreactive staining was quite dense in both the myenteric and submucosal plexuses. At birth, virtually all enteric ganglia displayed strong trk immunoreactivity; the intensity of the staining at this age made it difficult to discern individual cells. During postnatal development, there was a decrease in cell body staining and an increase in the density of trk-containing fibers that became widely distributed to the gut wall and pancreas. The adult pattern of trk immunoreactivity was established between postnatal days 5 and 10. In adults, trk immunoreactivity was found in numerous enteric and intrapancreatic ganglion cells and in dense networks of fibers innervating all the layers of the gut, the pancreas, and vasculature. The trkC mRNA was expressed in adult enteric ganglion cells of both the myenteric and submucous plexus. By contrast, the trkA and trkB mRNAs could not be detected in enteric ganglia. All three trk mRNAs were expressed in dorsal root ganglia, which were used as positive controls. The density and wide distribution of trk immunoreactivity together with its persistence in adulthood support the concept that neurotrophins play a broad role in the digestive system from development through adult life, perhaps being involved in differentiation, phenotypic expression, and tissue maintenance. The presence of trkC mRNA in enteric neurons along with recent evidence that neurotrophin-3 plays a role in the development of the enteric nervous system suggest that trkC and neurotrophin-3 are a major neurotrophin system in the gastrointestinal tract.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>A diffuse, invaginating cone bipolar cell in primate <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>A bipolar cell type forming invaginating contacts with many cones was found by light and electron microscopy of Golgi preparations of the rhesus monkey <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>. This diffuse, invaginating cone bipolar cell resembles, superficially, rod (&quot;mop") bipolars, and so may correspond to Polyak's "brush" bipolar. However, it differs from rod bipolars in that its dendrites are finer and they end in a single stratum containing cone pedicles in the outer plexiform layer (OPL). In the inner plexiform layer (IPL) its axon terminal is located sclerad (S4) to those of rod bipolars (S5), is thinner, and also more branched, and wider in span than rod bipolars axon terminals. Resectioning of Golgi-impregnated diffuse, invaginating cone bipolars to study their connections in the outer plexiform layer(OPL) shows that their dendrites invaginate as many as seven cone pedicles, and terminate as central elements at the ribbon synaptic complex. Thus, the primate <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> has multiple (diffuse) and single (midget) cone-contacting bipolar cell pathways in both invaginating as well as flat varieties.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Selective uptake and transport of label within three identified neuronal systems after injection of 3H-GABA into the pigeon <BrainRegion>optic tectum</BrainRegion>: an autoradiographic and Golgi study.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>After injection of tritiated gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) into the pigeon <BrainRegion>optic tectum</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion> it was possible to correlate certain aspects of the autoradiographic labeling pattern with observations made from Golgi material. Three neuronal, gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) specific systems were identified both from the uptake of the amino acid and from the subsequent and bidirectional in tracellular transport of labe. The first system derives from cell bodies within sublayer IIi the axons of which could be selectively labelled throughout their course within layer I and to the areas of termination within the <BrainRegion>pretectum</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>ventral thalamus</BrainRegion>. The radially ascending dendrites and axon collaterals of these neurons arbourised within sublayer IIf, and could be labelled in a retrograde fashion after <BrainRegion>tectal</BrainRegion> or <BrainRegion>thalamic</BrainRegion> injections. The second system was represented by small perikarya within sublayer IIc with locally and superficially directed dendrites and with a radially and deep directed axon from which an extensive axon collateral system arose. It was found possible to label these perikarya either directly or indirectly after tangential tectal injections which preferentially labelled the axons and terminals of these neurons within the deeper regions of the <BrainRegion>tectal cortex</BrainRegion> and resulted in the retrograde axonal movement of label to theoverlying cell bodies. A third system was found within sublayer IId, was horizontally organized and from a correlation with degeneration, other autoradiographic and Golgi preparations thought to be mainly dendritic in nature. The biochemical and anatomical implications of specific gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) uptake and subsequent transport of label are discussed and a model of the <BrainRegion>tectal cortex</BrainRegion>, based on the three proposed inhibitory systems and their relation to a number of <BrainRegion>tectal</BrainRegion> afferent inputs, considered.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Diurnal and circadian variation of protein kinase C immunoreactivity in the rat <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>We studied the dependence of the expression of protein kinase C immunoreactivity (PKC-IR) in the rat <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> on the light:dark (LD) cycle and on circadian rhythmicity in complete darkness (DD). Two anti-PKC alpha antibodies were employed: One, which we call PKCalphabeta recognized the hinge region; the other, here termed PKCalpha, recognized the regulatory region of the molecule. Western blots showed that both anti-PKC antibodies stained an identical single band at approximately 80 kD. The <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> neurons showing protein kinase C immunoreactivity(PKC-IR) were rod bipolar cells and a variety of amacrine neurons. After 3 weeks on an light:dark(LD) cycle, PKCalphabeta-IR in both rod bipolar and certain amacrine cells manifested a clear rhythm with a peak at zeitgeber time (ZT) of 06-10 hours and a minimum at zeitgeber time(ZT) 18. No rhythm in total protein kinase C immunoreactivity(PKC-IR) was observed when using the PKCalpha antibody, but, at zeitgeber time(ZT) 06-10 hours, rod bipolar axon terminals showed increased immunostaining. After 48 hours in DD, with either antibody, rod bipolar cells showed increased protein kinase C immunoreactivity(PKC-IR) . The PKCalpha antibody alone revealed that, after 48 hours, AII amacrine neurons, which lacked protein kinase C immunoreactivity(PKC-IR) in an light:dark(LD) cycle, manifested marked protein kinase C immunoreactivity(PKC-IR) , which became stronger after 72 hours. Light administered early in the dark period greatly increased PKCalphabeta-IR in rod bipolar and some amacrine neurons. Our data indicate that light and darkness exert a strong regulatory influence on PKC synthesis, activation, and transport in <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> neurons.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Innervation of the medial rectus muscle in the ratfish, Hydrolagus colliei.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Oculomotor organization in elasmobranch fish (sharks, skates, and rays) differs from that in other vertebrates in that the medial rectus muscle is innervated by contralateral rather than ipsilateral motoneurons. Distinguishing whether this innervation pattern is unique to the elasmobranchs, or is the ancestral pattern for cartilaginous fishes, requires examination of a representative of the sister group to the elasmobranchs, the holocephalans (ratfish). In the present study, the innervation pattern of the medial rectus was examined in a ratfish, Hydrolagus colliei, by using biotinylated dextran amines (BDA, 3,000 MW). Labeled cells were revealed in the <BrainRegion>contralateral oculomotor nucleus</BrainRegion>. Therefore, an innervation pattern in which the medial rectus muscle is innervated by contralateral motoneurons is the primitive condition for cartilaginous fishes.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Thalamocortical projections in the reeler mutant mouse.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The normal radial distribution of the different <BrainRegion>neocortical</BrainRegion> cell classes is inverted in the reeler mutant mouse. The organization of the thalamocortical projection in adult reelers has been investigated by using anterograde degeneration techniques. Thalamocortical axons follow anomalous trajectories to their target cytoarchitectonic fields in the mutant. After leaving the internal capsule, the axons ascend in sigmoid-shaped fascicles to enter a fiber stratum near the <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> surface. The axons course through this superficial stratum until they reach their target fields and then descend to terminate in deeper <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> planes. In the normal animal, by contrast, the axons course tangentially at the interface of the <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion> with the <BrainRegion>subcortical white matter</BrainRegion>; upon reaching their target fields, they ascend to terminate more superficially in the <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion>. Thus, in both genotypes the tangential portions of the axon trajectories pass through the polymorphic cell population. Both with respect to degree of divergence and the radial distribution of terminals within the different cytoarchitectonic fields, the thalamocortical projection in reeler, like that in the normal animal, appears to be composed of two distinct axon classes. The &quot;class I" axons, the less-divergent system which terminates densely in two or three tiers within the <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion>, are the subject of the present analysis. The &quot;class I" projections form an orderly <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> representation of the <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion>: Despite distortions in the topography of the reeler <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion>, both the nucleus to field relationships and the detailed topologic organization of the projection appear to be normal. The terminals of class I projections are distributed in radially segregated tiers that resemble the tiered pattern of termination as in normal mice, and there are field-specific variations in the tiers that, like those of normal mice, are systematically related to variations of <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> cytoarchitecture. Thus, similar mechanisms, which may depend in part on the interaction of ingrowing axons with specific postsynaptic cell surfaces, must determine the restricted radial distribution of thalamocortical projections in both genotypes. However, there is an abnormal mix of somata and dendrites at all radial levels of the mutant <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion>, suggesting that the spatial domain of termination of thalamocortical axons may be governed to some extent by factors other than the distribution of specific prospective postsynaptic cell surfaces. The reeler mutation alters the radial but not the tangential structure of the <BrainRegion>neocortex</BrainRegion>, suggesting that these two aspects of <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> organization develop under the control of independent mechanisms. The present results suggest that despite the anomalies of radial position, normal relationships between thalamocortical afferents and distinct classes of postsynaptic elements with characteristic radial distributions are largely conserved in reeler. Certain types of aberrant connections are highly probable, however.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Neuronal architecture of the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion> in the hamster.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>This study provides a scheme for subdividing the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion> of the hamster on the basis of cytoarchitectonic criteria, cell measurements, and neuronal cell types identified with the Golgi method. Reduced silver-stained sections revealed the feltlike neuropil that characterizes the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion> and were used to define the boundaries of the nuclear complex. Adjacent sections stained for Nissl substance revealed ten subdivisions, each with a characteristic neuronal architecture based on cell sizes, shapes, and packing density. Some subdivisions, e.g., the <BrainRegion>ventral and medial subnuclei</BrainRegion>, were identified at all rostrocaudal levels of the nuclear complex, while other subdivisions, e.g., the <BrainRegion>caudally located dorsolateral and ventrolateral subnuclei</BrainRegion>, were restricted to particular levels. Golgi preparations were counterstained for Nissl substance, thus allowing dendro- and cytoarchitecture to be compared directly. This material permitted the identification of a number of functionally relevant features of the neuronal constituents of the subdivisions. This approach, employing three cytological methods, has permitted the assembly of a detailed atlas of the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion>. The subdivisions of the present atlas have been compared with their likely counterparts identified in previous investigations of the mammalian <BrainRegion>nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion>. In order to relate cytoarchitecture with primary afferent termination sites and to define the gustatory-recipient subdivisions, the differential relationships of the subdivisions with lingual afferent projections in the hamster are also described. The present parcellation scheme is intended to facilitate anatomical and physiological investigations of the types of circuits that compose the medullary gustatory and general visceral sensory systems.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Development of microglia in the albino rabbit <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>In this study the development of ameboid microglia and resting microglia in the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> of the albino rabbit has been examined by means of a lectin derived from Griffonia simplicifolia. Ameboid microglia are present in the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> as early as E12, when the optic fissure is in the process of closure, and appear to be concentrated initially at the vitreal surface. At E14 many ameboid microglia can be seen to extend processes to the ventricular surface of the cytoblast layer, but in subsequent ages these cells are rare and ameboid microglia are largely confined to the ganglion cell layer, inner plexiform layer, and occasionally the developing inner nuclear layer. By adult life, mature (or resting) microglia are confined to the inner plexiform and ganglion cell layers. Numbers of microglia increase steadily throughout fetal life from a mean of 400 at E14, the earliest age quantified, to a peak of 28,600 at E30. There is a small postnatal drop in numbers to 17,150 at P9. Microglia could only be labelled faintly in animals older than P11, but analysis of two adult (P130) <BrainRegion>retinas</BrainRegion> with adequate labelling suggested that numbers rise to a value of about 23,800 at this age. Ameboid microglia thus appear in the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> 11 days prior to the onset of axon loss in the optic nerve (about E23) and 14 days prior to the beginning of the period of reduction of <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> ganglion cell numbers (about E26). The present findings indicate that while some microglial precursors may enter the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> in response to debris generated during the natural <BrainRegion>retinal</BrainRegion> ganglion cell death period, most enter the <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> well before this period. Also, microglia present a uniform density distribution with apparently regular spacing as early as E16, so the uniform regular distribution cannot simply be the consequence of regularly distributed pyknotic figures as previously suggested.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Divergent backward projections from the <BrainRegion>anterior part of the inferotemporal cortex</BrainRegion> (area TE) in the macaque.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The organization of backward projections from the <BrainRegion>anterior part of the inferotemporal cortex</BrainRegion> (area TE) to the <BrainRegion>posterior part of the inferotemporal cortex</BrainRegion> (area TEO) was studied in the macaque monkey by using the anterograde tracer Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin (PHA-L). The objectives of the study were to investigate this backward projection and to compare it with 1) the backward projections that have been described previously in the early sensory areas and 2) the forward projection from <BrainRegion>area TEO</BrainRegion> to <BrainRegion>area TE</BrainRegion>. After a single iontophoretic injection of PHA-L into <BrainRegion>area TE</BrainRegion> in three monkeys, a dense distribution of labeled terminals was observed in <BrainRegion>area TEO</BrainRegion> and in the <BrainRegion>ventral bank of the superior temporal sulcus</BrainRegion> (<BrainRegion>area PITd</BrainRegion>) that adjoined <BrainRegion>area TEO</BrainRegion>. A less dense distribution was observed in <BrainRegion>areas V4</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>V2</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>V1</BrainRegion>. Clusters of labeled terminals in <BrainRegion>areas TEO</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>PITd</BrainRegion> extended more than 4 mm along the <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> surface. The forward projections from <BrainRegion>area TEO</BrainRegion> to <BrainRegion>area TE</BrainRegion> also were studied for comparison by reanalyzing two previous cases (Saleem et al. ¿1993 <BrainRegion>Cerebral Cortex</BrainRegion> 3:454-464). These projections (from <BrainRegion>area TEO</BrainRegion> to <BrainRegion>area TE</BrainRegion>) were more focal than the terminations that occurred in <BrainRegion>area TEO</BrainRegion> after injections into <BrainRegion>area TE</BrainRegion>. Nine single axons projecting from <BrainRegion>area TE</BrainRegion> to <BrainRegion>areas TEO/PITd</BrainRegion> were reconstructed through serial sections. These showed variable, complex branching patterns with multiple arbors (1-12). Arbors were localized in layers 1-3 for four axons, in layer 1 for one axon, layers 5 and 6 for two axons, and in both layers 1-3 and layers 5-6 for two axons. Axons with horizontally elongated arbors confined to layer 1 were not predominant. The size of the individual arbors of these axons along their long axes tended to be larger (1.56 +/- 1.24 mm) than those of <BrainRegion>TEO</BrainRegion>-to-<BrainRegion>TE</BrainRegion> forward axons (&amp;lt;0.6 mm). Thus, the authors conclude that, like other backward systems described to date, those from <BrainRegion>area TE</BrainRegion> to <BrainRegion>areas TEO/PITd</BrainRegion> are divergent. However, single axons have more variable laminar patterns of terminal distribution than those in the other backward systems.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Visual subdivisions of the <BrainRegion>dorsal ventricular ridge</BrainRegion> of the iguana (Iguana iguana) as determined by electrophysiologic mapping.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The <BrainRegion>dorsal ventricular ridge</BrainRegion> (DVR) of reptiles is one of two regions of the reptilian <BrainRegion>telencephalon</BrainRegion> that receives input from the <BrainRegion>dorsal thalamus</BrainRegion>. Although studies demonstrate that two <BrainRegion>visual thalamic nuclei</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>dorsal lateral geniculate</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>rotundus</BrainRegion>, send afferents to the <BrainRegion>dorsal cortex</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>DVR</BrainRegion>, respectively, relatively little is known about physiologic representations. The present study determined the organization of the visual recipient region of the iguana <BrainRegion>DVR</BrainRegion>. Microelectrode mapping techniques were used to determine the extent, number of subdivisions, and retinotopy within the visually responsive region of the <BrainRegion>anterior DVR</BrainRegion> (ADVR). Visually responsive neurons were restricted to the <BrainRegion>anterior two thirds of the ADVR</BrainRegion>. Within this region, two topographically organized subdivisions were determined. Each subdivision contained a full representation of the visual field and could be distinguished from the other by differences in receptive field properties and reversals in receptive field progressions across their mutual border. A third subdivision of the <BrainRegion>ADVR</BrainRegion>, in which neurons are responsive to visual stimulation is also described; however, a distinct visuotopic representation could not be determined for this region. This third region forms a shell surrounding the lateral, dorsal, and medial aspects of the topographically organized subdivisions. These results demonstrate that there are multiple physiologic subdivisions in the thalamic recipient zone of the <BrainRegion>ADVR</BrainRegion> of the iguana. Comparisons to the <BrainRegion>ADVR</BrainRegion> of other reptiles are made, homologies to ectostriatial regions of the bird are proposed, and the findings are discussed in relation to <BrainRegion>telencephalic</BrainRegion> organization of other vertebrates.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Enhanced survival and morphological features of <BrainRegion>basal forebrain</BrainRegion> cholinergic neurons in vitro: role of neurotrophins and other potential cortically derived cholinergic trophic factors.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The present study examined survival- and growth-enhancing effects of <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> cells on <BrainRegion>basal forebrain</BrainRegion> cholinergic neurons (BFCNs) in culture and the degree to which endogenous nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) contribute to those trophic effects. When fetal (17 days of gestation) basal forebrain (BF) cells were grown for 5 days in coculture with <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> neurons, staining for acetylcholinesterase (AChE) showed a threefold increase in the number of BFCNs relative to BF cultures without <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion>. Most of these labeled cells also displayed enhanced somatic, dendritic, and axonal growth. Coculturing cortical neurons with BF cells taken from postnatal animals produced similar results but with a somewhat greater degree of morphologic enhancement. Function-neutralizing antibodies to NGF, BDNF, and NT-3 were employed to determine whether they would block the trophic effects of cortical neurons on postnatal BFCNs. Although no significant changes in numbers or morphological features of AChE(+) neurons were observed with treatment with individual antibodies, cocultures treated with a combination of all three antibodies displayed fewer morphologically enhanced AChE(+) cells and more nonenhanced cells; the total number of AChE(+) neurons was not significantly changed. Treatment of pure BF cultures with exogenous NGF, BDNF, and NT-3 increased the number of AChE(+) neurons but did not reproduce the morphologic enhancement of <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> cells on BFCNs. These results suggest that neurotrophins by themselves can increase survival of postnatal BFCNs in culture and may work in concert with other unknown cortically derived factors to enhance BFCN morphologic differentiation. The unidentified cortical factors may also have strong survival-enhancing effects on BFCNs that are independent of the known neurotrophins.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Peptide changes in the <BrainRegion>parabrachial nucleus</BrainRegion> following cervical vagal stimulation.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Previous studies in our laboratory have shown that the peptides, neurotensin (NT), cholecystokinin (CCK), substance P (SP), somatostatin (SOM), and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), have a role in modulating ascending visceral sensory information from the <BrainRegion>nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>thalamus</BrainRegion> via a mandatory synapse in the <BrainRegion>parabrachial nucleus</BrainRegion> (PB). In this investigation, we examined the changes in the levels of these peptides detected by immunohistochemistry in response to cervical vagal stimulation in the inactin-anesthetized male Wistar rat. Paired control and experimental animals were instrumented to monitor blood pressure and heart rate. The vagus nerve was stimulated for 0.5, 2, or 4 hours, after which time the animals were perfused and the brains processed immunohistochemically for the Fos protein and the peptides NT, CCK, SP, SOM, and CGRP. Vagal stimulation for 1 hour produced large numbers of Fos-positive cells in the <BrainRegion>external lateral (el), external medial (em), and central lateral (cl) subnuclei of the PB</BrainRegion> (N = 3). Vagal stimulation produced a reduction in the level of immunolabeling for NT, SOM, and CCK in the <BrainRegion>el and em subnuclei of the PB</BrainRegion>. This depletion was present at 0.5 hour and increased in magnitude with the length of vagal stimulation, reaching a maximum after 4 hours. In contrast, the immunolabeling for SP and CGRP increased after 0.5 hour, reaching a maximum after 2 hours of vagal stimulation in the <BrainRegion>el and em subnuclei of the PB</BrainRegion>. After 4 hours of vagal stimulation, the immunolabeling for SP and CGRP was depleted in the two <BrainRegion>PB subnuclei</BrainRegion>. Thus, the neuropeptides NT, CCK, SP, SOM, and CGRP, which modulate the visceral sensory information in the <BrainRegion>PB</BrainRegion>, are influenced somewhat differentially by the level of activity in the vagus nerve.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Organization of the motoneurons innervating the pelvic muscles of the male rat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The cytoarchitecture of the motoneuron pool of the male rat was studied at the lumbo-sacral transition area, particularly in L6. In the latter segment a dorso-medial (DM), ventral (V), dorso-lateral (DL), and retrodorso-lateral group (RDL) could be defined. The DL group was associated with a prominent longitudinal dendrite bundle and the CM group with smaller transverse bundles. Moreover, close soma-somatic apposition was found between neurons in these columns. Because L6 gives rise to n. pudendus and contributes to n. ischiadicus, horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was applied to the cut n. ischiadicus and in other experiments injected into the pelvic muscles. Neurons in RDL were labeled following exposure of n. ischiadicus to HRP. Injections in m. levator ani resulted in labeled neurons in the V group, mainly below L6. Injections in m. sphincter urethrae resulted in labeled neurons in the DL group as well as neurons immediately cranial to this column. Musculus ischiocavernosus injections resulted in transport of HRP to neurons in the DL group, primarily in its medial part, and to more cranially located neurons. In addition, some neurons in the V group in L6 were labeled. Following injections in m. bulbocavernosus and m. sphincter ani, labeled neurons were found primarily in the DM group, and to a lesser extent in the V group. Histochemical investigations with staining methods for the localization of acetyl cholinesterase (AChE) and heavy metals (the Timm method) demonstrated that part of the neuropil of DL and of DM were different from the rest of the motoneuron neuropil. In the DL group the area with the diverging staining patterns corresponded to the region of the dendrite bundle. The experimental data indicated and the ultrastructural studies demonstrated that the histochemical differences could be correlated with differences in the composition of the populations of boutons. The comparison of the cytoarchitectural and histochemical data with the results obtained by the aid of the retrograde HRP tracing technique established that mm. sphincter urethrae, ischiocavernosus, bulbocavernosus, and sphincter ani were each innervated by two populations of neurons that were situated in separate areas which had different histochemical properties, and which thus probably have different compositions of their afferent inputs. The duality in the motoneuron pool that innervates the pelvic mucscle might be a reflection of the dual influence on these muscles. As all other striated muscles the pelvic muscles are under voluntary control. However, they are also tightly linked to the function of the pelvic viscera and thus under influence of the autonomic nervous system.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Retinoic acid signaling at sites of plasticity in the mature central nervous system.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>We used transgenic reporter mice to determine whether <BrainRegion>brain</BrainRegion> regions that respond to retinoic acid (RA) during development do so in maturity. We focused on two prominent sites of embryonic RA signaling: the <BrainRegion>dorsal spinal cord</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>. In the mature <BrainRegion>dorsal spinal cord</BrainRegion>, expression of a direct repeat 5 RA response element (DR5-RARE) transgene is seen in interneurons in laminae I and II, as well as in ependymal cells around the central canal. In the <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>, DR5-RARE transgene-expressing neurons are seen in the mature granule cell and periglomerular layers, as well as in cells in the <BrainRegion>subventricular zone of the forebrain</BrainRegion>-the established source for newly generated granule and periglomerular neurons. In addition, there are transgene-labeled neurons in a small number of other <BrainRegion>brain</BrainRegion> regions. These include the <BrainRegion>spinal trigeminal nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>area postrema</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>habenula</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>amygdala</BrainRegion>, and the <BrainRegion>cerebral cortex</BrainRegion>. Thus, a distinct type of RA-mediated gene expression, detected with the DR5-RARE reporter transgene, defines neurons, subependymal, or ependymal cells in discrete locations throughout the neuraxis. Some of these cells--particularly those in the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion>--are found in central nervous system regions that receive local RA signals early in development, and retain a significant amount of functional or structural plasticity in the adult.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Ultrastructural immunocytochemical localization of mu opioid receptors and Leu5-enkephalin in the patch compartment of the rat <BrainRegion>caudate-putamen nucleus</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>To delineate the cellular sites for the motor effects of opiates acting at the mu opioid receptor (MOR) in the rat <BrainRegion>caudate-putamen nucleus</BrainRegion>, we examined the ultrastructural immunogold and immunoperoxidase labeling of an antipeptide antiserum specific for the MOR. We also combined these labeling methods to examine the subcellular relationship between the MOR and the endogenous opioid peptide, Leu5-enkephalin (LE). By light microscopy, MOR-labeling was seen in a heterogeneous patchy distribution. Electron microscopic analysis of these patches showed that more than 80% of the total neuronal profiles (n = 1,586) containing MOR-like immunoreactivity (MOR-IR) were dendrites and dendritic spines. The remaining labeled profiles included a few perikarya and many axon terminals. MOR-IR was predominantly localized to extrasynaptic plasma membranes of dendrites, and to both synaptic vesicles and plasma membranes in terminals. Ten percent of the total MOR-labeled terminals (n = 272) formed asymmetric synapses with unlabeled or MOR-labeled dendritic spines. Terminals containing LE-IR formed synapses, in almost equal proportions, on MOR-labeled dendrites and dendritic spines, while over 80% of the unlabeled terminals formed synapses on MOR-labeled dendritic spines. Moreover, colocalization of MOR- and LE-IR was often seen in both dendrites and terminals. These results indicate that in patch compartments of the <BrainRegion>caudate-putamen nucleus</BrainRegion>, the MOR is mainly involved in extrasynaptic modulation of spiny neurons, including those that contain LE. In addition, the findings provide a cellular basis for presynaptic opioid modulation of neurotransmitter release through MOR located on axon terminals.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Distribution of cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript peptide in the guinea pig intrinsic cardiac nervous system and colocalization with neuropeptides or transmitter synthetic enzymes.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>This study was conducted to establish the presence of cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript peptide (CARTp) immunoreactivity in neurons and fibers within guinea pig atrial whole-mount preparations containing the intrinsic cardiac ganglia. Many cardiac ganglia, but not all, in a given whole-mount preparation, were innervated by CARTp-immunoreactive (IR) fibers. Following explant culture of whole mounts for 72 hours, the CARTp-IR fiber networks were absent, but the number of CARTp-IR neurons was increased markedly. These observations suggested that the majority of the CARTp-IR fibers in the intracardiac ganglia were derived from sources extrinsic to the heart. In control whole-mount preparations, very few CARTp-positive neurons were present. The few intrinsic CARTp-IR neurons also exhibited choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) immunoreactivity, indicating that they make up a small subpopulation of cholinergic postganglionic neurons. Some CARTp-IR neurons also exhibited nitric oxide synthase (NOS) immunoreactivity, indicating that they were nitrergic as well. We compared the immunohistochemical staining patterns of CARTp-IR fibers with the staining patterns of a number of other neurotransmitters or neurotransmitter synthetic enzymes that mark specific extrinsic inputs. The CARTp-IR fibers were not immunoreactive for ChAT, tyrosine hydroxylase, calcitonin gene-related peptide, or substance P. However, virtually all CARTp-IR fibers exhibited immunoreactivity to neuronal NOS (a marker for nitric oxide-producing neurons). CARTp-IR cells and NOS-IR cells were present in the nodose ganglia. In addition, CARTp-IR neurons in the nodose also were stained positively for NADPH-diaphorase. Thus, we propose that most CARTp-IR fibers within the guinea pig intrinsic cardiac ganglia are vagal afferent fibers that also contain NOS.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>An intracellular electrophysiological study of the ontogeny of functional synapses in the rabbit <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>. II. Amacrine cells.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Intracellular recordings in an isolated perfused <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>-eyecup preparation of the neonate rabbit were used to study the physiological development of amacrine cells. By responding with transient depolarizations at the onset and termination of illumination, mature mammalian on-off amacrine cell recordings appeared similar to those described in lower vertebrates. However, immature amacrine cell recordings showed a predominantly on response, with off responses small and easily fatigued during repetitive stimulation. This underdeveloped off component of the amacrine cell response could also be abolished by decreasing the area of receptive field that was stimulated. The more slowly developing off component may reflect a different maturation rate of depolarizing (on) and hyperpolarizing (off) bipolar cells. In addition, properties of the maturing inner plexiform layer were examined with extracellular recordings of the proximal negative response (PNR). The PNR showed evidence of easy fatigability more evident in the off response. These observations are consistent with the idea that the initial phase of light sensitivity is associated with labile synaptic input from bipolar cells.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Age-related decreases in Nurr1 immunoreactivity in the human <BrainRegion>substantia nigra</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Nuclear receptor-related factor 1 (Nurr1), a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, is associated with the induction of dopaminergic (DA) phenotypes in developing and mature <BrainRegion>midbrain</BrainRegion> neurons. It is well established that dopaminergic nigrostriatal function decreases with age. Whether age-related deficits in DA phenotypic markers are associated with alterations in Nurr1 expression is unknown. The present study found that virtually all of tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive (TH-ir) neurons within the young adult human <BrainRegion>substantia nigra</BrainRegion> were Nurr1-immunoreactive (Nurr1-ir) positive. Stereologic counts revealed a significant reduction in the number of Nurr1-ir nigral neurons in middle-aged (23.13%) and aged (46.33%) individuals relative to young subjects. The loss of Nurr1-ir neurons was associated with a similar decline in TH-ir neuron number. In this regard, TH-ir neuronal number was decreased in middle-aged (11.10%) and in aged (45.97%) subjects, and this loss of TH-ir neurons was highly correlated (r = 0.92) with the loss of Nurr1-ir neurons. In contrast, the number of melanin-containing nigral neuron number was generally stable across age groups, indicating that changes in Nurr1 and TH reflect phenotypic age-related changes and not frank neuronal degeneration. In support of this concept, confocal microscopic analyses of Nurr1-ir and TH-ir fluorescence intensity revealed parallel decreases in Nurr1- and TH-immunofluorescence as a function of age. These data demonstrate that age-related decline of DA phenotypic markers is associated with down-regulation of Nurr1 expression in the SN.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Distribution of tyrosine hydroxylase-containing neurons and fibers in the <BrainRegion>brain</BrainRegion> of the budgerigar (Melopsittacus undulatus): general patterns and labeling in <BrainRegion>vocal control nuclei</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The distribution of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) was mapped out in cells and fibers of the budgerigar (Melopsittacus undulatus) <BrainRegion>brain</BrainRegion>. Special attention was given to <BrainRegion>vocal control and auditory nuclei</BrainRegion> because budgerigars are a psittacine species in which both males and females are capable of lifelong vocal learning (Farabaugh et al. [1994] J. Comp. Psychol 108:81-92). The results show that TH staining in the <BrainRegion>central nucleus of the anterior archistriatum</BrainRegion> (AAc) resembled that of surrounding <BrainRegion>archistriatal fields</BrainRegion>, except for portions of the <BrainRegion>ventral archistriatum</BrainRegion>, which exhibited substantially more TH+ fibers. Fewer fibers and fiber baskets are present in the <BrainRegion>central nucleus of the lateral neostriatum</BrainRegion> (NLc) than in surrounding fields. Both the <BrainRegion>oval nuclei of the ventral hyperstriatum</BrainRegion> (HVo) and <BrainRegion>anterior neostriatum</BrainRegion> (NAo) exhibit less fiber staining than surrounding fields whereas fiber staining in the <BrainRegion>medial NAo</BrainRegion> (NAom) and <BrainRegion>magnicellular nucleus of the parolfactory lobe</BrainRegion> (LPOm) resemble that of surrounding fields. Staining in <BrainRegion>primary telencephalic auditory nuclei</BrainRegion> was extremely low. The only sex difference observed was slightly increased TH staining in <BrainRegion>LPOm</BrainRegion> of females compared with surrounding fields on some tissue sections. These findings are in contrast to previous findings in zebra finch (Poephila guttata), a close ended vocal learning songbird in which TH staining in <BrainRegion>vocal nuclei</BrainRegion> increases during development and remains greater than surrounding fields throughout adulthood. The present results therefore support the view that catecholamines act to inhibit vocal plasticity in adult vocal learning species. Several unique features of TH-immunoreactive (ir) cell groups were observed in the <BrainRegion>brainstem</BrainRegion> including sparsely scattered TH-ir somata immediately adjacent to the <BrainRegion>third ventricle</BrainRegion>, within the <BrainRegion>tectum</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>basal forebrain</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>archistriatum</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>caudal neostriatum</BrainRegion>, and in the <BrainRegion>hippocampus</BrainRegion>. These latter populations have not been described in other avian species and resemble features of the catecholamine system generally found in either reptiles or mammals.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Human <BrainRegion>olfactory epithelium</BrainRegion> in normal aging, Alzheimer&apos;s disease, and other neurodegenerative disorders.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>By use of immunohistochemistry, we characterized the molecular phenotype of human <BrainRegion>olfactory epithelial</BrainRegion> (OE) cells and assessed the nature of the dystrophic olfactory neurites described initially in Alzheimer&apos;s disease (AD). Keratin 8 was present in all classes of <BrainRegion>OE</BrainRegion> cells. Sustentacular cells lacked other cell type specific polypeptides and were distinguished from neurons and basal cells because the latter two classes of <BrainRegion>OE</BrainRegion> cells expressed neural cell adhesion molecules (N-CAMs) and microtubule associated proteins (MAPs), i.e., MAP5. Basal cells expressed nerve growth factor receptors (NGFRs), which distinguished them from olfactory neurons. Unlike their perikarya, olfactory axons expressed vimentin and GAP-43, but not peripherin or neurofilament (NF) proteins. Olfactory nerves were distinguished from other axons because the latter were positive for all three NF subunits and peripherin, in addition to vimentin and GAP-43. Dystrophic neurites in the <BrainRegion>OE</BrainRegion> were GAP-43 positive, but they also expressed proteins that were not detected in normal olfactory nerves (i.e., synaptophysin, MAP2, tau, peripherin, NF proteins). Further, rare NF positive olfactory neurons gave rise to NF positive dystrophic neurites. These neurites were present in all 11 AD cases, 11 of 14 subjects with other neurodegenerative diseases, and 6 of 8 neurologically normal adult controls, but no dystrophic neurites were seen in 9 fetal and neonatal cases. We conclude that the molecular phenotype of different human <BrainRegion>OE</BrainRegion> cells is distinct and that dystrophic olfactory neurites occur very frequently in neurologically normal adults. The relevance of these neurites to aging or specific disease processes remains speculative.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Multiple gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)-immunoreactive systems in the brain of the dwarf gourami, Colisa lalia: immunohistochemistry and radioimmunoassay.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The present study characterizes gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neuronal groups that are located in several different brain regions by investigating GnRH molecular species and projection patterns in an anabantid fish, Colisa lalia. First, we examined the molecular species of GnRHs in extracts of the brain and the pituitary by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography followed by radioimmunoassays. We found salmon GnRH (sGnRH), chicken GnRH-II (cGnRH-II), and an unfamiliar GnRH-like substance. Next, to examine the distribution of each GnRH molecule in different GnRH neuronal groups, we performed immunohistochemistry using four kinds of antisera and an antibody. Furthermore, we performed brain lesioning experiments of terminal nerve (TN) cells, the most conspicuous GnRH-immunoreactive cells in Colisa lalia. Comparisons of immunoreactive structures between TN-lesioned fish and untreated fish elucidated the projection area of each neuronal group. Three major neuronal groups were observed. TN-GnRH cells, which are located in the transitional area between the <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>telencephalon</BrainRegion>, showed strong sGnRH and weaker cGnRH-II immunoreactivity. TN-GnRH cells projected to wide areas of the central nervous system from the <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> to the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>. The second group, located in the <BrainRegion>preoptic area</BrainRegion>, showed only sGnRH immunoreactivity and projected only to the <BrainRegion>pituitary</BrainRegion>. The third one, located in the midbrain <BrainRegion>tegmentum</BrainRegion>, exhibited strong cGnRH-II and weaker sGnRH immunoreactivity. This cell group projected mainly to brain regions posterior to the <BrainRegion>hypothalamus</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>. These different projection patterns suggest functional differentiation of each GnRH neuronal group.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Expression of nitric oxide synthase and nitric oxide-sensitive guanylate cyclase in the crustacean cardiac ganglion.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The cardiac ganglion is a simple central pattern-generating network that controls the rhythmic contractions of the crustacean heart. Enzyme assays and Western blots show that whole heart homogenates from the crab Cancer productus contain high levels of nitric oxide synthase (NOS), an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of arginine to citrulline with concomitant production of the transmitter nitric oxide (NO). Crab heart NOS is calcium-dependent and has an apparent molecular weight of 110 kDa. In the cardiac ganglion, antibodies to NOS and citrulline indicate the presence of a NOS-like protein and NOS enzymatic activity in the four small pacemaker neurons and the five large motor neurons of the cardiac network. In addition, all cardiac neurons label positively with an antibody to cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). The NO donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP, 10 mM) stimulates additional cGMP production in the isolated ganglion. This increase is blocked by [(1)H](1,2,4)oxadiazole(4,3-a)quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ, 50 microM), an inhibitor of the NO-sensitive soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC). Taken together, our data indicate that NO- and cGMP-mediated signaling pathways are enriched in the cardiac system relative to other crab tissues and that the cardiac network may be a target for extrinsic and intrinsic neuromodulation via NO produced from the heart musculature and individual cardiac neurons, respectively. The crustacean cardiac ganglion is therefore a promising system for studying cellular and synaptic mechanisms of nitrergic neuromodulation in a simple pattern-generating network.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Schwann cell-neuronal interactions in the rat involve nerve growth factor.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>To gain some insight into possible functions of nerve growth factor (NGF), we suppressed the endogenous levels of NGF in newborn rats by subcutaneous injections (3 microliters/g body weight) of rabbit antibodies to purified mouse beta-NGF (ANTI-NGF). Fiber and axonal areas and perimeters were measured for unmyelinated and myelinated sensory fibers in T9 dorsal roots (DR) in three groups of animals: 1) ANTI-NGF treated littermates, 2) preimmune sera treated littermates (PREIMM), and 3) untreated littermates (UNTR). In some rats, fibers in ventral roots (VR) were measured and, in other rats, sensory processes in peripheral nerves (PN) were measured following radical ventral rhizotomy. The only outer area and perimeter measurements that were statistically different were those in the ventral root (P less than 0.013 and P less than 0.043, respectively). However, myelin thickness was significantly thinner in the dorsal roots of the ANTI-NGF group than in the dorsal roots of the UNTR and PREIMM groups (P less than 0.000009 and P less than 10(-6), respectively). Myelin thickness in the ventral roots of the ANTI-NGF group was also statistically thinner than that in the UNTR group (P less than 0.001). There were no statistically significant differences when comparing the UNTR group to the PREIMM group. In the peripheral nerves studied, there was no significant change in the myelin thickness between the ANTI-NGF and UNTR groups of animals. These results indicate that Schwann cell-neuronal interactions are altered by the inactivation of NGF, and that 1) the central processes of sensory fibers are affected and not the peripheral processes and 2) motor fiber myelination is altered.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Primary afferent terminals that express presynaptic NR1 in rats are mainly from myelinated, mechanosensitive fibers.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Presynaptic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in terminals of primary afferents to <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> of rats were first reported by Liu et al. (1994; Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91:8383-8387) and were proposed to modulate nociceptive input (Liu et al. [1997] Nature 386:721-724). We previously demonstrated kainate and AMPA receptors in numerous primary afferent terminals in the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> fixed with diluted paraformaldehyde and no glutaraldehyde. Therefore, we reinvestigated the occurrence of presynaptic NMDAR1 (NR1) with this fixation protocol. With confocal microscopy, numerous immunofluorescent puncta were double-stained for NR1 and the presynaptic marker synaptophysin throughout the <BrainRegion>spinal gray</BrainRegion>. NR1-immunostained puncta costained more frequently with a tracer that labels myelinated afferents (cholera toxin subunit B; CTB) than with a tracer that labels non-peptidergic unmyelinated afferents (Griffonia simplicifolia isolectin B4; IB4). Virtually no double staining was found for NR1 and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), which labels somatic peptidergic primary afferents. In the <BrainRegion>gracile nucleus</BrainRegion>, virtually all puncta labeled for CTB appeared immunopositive for NR1. At the electron microscopic level, most immunopositive terminals in <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>gracile nucleus</BrainRegion> displayed morphological characteristics of endings of myelinated primary afferents. NR1 was presynaptic in 60-65% of all synapses in which it was expressed pre- or postsynaptically, or both, in spinal laminae I-IV. Estimates for the <BrainRegion>gracile nucleus</BrainRegion> were higher (80%). No presynaptic NR1 was found in the <BrainRegion>ventroposterior thalamus</BrainRegion>. Because of the relative sparsity of presynaptic NR1 in terminals in laminae I and IIo and in terminals of peptidergic unmyelinated afferents, it is suggested that presynaptic NMDA receptors play a more significant role in modulation of mechanosensitive, innocuous input than in nociception.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>CalbindinD28k- and parvalbumin-immunoreactive neurons form complementary sublaminae in the rat <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>By using light microscopic immunocytochemistry and computer analysis, we have mapped the distributions of two calcium-binding proteins (CaBPs), calbindinD28k (CB) and parvalbumin (PV), in the rat <BrainRegion>superior colliculus</BrainRegion> (SC). The patterns of CaBP expression were complementary. A band of heavily labeled, medium-sized CB-immunoreactive cells (CB-cells) was centered in the optic layer (OL), whereas PV-immunoreactive cells (PV-cells) were found predominantly in the intermediate gray layer (IGL), where they were clustered within patches of PV-labeled fibers. The superficial gray layer (SGL) could be divided into two sublaminae. CB-cells were found mostly in the dorsal half of the SGL, whereas PV-cells were scattered throughout the ventral SGL and the dorsal OL. Most of the CaBP-immunoreactive cells in the SGL were small bipolar cells with vertically oriented dendrites; however, there were also some PV-cells with horizontally oriented dendrites. Quantitative analysis of the CaBP distributions reinforced our observations that these cells are distributed in complementary tiers that are not restricted to the traditional laminae. The size and shape of some of these tiers were determined from a three-dimensional reconstruction of serial sections. The complementarity of the CaBP-immunoreactive tiers was also confirmed by fluorescence microscopy of double-labeled sections, in which few if any double-labeled neurons were observed. Complementary tiers of CB-cells and PV-cells have been observed previously in the SC of the cat. The present results demonstrate them in another species and further suggest that there are functional sublaminae in the SC that can be distinguished by CaBP content.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Regional, cellular, and subcellular localization of RGS10 in rodent <BrainRegion>brain</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The regulator of G protein signaling type 10 (RGS10) modulates Galphai/o signaling by means of its GTPase accelerating activity and is abundantly expressed in <BrainRegion>brain</BrainRegion> and in immune tissues. To elucidate RGS10 function in the nervous system, we mapped RGS10 protein in rat and mouse <BrainRegion>brain</BrainRegion> using light microscopic (LM) and electron microscopic (EM) immunohistochemical techniques. The LM showed that RGS10-like immunoreactivity (LIR) labels all cellular subcompartments of neurons and microglia, including their nuclei. There were several differences between RGS10-LIR distributions in rat and mouse, the most striking of which were the far denser immunoreactivity in rat <BrainRegion>dentate gyrus</BrainRegion> and <BrainRegion>dorsal raphe</BrainRegion>. The EM analysis corroborated and extended our findings from LM. Thus, EM confirmed the presence of dense RGS10-LIR in the euchromatin compartment of nuclei. The EM analysis also resolved dense staining on terminals at symmetric synapses onto pyramidal cell somata. Dual immunofluorescence showed that <BrainRegion>forebrain</BrainRegion> interneurons densely labeled with RGS10-LIR partially colocalized with parvalbumin-LIR. Dual-labeling histochemistry in <BrainRegion>caudoputamen</BrainRegion> demonstrated that densely labeled <BrainRegion>striatal</BrainRegion> cells were biased to the indirect-projecting output pathway. Dual-labeling immunofluorescence also showed that densely labeled RGS10-LIR cells in the <BrainRegion>dentate gyrus subgranular zone</BrainRegion> were not proliferating but that newly born cells could differentiate to express RGS10-LIR. Taken together, these data support a role for RGS10 in diverse processes that include modulation of pre- and postsynaptic G-protein signaling. Moreover, enrichment of RGS10 in transcriptionally active regions of the nucleus suggests an unforeseen role of RGS10 in modulating gene expression.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Immunocytochemical localization of choline acetyltransferase in rat <BrainRegion>cerebral cortex</BrainRegion>: a study of cholinergic neurons and synapses.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), the acetylcholine-synthesizing enzyme and a definitive marker for cholinergic neurons, was localized immunocytochemically in the motor and somatic sensory regions of rat cerebral cortex with monoclonal antibodies. ChAT-positive (ChAT+) varicose fibers and terminal-like structures were distributed in a loose network throughout the <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion>. Some immunoreactive <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> fibers were continuous with those in the white matter underlying the <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion>, and many of these fibers presumably originated from <BrainRegion>subcortical</BrainRegion> cholinergic neurons. ChAT+ fibers appeared to be rather evenly distributed throughout all layers of the <BrainRegion>motor cortex</BrainRegion>, but a subtle laminar pattern was evident in the <BrainRegion>somatic sensory cortex</BrainRegion>, where lower concentrations of fibers in layer IV contrasted with higher concentrations in layer V. Electron microscopy demonstrated that immunoreaction product was concentrated in synaptic vesicle-filled profiles and that many of these structures formed synaptic contacts. ChAT+ synapses were present in all <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> layers, and the majority were of the symmetric type, although a few asymmetric ones were also observed. The most common postsynaptic elements were small to medium-sized dendritic shafts of unidentified origin. In addition, ChAT+ terminals formed synaptic contacts with apical and, probably, basilar dendrites of pyramidal neurons, as well as with the somata of ChAT-negative nonpyramidal neurons. ChAT+ cell bodies were present throughout <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> layers II-VI, but were most concentrated in layers II-III. The somata were small in size, and the majority of ChAT+ neurons were bipolar in form, displaying vertically oriented dendrites that often extended across several <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> layers. Electron microscopy confirmed the presence of immunoreaction product within the cytoplasm of small neurons and revealed that they received both symmetric and asymmetric synapses on their somata and proximal dendrites. These observations support an identification of ChAT+ cells as nonpyramidal intrinsic neurons and thus indicate that there is an intrinsic source of cholinergic innervation of the rat <BrainRegion>cerebral cortex</BrainRegion>, as well as the previously described extrinsic sources.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Olfactory receptor neurons express D2 dopamine receptors.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The role of the dopamine (DA) in the <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> (OB) was explored by determining which of the potential target cells express dopamine receptors (DARs). Previously, it was reported that D2-like DAR (D2, D3, and D4 subtypes) radioligand binding is restricted to the outer layers of the <BrainRegion>OB</BrainRegion>. The neuronal elements present only in these layers are the axons of the olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) and the juxtaglomerular (JG) neurons of the glomerular layer. Based on this pattern of D2-like ligand binding, it was suggested that D2-like receptors might be located presynaptically on ORN terminals. The present study was undertaken to investigate this hypothesis. In the outer bulb layers of rats in which the ORNs were destroyed by nasal lavage with ZnSO(4), D2-like radioligand binding was reduced severely. The receptor subtype D2 mRNA, but not D3 mRNA, was detected in adult rat <BrainRegion>olfactory epithelial</BrainRegion> tissue. By using in situ hybridization, this D2 mRNA was located preferentially in epithelial layers that contain ORN perikarya. D2 mRNA was eliminated after bulbectomy, a manipulation known to cause retrograde degeneration of the mature ORNs. Taken together, the surgical manipulations indicate that mature ORNs express D2 DARs and are consistent with the hypothesis that functional receptors are translocated to their axons and terminals in the bulb. This suggests that dopamine released from JG interneurons could be capable of presynaptically influencing neurotransmission from the olfactory nerve terminals to OB target cells through the D2 receptor.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Vocal circuitry in Xenopus laevis: <BrainRegion>telencephalon</BrainRegion> to laryngeal motor neurons.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Sexually differentiated calling patterns of Xenopus laevis are conveyed to the vocal organ by a dedicated neuromuscular system. Here, we define afferents to vocal motor neurons and determine whether the connectivity of the vocal pathway is sexually differentiated. The use of fluorescent dextran amines and the isolated brain preparation readily permitted identification of anterograde and retrograde connectivity patterns. The whole-mount preparation allowed us to observe projections in their entirety, including cells of origin of a projection (for retrograde projections), terminal fields (for anterograde connections), and fiber tracts. Major findings are the confirmation of a robust and reciprocal connection between <BrainRegion>cranial nucleus</BrainRegion> (n.) IX-X and the <BrainRegion>pretrigeminal nucleus</BrainRegion> of the <BrainRegion>dorsal tegmental area of the medulla</BrainRegion> (DTAM) as well as between <BrainRegion>DTAM</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>ventral striatum</BrainRegion> (VS). Newly revealed is the extensive connectivity between the <BrainRegion>rostral subdivision of the dorsal nucleus raphe</BrainRegion> (rRpd) and <BrainRegion>candidate vocal nuclei</BrainRegion>. In contrast to previous results using peroxidase, we did not observe dramatic sex differences in connectivity, although some connections were less robust in female than in male brains. Some retrograde connections previously observed (e.g., <BrainRegion>anterior preoptic area</BrainRegion> to <BrainRegion>DTAM</BrainRegion>) were not confirmed. Plausible hypotheses are that a set of <BrainRegion>rhombencephalic</BrainRegion> neurons located in <BrainRegion>DTAM</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>inferior reticular formation</BrainRegion> and n.IX-X are responsible for generating patterned vocal activity, that activity is modulated by neurons in <BrainRegion>rRpd</BrainRegion>, and that activity in <BrainRegion>VS</BrainRegion> (particularly that evoked by conspecific calls), together with effects of steroid hormones at many sites in the vocal circuit, contribute to the initiation of calling.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Transient prenatal expression of NPY-Y1 receptor in trigeminal axons innervating the mystacial vibrissae.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Using immunohistochemistry in combination with confocal laser scanning microscopy, we studied the ontogeny of neuropeptide Y-Y1 receptor (Y1-R) expression in the trigeminal system of the rat. The study was limited to the nerve fibers innervating the mystacial pad and the trigeminal ganglia. In the trigeminal ganglia, Y1-R-immunoreactive (IR) neurons were first observed at E16.5. At this same stage some nerve fibers in the <BrainRegion>trigeminal ganglia</BrainRegion> also exhibited Y1-R-like immunoreactivity (LI). Strongly Y1-R-IR nerve fibers innervating the follicles of the mystacial vibrissae were first observed at E18. After double labeling, the Y1-R-LI was found to be colocalized with the neuronal marker protein gene product 9.5. At P1 only weak labeling for the Y1-R was found around the vibrissae follicles, whereas the neurons in the <BrainRegion>trigeminal ganglia</BrainRegion> were intensely labeled. The same was true for the adult rat, but at this stage no Y1-R labeling at all was observed in nerve fibers around the vibrissal follicles. These results strongly support an axonal localization of the Y1-R at this developmental stage. The transient expression of the Y1-R during prenatal mystacial pad development suggests a role for the Y1-R in the functional development of the vibrissae.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Up-regulation of tyrosine kinase (Trka, Trkb) receptor expression and phosphorylation in lumbosacral dorsal root ganglia after chronic <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> (T8-T10) injury.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Previous studies have demonstrated changes in urinary bladder neurotrophic factors after bladder dysfunction. We have hypothesized that retrograde transport of neurotrophin(s) from the bladder to lumbosacral dorsal root ganglia (DRG) may play a role in bladder reflex reorganization after <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> injury (SCI). In this study, we determined whether the expression of tyrosine kinase receptors (TrkA, TrkB) is altered in lumbosacral DRG after SCI through immunofluorescence techniques. Complete transection of the <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion> (T8-T10) was performed in female Wistar rats (120-150 g), and animals were studied 5-6 weeks after SCI. One week before killing, Fast Blue (FB) was injected into the bladder to label bladder afferent cells in the L1, L2, L6, and S1 DRG. After SCI, a significant increase in the number of TrkA-immunoreactive (IR) positive cells was detected in the L6-S1 DRG (L6: 1.9-fold, P &amp;lt; or = 0.01; S1: 1.7-fold, P &lt; or = 0.05) and in the L1 DRG (3.0-fold; P &lt; or = 0.01) but not in the L4-L5 DRG compared with spinal-intact (control) rats. After SCI, a significant increase in the number of TrkB-IR cells was also detected in the L6-S1 DRG (L6: 2.2-fold, P &lt; or = 0.01; S1: 1.5-fold, P &lt; or = 0.05) and in the L1-L2 DRG (L1: 1.5-fold, P &lt; or = 0.01; L2: 1.3-fold, P &lt; or = 0.05) but not in the L4-L5 DRG compared with control rats. After SCI, the percentage of FB-labeled cells expressing TrkA immunoreactivity (approximately 68%) or TrkB immunoreactivity (approximately 65%) in L1 and L6 DRG significantly (P &lt; or = 0.01) increased compared with control (20-30%) DRG. After SCI, the percentage of TrkA-IR cells expressing phosphorylated (p)-Trk immunoreactivity significantly increased (1.5- to 2.3-fold increase) in the L1, L6, and S1 DRG. The percentage of TrkB-IR cells expressing p-Trk immunoreactivity after SCI also increased (1.3-fold increase) in the L1 and L6 DRG. These results demonstrate that (1) TrkA and TrkB immunoreactivity is increased in bladder afferent cells after SCI and (2) TrkA and TrkB receptors are phosphorylated in DRG after SCI. Neuroplasticity of lower urinary tract reflexes after SCI may be mediated by both nerve growth factor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Mapping the body representation in the <BrainRegion>SI cortex</BrainRegion> of anesthetized and awake rats.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>We have used single unit recording techniques to map the representation of cutaneous and joint somatosensory modalities in the <BrainRegion>primary somatosensory (SI) cortex</BrainRegion> of both anesthetized and awake rats. The cytoarchitectonic zones within the rat <BrainRegion>SI</BrainRegion> were divided into the following main categories: (1) granular zones (GZs)--areas exhibiting koniocortical cytoarchitecture (i.e., containing dense aggregates of layer IV granule cells), (2) perigranular zones (PGZs)--narrow strips of less granular <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion> surrounding the GZs, and (3) dysgranular zones (DZs)--large areas of dysgranular <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion> enclosed within the <BrainRegion>SI</BrainRegion>. The narrow strip between the <BrainRegion>SI</BrainRegion> and the rostrally adjacent frontal agranular cortex was termed the &quot;transitional zone" (TZ). Initial computer-based studies of the properties of cutaneous receptive fields (RFs) in <BrainRegion>SI</BrainRegion> showed that, although there were differences in response threshold, adaptability, frequency response, and overall RF size and shape of adjacent neurons, the size and location of the &quot;centers" of the RFs were quite constant and were similar to those seen in multiple unit recordings. The same was true of RFs of single neurons recorded through different anesthetic states. The body representation in <BrainRegion>SI</BrainRegion> was first mapped by determining single unit and unit cluster RFs within a total of 2,170 microelectrode penetrations in barbiturate-anesthetized rats. Cutaneous RFs in the GZs were quite discrete. Thus, a single, finely detailed, continuous map of the cutaneous periphery was definable within the GZs themselves. Only the forepaw had a double representation. RFs in the PGZs were larger and more diffuse, but since they covered roughly the same skin areas as the RFs in the most closely adjacent GZs, they fit into the same body map. Neurons in the DZs were unresponsive to any sensory stimuli in the anesthetized animal. In chronically implanted, freely moving, awake animals cutaneous RFs were larger and more volatile than in the anesthetized, but the accuracy of the map was clearly preserved by the fact that the locations of the RF centers (which often must be defined quantitatively) were unchanged. The PGZs and DZs in the awake animals exhibited a multimodal convergence of cutaneous and joint movement RFs within single vertical penetrations, or even on single neurons. Directionally specific and bilateral cutaneous RFs were also observed in the DZs. It was concluded the DZs are more associational or integrative areas within the <BrainRegion>SI</BrainRegion>, but they could not be shown to comprise a distinct and separate body representation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Dopamine transporter immunoreactivity in monkey <BrainRegion>cerebral cortex</BrainRegion>: regional, laminar, and ultrastructural localization.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Dopamine (DA) influences a number of cognitive and motor functions that are mediated by the primate <BrainRegion>cerebral cortex</BrainRegion>, and the DA membrane transporter (DAT) is known to be a critical regulator of DA neurotransmission in <BrainRegion>subcortical</BrainRegion> structures in rodents. To gain insight into the possible functional role of <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> DAT, we compared the regional, laminar, and ultrastructural distribution of DAT immunoreactivity to that of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate-limiting enzyme in DA synthesis, in the <BrainRegion>cerebral cortex</BrainRegion> of macaque monkeys. DAT-immunoreactive (DAT-IR) axons were present throughout the cortical mantle, with substantial differences in density and laminar distribution across cytoarchitectonic areas. In particular, high densities of DAT-IR axons were present in certain regions (e.g., <BrainRegion>posterior parietal cortex</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>dentate gyrus</BrainRegion>) not previously thought to receive a substantial DA input. The laminar distribution of DAT-IR axons ranged from a restricted localization of labeled axons to layer 1 in lightly innervated regions to the presence of axons in all six <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> layers, with a particularly dense plexus in deep layer 3, in highly innervated regions. These regional and laminar patterns paralleled those of TH-IR axons, but several differences in fiber morphology and ultrastructural localization of DAT were observed. For example, in contrast to TH, DAT immunoreactivity in the <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion> was localized predominantly to small-diameter profiles, whereas, in the <BrainRegion>dorsolateral caudate nucleus</BrainRegion>, DAT and TH immunoreactivities were present in both large-diameter and small-diameter profiles, which may represent varicose and intervaricose axon segments, respectively. Overall, the distribution of DAT-IR axons confirms and extends the results of previous reports, using other markers of DA axons, that the DA innervation of the primate <BrainRegion>cerebral cortex</BrainRegion> is global but specialized on both a regional basis and a laminar basis. In particular, these observations reveal an anatomical substrate for a direct and potent influence of DA over neuronal activity in <BrainRegion>posterior parietal cortex</BrainRegion> and in certain regions of the <BrainRegion>temporal lobe</BrainRegion>. However, due to its predominant distribution to small-diameter profiles, immunoreactivity for DAT may not be an appropriate ultrastructural marker for larger DA varicosities in the primate <BrainRegion>cortex</BrainRegion>. Moreover, this distribution of DAT suggests that <BrainRegion>cortical</BrainRegion> DA fibers may permit greater neurotransmitter diffusion than <BrainRegion>subcortical</BrainRegion> DA axons.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Cholinergic elements in the zebrafish central nervous system: Histochemical and immunohistochemical analysis.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Recently, the zebrafish has been extensively used for studying the development of the central nervous system (CNS). However, the zebrafish CNS has been poorly analyzed in the adult. The cholinergic/cholinoceptive system of the zebrafish CNS was analyzed by using choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) immunohistochemistry and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) histochemistry in the <BrainRegion>brain</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>spinal cord</BrainRegion>. AChE labeling was more abundant and more widely distributed than ChAT immunoreactivity. In the <BrainRegion>telencephalon</BrainRegion>, ChAT-immunoreactive (ChAT-ir) cells were absent, whereas AChE-positive neurons were observed in both the <BrainRegion>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>telencephalic hemispheres</BrainRegion>. The <BrainRegion>diencephalon</BrainRegion> was the region with the lowest density of AChE-positive cells, mainly located in the <BrainRegion>pretectum</BrainRegion>, whereas ChAT-ir cells were exclusively located in the <BrainRegion>preoptic region</BrainRegion>. ChAT-ir cells were restricted to the <BrainRegion>periventricular stratum of the optic tectum</BrainRegion>, but AChE-positive neurons were observed throughout the whole extension of the lamination except in the <BrainRegion>marginal stratum</BrainRegion>. Although ChAT immunoreactivity was restricted to the <BrainRegion>rostral tegmental</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>oculomotor</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>trochlear nuclei</BrainRegion> within the <BrainRegion>mesencephalic tegmentum</BrainRegion>, a widespread distribution of AChE reactivity was observed in this region. The isthmic region showed abundant AChE-positive and ChAT-ir cells in the isthmic, secondary gustatory and <BrainRegion>superior reticular nucleus</BrainRegion> and in the <BrainRegion>nucleus lateralis valvulae</BrainRegion>. ChAT immunoreactivity was absent in the <BrainRegion>cerebellum</BrainRegion>, although AChE staining was observed in Purkinje and granule cells. The <BrainRegion>medulla oblongata</BrainRegion> showed a widespread distribution of AChE-positive cells in all main subdivisions, including the <BrainRegion>octavolateral area</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>reticular formation</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>motor nuclei of the cranial nerves</BrainRegion>. ChAT-ir elements in this area were restricted to the <BrainRegion>descending octaval nucleus</BrainRegion>, the <BrainRegion>octaval efferent nucleus</BrainRegion> and the <BrainRegion>motor nuclei of the cranial nerves</BrainRegion>. Additionally, spinal cord motoneurons appeared positive to both markers. Substantial differences in the ChAT and AChE distribution between zebrafish and other fish species were observed, which could be important because zebrafish is widely used as a genetic or developmental animal model.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Differential synaptic organization of GABAergic bipolar cells and non-GABAergic (glutamatergic) bipolar cells in the tiger salamander <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The synaptic organizations of gamma-aminobutyric acid-immunoreactive (GABA-IR, GABAergic) and non-GABA-IR (non-IR, glutamatergic) bipolar cells in salamander <BrainRegion>retina</BrainRegion> were compared by postembedding immunoelectron microscopy. A total of 238 presynaptic bipolar cell synapses were studied; 61 were GABA-IR and 177 were non-IR. Both groups were similar in that (1). they made asymmetrical ribbon synapses as well as asymmetrical non-ribbon synapses; (2). they made ribbon synapses at dyads, triads, and monads; and (3). the vast majority of ribbon synapses ( approximately 90%) were with dyads. The differences were that synapses of GABA-IR bipolar cells had a higher proportion of (1). direct contact with ganglion cells, (2). non-ribbon synapses, (3). output to GABA-IR amacrine cells, and (4). output in sublamina a. Overall, the output of GABA-IR ribbons was equally split between amacrine and ganglion cell processes, whereas for non-IR ribbons, it was approximately 2:1 in favor of amacrine cells. The ribbon:non-ribbon synapse ratio was approximately 1.2:1 (33:28) for GABA-IR but approximately 2:1 (118:59) for non-IR terminals. Thus, GABA-IR bipolar cells made more direct contacts with ganglion cells and used a higher proportion of non-ribbon synapses. GABA-IR dyads were more likely to contact GABA-IR amacrine profiles (52% vs. 38%). Finally, GABA-IR ribbon synapses were more common in sublamina a than sublamina b (2:1), whereas non-IR synapses were equally present in sublaminas a and b. This differential targeting of ganglion cells and amacrine cells in the OFF vs. ON layers indicates a difference in the role of bipolar cells in the generation of receptive field properties, depending on whether or not they use GABA as well as glutamate for their transmitter.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Spatial organization of inner hair cell synapses and <BrainRegion>cochlear spiral ganglion</BrainRegion> neurons.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The morphological organization of the central projections of the cat <BrainRegion>cochlear spiral ganglion</BrainRegion> into the <BrainRegion>cochlear nucleus</BrainRegion> was previously investigated by creating restricted lesions in the <BrainRegion>anteroventral cochlear nucleus</BrainRegion> (AVCN) to ablate selectively either the lateral or the medial aspect of isofrequency projection laminae. Such lesions resulted in highly selective retrograde degeneration of <BrainRegion>spiral ganglion</BrainRegion> cells. Ablation of the <BrainRegion>lateral part of the AVCN</BrainRegion> caused degeneration of cells within the <BrainRegion>scala tympani</BrainRegion> part of the ganglion, whereas medial ablations within the <BrainRegion>AVCN</BrainRegion> induced degeneration of the <BrainRegion>scala vestibuli</BrainRegion> aspect of the ganglion. The peripheral axons also degenerated and this fiber loss exhibited selective topographies that paralleled the cell loss within the <BrainRegion>spiral ganglion</BrainRegion>, although this phenomenon was more prominent in the proximal part of the osseous spiral lamina near the ganglion and less obvious more distally near the <BrainRegion>habenula perforata</BrainRegion>. In this investigation, inner hair cells (IHCs) from these selective lesion cases were evaluated by electron microscopy of serial sections through the basal synaptic regions. Results demonstrated differential degeneration of afferent synapses, with greater (but not completely selective) loss of pillar synapses after <BrainRegion>lateral AVCN</BrainRegion> lesions and greater loss of modiolar synapses after medial lesions. Because <BrainRegion>auditory nerve</BrainRegion> fibers of different spontaneous discharge rates (SRs) have different spatial distributions on the IHC (Liberman, Science 216:1239, 1982), our results suggest that this SR-based organization is maintained in a topographic organization across the vertical (<BrainRegion>scala tympani</BrainRegion>-to-<BrainRegion>scala vestibuli</BrainRegion>) dimension of the <BrainRegion>spiral ganglion</BrainRegion> cell cluster and carried into the <BrainRegion>ventral cochlear nuclei</BrainRegion> (VCN). Thus, in addition to the spiral frequency organization represented by the dorsal-to-ventral frequency map in the <BrainRegion>VCN</BrainRegion>, there is also an orderly organization of inputs from high- and low-SR fibers across the lateral-to-medial dimension of the <BrainRegion>VCN</BrainRegion> such that the lateral isofrequency laminae receive a proportionately greater input from high-SR fibers, whereas medial isofrequency laminae receive preferential input from low- and medium-SR fibers.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Sex differences in densities of dopaminergic fibers and GABAergic neurons in the prenatal rat <BrainRegion>striatum</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>On the basis of observations on dopaminergic neurons developing in gender-specific cultures of embryonic rat <BrainRegion>mesencephalon</BrainRegion>, we have hypothesized that as yet unknown sexual dimorphisms might be found in projection areas of dopaminergic neurons. Therefore we searched for possible sex differences in the <BrainRegion>striatum</BrainRegion> during the period when massive ingrowth of <BrainRegion>mesencephalic</BrainRegion> afferents occurs and the <BrainRegion>striatal</BrainRegion> gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic neurons differentiate. Male and female rats of embryonic days (E) 16, 18, 20, and 21 were fixed by perfusion through the heart. Vibratome sections were cut from the <BrainRegion>striatal anlage</BrainRegion> and sequentially immunostained for GABA by the immunogold-silver technique and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) by the avidin-biotin-peroxidase method. Ultrathin sections were scanned for numbers of GABA- and TH-immunoreactive (IR) elements. Densities of TH-IR axons as well as of GABA-IR cell body profiles progressed with time. Contacts between TH-IR axons and GABA-IR and immunonegative cells were observed as early as E-16, increasing in numbers toward later stages. Throughout prenatal development, female <BrainRegion>striata</BrainRegion> displayed higher densities of both TH-IR axon and GABA-IR cell body profiles than male ones. This is the first report of a distinct anatomical sex difference regarding two major components of a key center of motor control. Prenatal sexual differentiation of the <BrainRegion>striatum</BrainRegion> may lead to a sexually dimorphic extrapyramidal circuitry, the existence of which, in the adult, is suggested by experimental and clinical data.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Three classes of inhibitory amino acid terminals in the <BrainRegion>cochlear nucleus</BrainRegion> of the guinea pig.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Electron microscopic postembedding immunocytochemistry was used to analyze and assess the synaptic distribution of glycine (GLY) and gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) immunoreactivities in the guinea pig <BrainRegion>cochlear nucleus</BrainRegion> (CN). Three classes of endings were identified containing immunolabeling for glycine, GABA, or both glycine and GABA (GLY/GABA). All classes were similar in that the terminals contained pleomorphic vesicles and formed symmetric synapses with their postsynaptic targets. A fourth class, which labeled with neither antibody, contained round vesicles and formed asymmetric synapses. Glycine endings predominated in the <BrainRegion>ventral CN</BrainRegion>, while GLY/GABA endings were prevalent in the <BrainRegion>dorsal CN</BrainRegion>. GABA endings were the least common and smallest in size. Glycine, GLY/GABA, and GABA endings differed in their proportions and patterns of distribution on the different classes of projection neurons in the <BrainRegion>CN</BrainRegion>, including spherical bushy, type I stellate/multipolar, and octopus cells in the <BrainRegion>ventral CN</BrainRegion> and fusiform cells in the <BrainRegion>dorsal CN</BrainRegion>. The vast majority of anatomically-defined, putative inhibitory endings contain GLY, GABA, or both, suggesting that most of the inhibition in the <BrainRegion>cochlear nucleus</BrainRegion> is mediated by these three cytochemically and, probably, functionally distinct classes of endings. The results of this study also suggest that a large proportion of the GABA available for inhibition in the <BrainRegion>CN</BrainRegion> coexists in terminals with glycine.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Anatomical relationships between aromatase and tyrosine hydroxylase in the quail <BrainRegion>brain</BrainRegion>: double-label immunocytochemical studies.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The activation of male sexual behavior in Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) requires the transformation of testosterone to 17beta-estradiol by the enzyme aromatase (estrogen synthetase). There are prominent sex differences in aromatase activity that may be regulated in part by sex differences in catecholaminergic activity. In this study, we investigate, with double-label immunocytochemistry methods, the anatomical relationship between the catecholamine synthesizing enzyme, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and aromatase (ARO) in the quail <BrainRegion>brain</BrainRegion>. The immunoreactivity observed for each antigen generally matched the previously described distribution. One exception is the observation that cells weakly labeled for aromatase were found widely distributed throughout the <BrainRegion>telencephalon</BrainRegion>. The presence of <BrainRegion>telencephalic</BrainRegion> aromatase was confirmed independently by radioenzymatic assays. There was an extensive overlap between the distribution of the two antigens in many <BrainRegion>brain areas</BrainRegion>. In all densely labeled aromatase-immunoreactive (ARO-ir) cell groups, including the <BrainRegion>preoptic medial nucleus</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>nucleus of the stria terminalis</BrainRegion>, <BrainRegion>mediobasal hypothalamus</BrainRegion>, and <BrainRegion>paleostriatum ventrale</BrainRegion>, ARO-ir cells were found in close association with TH-ir fibers. These TH-ir fibers often converged on an ARO-ir cell, and one or more TH-ir <BrainRegion>punctate structure</BrainRegion>(s) were found in close contact with nearly every densely labeled ARO-ir cell. In the telencephalon (mostly the <BrainRegion>neostriatum</BrainRegion>), all TH-ir fibers were found to be part of fiber groups that surrounded weakly immunoreactive aromatase cells. The few cells exhibiting an intracellular colocalization were detected in the <BrainRegion>anteroventral periventricular nucleus</BrainRegion>. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that catecholaminergic inputs regulate <BrainRegion>brain</BrainRegion> aromatase.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle>

<ArticleTitle>Adult testosterone levels influence the morphology of a sexually dimorphic area in the Mongolian gerbil <BrainRegion>brain</BrainRegion>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>This research shows that the <BrainRegion>medial preoptic area</BrainRegion>-<BrainRegion>anterior hypothalamus</BrainRegion> (MPOA-AH) of the gerbil contains a sexually dimorphic area (SDA) whose morphology is influenced by adult gonadal steroids. The characteristics of the SDA were studied initially in gonadally intact males and females and later in males and females that had been gonadectomized or gonadectomized and given testosterone. Coronal sections through the <BrainRegion>MPOA</BrainRegion>-<BrainRegion>AH</BrainRegion> were stained with thionin to visualize the SDA. In male gerbils, the SDA is a darkly staining, hook-shaped structure on either side of the <BrainRegion>third ventricle</BrainRegion>, above the <BrainRegion>suprachiasmatic nuclei</BrainRegion> and below the <BrainRegion>anterior commissure</BrainRegion>. Within the male SDA lies a small, dense cluster of cells, the SDA <BrainRegion>pars compacta</BrainRegion> (SDApc). In female gerbils, the SDA is more ovoid and diffuse and the SDApc is absent. Camera lucida tracings and planimeter measurements of the SDA showed that the total volume of the SDA is similar in the two sexes, but the proportion of the SDA that stains darkly and/or stands out clearly from the surround (dark volume) is larger in males. Gonadectomy decreases both total and dark volume of the SDA in both sexes and decreases the volume of the SDApc in males. Testosterone treatment prevents these changes. This is the first report of changes in the gross morphology of the mammalian brain after steroid hormone manipulations in adulthood. The changes in the SDA may be related to testosterone activation of scent marking behavior.</AbstractText></PubmedArticle></PubmedArticles>
